### 🎯 Revolutionary Workflow: Spec-Driven Development

#### **Phase 1: Feature Specification (`/specify`)**

**Command:**

```bash
/specify "24/7 Biology doubt resolution AI chatbot with personalized learning paths for NEET students. Must support voice queries, provide detailed explanations with diagrams, track learning progress, and integrate with existing payment system. Should handle 1000+ concurrent users with <2 second response time."
```

**Output:** Creates `.specify/features/ai-chatbot/spec.md` with:

- ✅ Educational learning scenarios
- ✅ Student acceptance criteria
- ✅ Learning outcome requirements
- ✅ Revenue impact analysis
- ✅ NEET curriculum alignment
- ✅ Performance requirements

#### **Phase 2: Implementation Planning (`/plan`)**

**Command:**

```bash
/plan "Next.js 15.5.3, TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4, WebSocket, Prisma PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, MCP integration, Voice Recognition API, WhatsApp Business API integration, Razorpay payment system"
```

**Output:** Creates `.specify/features/ai-chatbot/plan.md` with:

- ✅ Technical architecture decisions
- ✅ Component design and data flow
- ✅ API contracts and database schema
- ✅ Integration points with existing systems
- ✅ Performance optimization strategy

#### **Phase 3: Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)**

**Command:**

```bash
/tasks "Focus on education-first architecture, ensure revenue impact tracking, maintain 94.2% success rate standards, implement proper testing for AI responses, ensure Indian market optimization"
```

**Output:** Creates `.specify/features/ai-chatbot/tasks.md` with:

- ✅ Dependency-ordered task list
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities
- ✅ Testing requirements for AI accuracy
- ✅ Education-specific quality gates
- ✅ Revenue tracking implementation

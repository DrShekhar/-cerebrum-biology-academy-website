## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need all 5 features or can I deploy some?

**A:** You can deploy features independently, but they work best together. Minimum viable: Calendar + SMS + Referral.

### Q: What happens if Twilio/Razorpay is down?

**A:**

- SMS fails → Booking still succeeds (graceful degradation)
- Razorpay fails → Payment can't be processed, show error, allow retry

### Q: Can users reschedule multiple times?

**A:** Currently limited to 1 reschedule per link. Generate new link for additional reschedules.

### Q: How do I prevent referral abuse?

**A:** Built-in protections:

- Max 10 uses per code
- One-time redemption per user email
- Expiration dates supported
- Usage tracking in database

### Q: What's the refund policy for premium demos?

**A:** Define your own. Implement refund logic via Razorpay API.

**More FAQs:** See troubleshooting section in each feature's documentation

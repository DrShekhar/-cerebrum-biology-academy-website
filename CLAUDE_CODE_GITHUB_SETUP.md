```

### 4. Verify GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. You should see "Claude Code" in the workflows list
4. The workflow will run automatically when you mention `@claude`

## üöÄ How to Use

### In GitHub Issues

1. **Create a new issue** or comment on existing one
2. **Mention @claude** in the issue body or comment
3. **Describe your task**, for example:

```
@claude Please review the database connectivity code in /src/lib/db/instant.ts
and suggest improvements for production deployment.
```

4. **Claude will respond** with code analysis, suggestions, or implementations

### In Pull Requests

1. **Create a PR** or comment on existing one
2. **Mention @claude** in review comments or PR description
3. **Ask for code review**, for example:

```
@claude Can you review this API implementation and check for security issues?
```

4. **Claude will analyze** the PR and provide feedback

## üìù Example Use Cases

### 1. Code Review Request

```
@claude Please review the changes in this PR for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices compliance
- TypeScript type safety
```

### 2. Bug Investigation

```
@claude I'm getting a 500 error in /api/demo-booking.
Can you analyze the error logs and suggest a fix?
```

### 3. Feature Implementation

```
@claude Please implement real Zoom API integration replacing the simulation
in /src/lib/zoom/zoomService.ts following the TODO.md requirements.
```

### 4. Architecture Advice

```
@claude Should we use Supabase or InstantDB for production database?
Please analyze based on our NEET Biology Academy requirements.
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

```
@claude The test generator page is slow on 3G networks.
Can you suggest optimizations?
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Configuration

### Triggers

The workflow runs when:

- ‚úÖ New issue is created with `@claude` in title or body
- ‚úÖ Issue is assigned and contains `@claude`
- ‚úÖ Comment on issue contains `@claude`
- ‚úÖ PR review comment contains `@claude`
- ‚úÖ PR review body contains `@claude`

### Permissions

- **Read**: Repository contents
- **Write**: Issues and pull requests (to post responses)

### Actions Used

- `actions/checkout@v4` - Checks out repository code
- `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` - Runs Claude Code

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** - Always use GitHub Secrets
2. **Review Claude's suggestions** - Always validate AI-generated code
3. **Test changes locally** - Don't merge untested code
4. **Monitor API usage** - Check Anthropic console for costs

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

- **Claude API costs** apply based on usage
- **Approximate costs**:
  - Small code review: ~$0.05-0.20
  - Medium feature implementation: ~$0.50-1.00
  - Large refactoring: ~$1.00-3.00
- **Monitor usage** at https://console.anthropic.com/

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running?

1. Check GitHub Actions is enabled: **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
3. Check if `@claude` is spelled correctly in issue/PR

### Permission errors?

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**
3. Click **Save**

### API errors?

1. Verify API key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Check API usage limits and billing
3. Review workflow logs in **Actions** tab for detailed errors

## üìä Workflow Logs

To view workflow execution:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **Claude Code** workflow
3. Select the specific run
4. View logs for each step

## üéØ Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good @claude Mentions

```
@claude Review this authentication implementation for security vulnerabilities.

@claude Implement the Zoom integration as specified in TODO.md, section "CRITICAL: Activate Live Zoom Integration".

@claude Analyze the database connectivity error and provide a fix with proper error handling.
```

### ‚ùå Avoid Vague Mentions

```
@claude Fix this
@claude Help
@claude What do you think?
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  env:
    NODE_ENV: production
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}

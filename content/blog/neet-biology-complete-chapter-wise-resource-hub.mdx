At Cerebrum Biology Academy, we've trained over 5,000 NEET aspirants, and the consistent pattern among 650+ scorers is this:

- **Master Concepts First**: Never memorize without understanding
- **Use This Hub Systematically**: Don't jump between chapters
- **Test Yourself**: Mock tests after every 3-4 chapters
- **Analyze Mistakes**: Understand where you went wrong, not just correct answers
- **Stick to NCERT + One Reference**: Don't use 5 different books
- **Revise Multiple Times**: Final revision should happen 3-4 times

### Final Words

This resource hub contains all the information you need to score 320+ in NEET Biology. The chapters are arranged in the most logical sequence. Begin with Unit 1 (Diversity), proceed methodically, and by the time you complete Unit 9 (Ecology), you'll have developed a complete understanding of NEET Biology.

Remember: NEET is not a test of memory; it's a test of understanding. Use this hub to develop deep conceptual understanding, and success will follow.

**Best wishes from Cerebrum Biology Academy and Dr. Shekhar.**

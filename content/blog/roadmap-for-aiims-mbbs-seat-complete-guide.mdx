# Complete Roadmap for Getting an AIIMS MBBS Seat

Every year, over 20 lakh students appear for NEET UG. Fewer than 2,300 of them will secure an MBBS seat at one of India's AIIMS institutes. That is roughly a 0.1% selection rate -- among the most competitive admission processes in the world.

But here is what most students get wrong: they treat AIIMS as some mythical, unreachable goal. The truth is far more practical. Getting into AIIMS is an engineering problem. It requires the right score, which comes from the right strategy, which comes from the right timeline.

This guide lays out that entire roadmap -- from understanding the landscape to building a day-by-day plan that puts an AIIMS seat within your reach. No shortcuts. No false promises. Just a clear, data-driven path built from the experience of those who have walked it.

Whether you are starting in Class 11 with two full years or making a single determined year count as a dropper, this roadmap adapts to your timeline.

## Understanding the AIIMS Landscape in 2026

India currently has **25 AIIMS institutes**, of which **20 are fully operational** and admitting MBBS students. The remaining 5 are under construction.

| Category                  | Count  | Total MBBS Seats |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Operational AIIMS         | 20     | ~2,257           |
| Under Construction        | 5      | ~625 (expected)  |
| **Total (when all open)** | **25** | **~2,882**       |

### Key AIIMS Institutes

| AIIMS Institute    | State          | MBBS Seats | NIRF Rank (2024) |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| AIIMS New Delhi    | Delhi          | 125        | 1st               |
| AIIMS Jodhpur      | Rajasthan      | 125        | 16th              |
| AIIMS Bhubaneswar  | Odisha         | 125        | 17th              |
| AIIMS Rishikesh    | Uttarakhand    | 125        | 14th              |

| Other AIIMS (10)   | Various        | ~1,007     | Various           |

### How Admission Works

Since 2020, all AIIMS admissions happen through **NEET UG + MCC All India Counselling**. There is no separate AIIMS entrance exam.

- 100% seats filled through All India Quota -- no state quota
- Annual tuition fee is approximately Rs 5,856/year -- virtually free
- Reservation follows central government norms (OBC, SC, ST, EWS, PwD)

> **Important:** Your NEET rank is the only factor. Board marks, extracurriculars, and interviews play zero role. Your entire AIIMS dream rests on one number -- your NEET score.

## The 2-Year Roadmap: Starting from Class 11

This is the ideal timeline. Starting in Class 11 gives you the luxury of time -- your greatest advantage.

### Year 1 (Class 11): Build the Foundation

The first year is about **building an unshakeable conceptual foundation**. You are not preparing for NEET yet -- you are building the machine that will prepare for NEET.

**Phase 1 (July-October):** Complete Class 11 NCERT alongside school. Cover Cell Biology, Biomolecules, Plant Morphology in Biology; Mechanics in Physics; Atomic Structure, Chemical Bonding, Equilibrium in Chemistry. Self-study 3-4 hours daily.

**Phase 2 (November-February):** Complete remaining syllabus -- Plant Physiology, Thermodynamics, Organic Chemistry basics. Begin first revision of earlier topics.

**Phase 3 (March-June):** Deep revision. Complete 2 full rounds of NCERT Biology line-by-line. Solve chapter-wise PYQs. Begin making short notes and formula sheets. Take 2-3 topic-wise tests per week.

> **Year 1 Success Metric:** By end of Class 11, score 75%+ on any Class 11 topic test without notes. If you can do this, your foundation is AIIMS-ready.

### Year 2 (Class 12): Accelerate and Conquer

Class 12 topics carry higher NEET weightage. This year combines new learning with intensive Class 11 revision.

**Phase 1 (July-November):** Complete Class 12 syllabus -- Genetics, Human Physiology, Reproduction, Electrostatics, Optics, Organic Chemistry. Study 6-8 hours daily (including school).

**Phase 2 (December-February):** Full syllabus revision. Complete 3-4 rounds of NCERT Biology. Solve 10 years of PYQs. Begin full-length mock tests -- 1 per week minimum.

**Phase 3 (March-May):** 2-3 mock tests per week. Analyze every test for 2 hours. Maintain an error log. Final NCERT rounds in the last 30 days.

> **Year 2 Target:** Mock scores above 680 by March, above 700 by April. Hit these milestones and you are on track for AIIMS.

## The 1-Year Roadmap: For Class 12 Students and Droppers

If you have only one year, every day counts.

| Month     | Phase            | Primary Focus                                     | Mock Tests/Week |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| June      | Foundation Reset | Class 11 NCERT revision (all subjects)            | 0               |
| July      | Foundation Reset | Finish Class 11 + start Class 12 topics           | 0               |
| August    | New Learning     | Class 12 Biology + Physics + Chemistry            | 0-1 (topic)     |
| September | New Learning     | Complete Class 12 syllabus coverage               | 1 (topic)       |
| October   | Consolidation    | Full syllabus first revision + PYQs               | 1 (full)        |
| November  | Consolidation    | Second revision + intensive PYQ solving            | 1-2             |
| December  | Intensification  | Third revision + mock tests + error analysis       | 2               |
| January   | Intensification  | Weak area focus + continued mock tests             | 2-3             |
| February  | Mock Test Phase  | Full mock test mode + targeted revision            | 3               |
| March     | Mock Test Phase  | Peak performance + NCERT re-reads                  | 3-4             |
| April     | Final Revision   | Only revision, short notes, formula sheets         | 2               |
| May       | Exam Month       | Light revision + exam strategy + rest              | 1               |

### Critical Milestones

| Milestone                  | Target Date      | Score Target |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Complete syllabus coverage | End of September | N/A          |
| First full-length mock     | October Week 2   | 550+         |
| Consistent mock score      | December         | 620+         |
| AIIMS-range in mocks       | February         | 680+         |
| Peak performance           | March-April      | 700+         |

> **Dropper Advantage:** You already know the syllabus. Your job is to fill gaps, build speed, and eliminate errors. Spend the first 2 months honestly identifying every weak area, then systematically destroy each one.

---

## Subject-wise Strategy for 700+

### Biology: The Kingmaker (Target: 340+ out of 360)

Biology is 50% of your NEET score and the most predictable subject -- **85-90% of questions come directly from NCERT**.

#### The NCERT Line-by-Line Method

1. **First Read:** Read the entire chapter for flow and understanding
2. **Second Read:** Highlight every factual statement, number, and exception
3. **Third Read:** Convert highlights into self-test questions
4. **Fourth Read:** Cover text, recall from memory, verify against the book
5. **Fifth Read:** Focus only on lines you could not recall

#### High-Yield Biology Chapters

| Chapter                      | Expected Questions | NCERT Dependence |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Human Physiology (all units) | 14-16              | Very High        |
| Genetics & Molecular Biology | 12-14              | Very High        |
| Plant Physiology             | 8-10               | High             |
| Ecology & Environment        | 8-10               | Very High        |
| Cell Biology & Biomolecules  | 6-8                | High             |
| Reproduction                 | 6-8                | Very High        |
| Biotechnology                | 4-6                | High             |

#### Key Biology Tips

- **Diagrams:** Practice drawing and labeling every NCERT diagram -- NEET frequently tests diagram-based questions
- **Assertion-Reason:** Practice at least 200 assertion-reason questions for deep conceptual understanding
- **Comparison Tables:** Mitosis vs meiosis, DNA vs RNA, C3 vs C4 plants -- these are NEET favorites
- **Exceptions List:** Maintain a dedicated list. NEET loves testing exceptions

> **340+ Formula:** 5 rounds of NCERT + 15 years PYQs + 200 assertion-reason questions + 100 diagram-based questions = 340+ is almost guaranteed.

### Physics: The Score Differentiator (Target: 160+ out of 180)

For AIIMS, you cannot afford to drop more than 20 marks in Physics.

| Priority | Chapters                                 | Weightage | Strategy                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Tier 1   | Mechanics (Motion, Work-Energy, Rotation) | 25-30%   | Concept + heavy numerical practice |
| Tier 1   | Electrodynamics (Current, Magnetism)      | 20-25%   | Formula mastery + circuits         |
| Tier 2   | Optics (Ray + Wave)                       | 12-15%   | Diagram-based + formulas           |
| Tier 2   | Modern Physics (Atoms, Nuclei)            | 10-12%   | Direct formula -- high scoring     |
| Tier 3   | Thermodynamics, Waves, Properties         | 15-18%   | Conceptual clarity + PYQs          |

**Physics approach:** Understand before solving. Maintain a 10-15 page formula sheet revised weekly. Solve 50+ numericals per chapter. Focus on NEET-level problems, not JEE-level. Use dimensional analysis to eliminate wrong options.

### Chemistry: The Balanced Attack (Target: 160+ out of 180)

| Section             | Weightage | Study Approach            | Key Resource           |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Organic Chemistry   | 30-35%    | Mechanism + reaction maps | NCERT + MS Chouhan     |
| Inorganic Chemistry | 30-35%    | NCERT memorization        | NCERT (read 7-8 times) |
| Physical Chemistry  | 30-35%    | Formula + numerical       | NCERT + N Awasthi      |

**Organic:** Make reaction flowcharts for each functional group. Memorize all named reactions with mechanisms. Practice conversion problems daily.

**Inorganic:** Pure NCERT -- read 7-8 times minimum. Use mnemonics for trends and exceptions. Focus on p-Block, d-Block, and Coordination Compounds.

**Physical:** Build a master formula sheet. Practice 30+ numericals per chapter. Master Equilibrium, Electrochemistry, and Kinetics.

> **Chemistry Insight:** If you must prioritize, Inorganic gives the highest return on time -- it is 100% NCERT-based and rewards memorization over problem-solving skill.

---

## Common Mistakes That Prevent Students from Reaching AIIMS

**Mistake 1: Ignoring NCERT for "Advanced" Books.** Students buy MTG, Trueman, and Dinesh while their NCERT sits untouched. NEET is an NCERT-based exam. Use reference books only after completing NCERT at least 3 times.

**Mistake 2: Starting Mock Tests Too Late.** Many wait until March-April. Start topic-wise tests from month 3 and full-length mocks from month 6.

**Mistake 3: Not Analyzing Mock Tests.** For every 3-hour test, spend 2 hours analyzing -- categorize errors as conceptual, silly, or time-pressure. Maintain an error log.

**Mistake 4: Neglecting Class 11 Topics.** Approximately 40-45% of NEET questions come from Class 11. Ignoring Cell Biology, Plant Morphology, and Mechanics costs easy marks.

**Mistake 5: Poor Negative Marking Management.** Attempt 175-180 questions with 95%+ accuracy rather than all 200. Leaving 5 unanswered beats guessing on 10 and getting 5 wrong.

**Mistake 6: Burnout from Overwork.** Consistent 8-10 hours daily for 12 months beats 16-hour days that last only 6 months. Sleep 7-8 hours. Exercise 30 minutes daily. Take one half-day off per week.

**Mistake 7: No Revision Strategy.** Without planned revision cycles, you forget 60-70% within a month. Follow spaced repetition:

| When First Studied | Revision 1 | Revision 2 | Revision 3 | Revision 4 |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Day 0               | Day 1      | Day 7      | Day 30     | Day 90     |

**Total Study: 10.5 hours/day (with proper breaks)**

> **Non-Negotiable Rules:** Sleep 7-8 hours -- your brain consolidates memory during sleep. Exercise 30 minutes daily -- it improves focus and reduces anxiety. Take one half-day off per week -- burnout will destroy your preparation faster than any weak chapter.

---

## The Final 30 Days and Exam Day Strategy

The last month is not for learning new things. It is for sharpening what you already know.

| Week   | Focus                                                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | Complete NCERT re-read (all 3 subjects), 2 mock tests    |
| Week 2 | Revise formula sheets + short notes, 2 mock tests        |
| Week 3 | Focus only on high-weightage chapters, 1-2 mock tests    |
| Week 4 | Light revision, exam strategy practice, rest and relax    |

### Exam Day Paper Sequence

1. **Attempt Biology first** if you are Biology-strong -- it builds confidence and takes less time
2. **Then Chemistry** -- Inorganic questions are quick to solve
3. **Physics last** -- give yourself maximum time for calculations
4. **Mark and skip:** If a question takes more than 2 minutes, move on and return later
5. **Do not guess blindly.** Eliminate 2 options first, then choose. Otherwise, leave it

## Your AIIMS Journey Starts Today

The best time to start was two years ago. The second-best time is right now.

Whether you are in Class 11 with two full years ahead, in Class 12 with one intense year, or a dropper determined to make this count -- the principles do not change:

1. **Master NCERT** -- it is the source of 85% of your marks
2. **Practice relentlessly** -- solve thousands of questions
3. **Test yourself constantly** -- mock tests reveal what textbooks hide
4. **Stay consistent** -- 300 days of 8 hours beats 150 days of 16 hours
5. **Take care of yourself** -- your brain and body are your most important tools

The 0.1% who get into AIIMS are not geniuses. They are disciplined, strategic, and relentless. With the right plan and the right guidance, that 0.1% can include you.

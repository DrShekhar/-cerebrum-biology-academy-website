# NEET 2026 Registration Guide: Complete Step-by-Step Process

**NEET 2026 registration opens on February 8, 2026 at 10:00 AM and closes on March 8, 2026 at 11:50 PM.** This comprehensive guide walks you through every step of the online registration process, document requirements, fee payment, and common mistakes to avoid. With only 28 days to register, understanding the exact process is crucial to prevent last-minute panic.

Over **24.5 lakh students** are expected to register for NEET 2026, and the NTA (National Testing Agency) servers experience heavy traffic during the first and last 3 days. This year, Aadhaar-based eKYC has been made **mandatory** for all candidates, adding an extra verification layer. Missing even one document or making an error in personal details can delay your application or lead to rejection.

**Registration Status Alert:** If you're reading this before February 8, 2026, bookmark this page and set a reminder for 10:00 AM on launch day. If it's already past March 8, this guide will still help you understand what happened in case of future attempts or helping others.

This is the most error-prone section. Follow specifications exactly.

| Document | File Size | Dimensions | Background | Additional Tips |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Photograph** | 10-200 KB | 3.5cm x 4.5cm | White | 80% face, recent (post-Jan 1, 2026), no glasses |

4. Wait for **green checkmark** (✓) confirmation
5. Preview the uploaded document to verify clarity
6. If blurry or incorrect, delete and re-upload

**Common Upload Errors:**
- File size exceeds limit → Compress using online tools
- Wrong format → Convert to JPG (images) or PDF (documents)
- Background not white → Retake/re-scan with white paper
- Blurry image → Use better lighting and steady hands

---

### Step 6: eKYC Verification (Aadhaar-Based)

**NEW in 2026:** Aadhaar-based eKYC is now **mandatory** for all candidates. This adds an extra security layer to prevent impersonation.

#### 6.1 Aadhaar Verification Process

1. After uploading documents, click **"Proceed to eKYC"**
2. Enter your **12-digit Aadhaar Number** (must match what you entered earlier)
3. Verify your **registered mobile number** (the one linked to Aadhaar)
4. Click **"Generate OTP"**
5. Check your mobile for a 6-digit OTP from UIDAI (not NTA)
6. Enter the OTP within 10 minutes
7. System will verify:
   - Name match (Aadhaar vs Application)
   - Date of Birth match
   - Photo match (biometric verification)
8. If successful, you'll see **"eKYC Completed Successfully"** message

#### 6.2 What if eKYC Fails?

**Common Reasons:**
- Name mismatch (even minor spelling differences)
- Mobile number not linked to Aadhaar
- Aadhaar not updated recently
- Face photo doesn't match Aadhaar database

**Solutions:**
1. **Name Mismatch:** Contact NTA helpdesk with proof of name correction
2. **Mobile Not Linked:** Link mobile to Aadhaar at nearest Aadhaar center (takes 24-48 hours)
3. **Aadhaar Outdated:** Update Aadhaar at enrollment center
4. **Photo Mismatch:** Upload a clearer photo matching Aadhaar likeness

**Helpline:** NTA NEET Helpdesk: 011-40759000 / 011-69227700 (Mon-Sat, 10 AM-5 PM)

---

### Step 7: Select Exam City Preferences

You must select **4 exam cities** in order of preference.

**Strategy:**
1. **1st Preference:** Your home city (most convenient)
2. **2nd Preference:** Nearest metro city (more center options)
3. **3rd Preference:** Alternative nearby city (backup)
4. **4th Preference:** Any city with good transport connectivity

**Important Notes:**
- You cannot choose a specific center; NTA assigns based on availability
- Your exam city will be mentioned on the admit card (released in mid-April)
- If none of your 4 preferences are available, NTA assigns the nearest alternative
- **You cannot change city preferences after submission** (not covered in correction window)

**Popular City Choices by Region:**

| Region | Top Cities |
|--------|------------|
| **North** | Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Dehradun |
| **South** | Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Coimbatore, Kochi, Visakhapatnam |
| **West** | Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat, Nagpur, Indore |
| **East** | Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Ranchi, Guwahati |
| **Central** | Bhopal, Indore, Raipur, Jabalpur |

---

### Step 8: Preview and Verify Application

**CRITICAL STEP:** Do NOT skip this. Most mistakes are caught here.

1. Click **"Preview Application"**
2. The system generates a **PDF preview** of your complete application
3. Verify **every single field** carefully:
   - [ ] Name spelling (matches all documents?)
   - [ ] Date of Birth (DD-MM-YYYY correct?)
   - [ ] Father's and Mother's Names (correct spelling?)
   - [ ] Category (correct selection?)
   - [ ] Email ID (typo-free?)
   - [ ] Mobile Number (all 10 digits correct?)
   - [ ] Address (complete and accurate?)
   - [ ] Board and School Name (correct?)
   - [ ] Subjects (all 5 selected?)
   - [ ] Uploaded Documents (clear and visible?)
   - [ ] Exam City Preferences (in correct order?)
4. If anything is wrong, click **"Edit"** and go back to correct it
5. If everything is correct, proceed to payment

**Do NOT proceed to payment if you spot ANY error.** It's much harder (and sometimes impossible) to correct after payment.

---

### Step 9: Pay Application Fee

#### Fee Structure

| Category | Fee Amount | Payment Modes |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **General / Gen-EWS / OBC-NCL** | ₹1,700 | Debit/Credit Card, Net Banking, UPI, Paytm Wallet |
| **SC / ST / PwD / Third Gender** | ₹1,000 | Same as above |
| **International Candidates** (Outside India) | $150 OR ₹9,500 | Credit Card / Demand Draft |

#### Payment Process

1. Click **"Proceed to Payment"**
2. Select **Payment Mode:**
   - **Net Banking:** Select your bank from dropdown
   - **Debit/Credit Card:** Enter card details
   - **UPI:** Enter VPA ID (Google Pay/PhonePe/Paytm)
   - **Paytm Wallet:** Use Paytm balance
3. Click **"Make Payment"**
4. You'll be redirected to the payment gateway
5. Complete the transaction
6. **Wait for confirmation page** (do NOT close browser/tab)
7. Note down **Transaction ID** and **Payment Date**
8. Return to NTA portal automatically

**Payment Confirmation:**
- You'll receive an email with payment confirmation
- SMS will be sent to registered mobile
- Transaction ID will be displayed on screen

**What if Payment Fails?**
- **Don't panic.** You can retry payment multiple times before the deadline
- Wait 30 minutes before retrying (to avoid double charges)
- Try a different payment mode (Net Banking if card failed, or vice versa)
- Check bank account to ensure money wasn't deducted
- If deducted but not reflecting in NTA portal, wait 24 hours for reconciliation
- Contact NTA helpdesk with Transaction ID if issue persists beyond 48 hours

---

### Step 10: Download and Print Confirmation Page

After successful payment:

1. **Confirmation Page** will be displayed on screen
2. Click **"Download Confirmation Page"**
3. A PDF file will be downloaded to your computer
4. **Print at least 3 copies:**
   - 1 for your records (keep in a safe folder)
   - 1 for your parents/guardian
   - 1 as backup (in case of misplacement)
5. **Save PDF** in multiple locations:
   - Computer hard drive
   - Google Drive / OneDrive
   - Email to yourself
   - USB drive / pen drive

**What's on the Confirmation Page?**
- Your Application Number
- Candidate's Name and Photo
- Date of Birth
- Category
- Exam City Preferences
- Payment details (Transaction ID, Date, Amount)
- Declaration and signature

**Important:** This is NOT your admit card. Your admit card will be available for download in mid-April 2026 (approx. 15 days before exam).

---

## Correction Window: March 10-12, 2026

1. Name (with supporting documents)
2. Date of Birth (with supporting documents)
3. Category (with supporting documents)
4. Gender
5. Parent's Names
6. Nationality
7. Identification Marks
8. Address details

### What CANNOT Be Corrected?

- **Email ID and Mobile Number** (you can only add alternative, not change primary)

### How to Make Corrections?

1. Log in to NEET portal with Application Number and Password
2. Click **"Correction Window"** link (active only Mar 10-12)
3. Select the fields you want to correct
4. Upload supporting documents if required (e.g., affidavit for name change)

6. Submit and download revised confirmation page

**Deadline:** Correction window closes on March 12, 2026 at 11:50 PM. NO extensions.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Name Mismatches (30% of Rejections)

**Mistake:** Name on application doesn't match Aadhaar/Class 10 certificate.

**Example:**
- Aadhaar: "Kumar Sharma"
- Class 10: "Ajay Kumar Sharma"
- Application: "A K Sharma"

**Result:** eKYC fails, application rejected or held for manual verification.

**Solution:**
- Use **exact name** as per Class 10 mark sheet
- If Aadhaar name is different, get Aadhaar updated first OR provide name-matching affidavit during correction window
- No titles (Mr., Ms., Dr., Kumari, Shri)
- No extra spaces or special characters

---

### 2. Category Certificate Issues (15% of Problems)

**Mistake:** Using an outdated or invalid category certificate.

**Requirements:**
- **OBC-NCL:** Valid for Financial Year 2025-26 (issued after April 1, 2025)
- **EWS:** Valid for FY 2025-26 (income less than ₹8 lakh)
- **SC/ST:** Lifetime valid, but must be from correct state
- **PwD:** Minimum 40% disability, issued by authorized medical board

**Solution:** Get fresh certificates issued after April 1, 2025 for income-based categories.

---

### 3. Blurry or Unclear Photo/Signature (20% Upload Failures)

**Mistake:** Photo taken in poor lighting, signature too light, or documents with dark backgrounds.

**Impact:** Application goes to manual verification queue, causing delays.

**Solution:**
- Take photo in **natural daylight** with white wall behind you
- Sign with **BLACK gel pen** on white paper (NO blue ink)
- Scan at **300 DPI** minimum resolution
- Save as **JPG** format with proper compression

---

### 4. Wrong Date of Birth Format (10% Errors)

**Mistake:** Entering date as MM-DD-YYYY (US format) instead of DD-MM-YYYY (Indian format).

**Example:**
- Correct: 15-08-2007 (15th August 2007)
- Wrong: 08-15-2007 (will be read as 8th-15th-2007, invalid)

**Impact:** eKYC fails, age eligibility issues.

**Solution:** Always use **DD-MM-YYYY** format and verify carefully before submitting.

---

### 5. Incorrect Email ID (5% Communication Failures)

**Mistake:** Typo in email address (e.g., `gmail` as `gmai`, `.com` as `.con`).

**Impact:** You won't receive OTPs, confirmation emails, or admit card notification.

**Solution:**
- Double-check email spelling
- Use a simple, frequently-checked email ID
- Test by sending yourself an email before entering

---

### 6. Mobile Number Not Linked to Aadhaar (25% eKYC Failures)

**Mistake:** Using a mobile number that's not registered with your Aadhaar card.

**Impact:** You won't receive Aadhaar OTP, eKYC fails completely.

**Solution:**
- Before applying, verify your Aadhaar-linked mobile by visiting [uidai.gov.in](https://uidai.gov.in)
- If not linked, visit nearest Aadhaar center to link (takes 1-2 days)
- Use THAT mobile number in NEET registration

---

### 7. Last-Minute Rush (Server Overload)

**Mistake:** Waiting until March 7-8 to register.

**Impact:** Server slow/down, payment gateway errors, unable to complete in time.

**Solution:**
- Register between **February 15-28** (optimal window)
- Avoid first 3 days (Feb 8-10) and last 2 days (Mar 7-8)
- Best time: **Weekdays between 11 AM - 3 PM**

---

### 8. Not Saving Confirmation Page

**Mistake:** Completing registration but not downloading/printing confirmation page.

**Impact:** No proof of registration if portal has issues later.

**Solution:**
- Download PDF immediately after payment
- Take screenshot of confirmation page
- Email PDF to yourself
- Print and keep in NEET folder

---

## Final Thoughts

NEET 2026 registration is a **straightforward process if you prepare well.** The key is having all documents ready, understanding each step, and not rushing at the last minute. Remember these golden rules:

1. **Register between Feb 15-28** (avoid rush periods)
2. **Verify every field** before payment
3. **Save confirmation page** in multiple locations
4. **Don't panic** if you make a mistake (correction window available)
5. **Start serious preparation** immediately after registration

With 84 days remaining after registration closes (March 8 to May 3), every single day counts. Make a study schedule, follow NCERT religiously, practice mock tests weekly, and stay consistent.

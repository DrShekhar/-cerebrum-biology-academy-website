### Mistake Log Template

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

| Date  | Question | Topic          | Mistake Type  | Correct Approach             | Revised? |
| ----- | -------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| Feb 5 | Q23      | Photosynthesis | Concept Gap   | C4 plants have Kranz anatomy | ✅       |
| Feb 5 | Q47      | Optics         | Silly Mistake | Forgot to convert cm to m    | ✅       |
| Feb 8 | Q12      | Organic        | Speed Issue   | Took 90 sec for conversion   | ⚠️       |

**Goal:** Each mistake should appear ONLY ONCE. If repeated, it's a serious issue.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid (5-Month Prep)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Neglecting NCERT for "Advanced" Books

**Reality:**

> 95% of NEET questions are directly from NCERT or NCERT-based.

**Fix:** Complete NCERT 6-8 times. Other books only for practice.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Taking Too Few Mock Tests

**Reality:**

> Toppers take 60-80 mocks. Average students take 20-30.

**Fix:** Minimum 65 full-length mocks in 5 months.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Mental Health

**Reality:**

> Burnout in April means 50-100 marks lost in exam.

**Fix:** 1 full day off every week. Non-negotiable.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Studying New Topics in May

**Reality:**

> May is for revision and confidence building, not new learning.

**Fix:** Stop new topics by April 30th. Only revise in May.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Analyzing Mock Tests

**Reality:**

> Taking mocks without analysis is like practicing cricket without a coach.

**Fix:** Spend 2-3 hours analyzing EVERY mock test.

## Motivation & Mindset

### The 650+ Mindset Checklist

✅ **I believe NEET is doable** - It's not IQ, it's strategy
✅ **I trust NCERT more than any other book** - 95% questions source
✅ **I analyze every mock test** - Mistakes are my teachers
✅ **I prioritize Biology** - 360 marks = 50% of total
✅ **I take care of my mental health** - Burnout is my biggest enemy
✅ **I sleep 8 hours in May** - Exam performance depends on rest
✅ **I will not give up** - Every hour of prep counts

### What to Do When You Feel Overwhelmed

**Feeling: "5 months is too less, I can't finish"**

**Reality Check:**

- NEET syllabus = 97 chapters total
- 5 months = 150 days
- 97 chapters ÷ 150 days = **less than 1 chapter per day**
- You CAN do this!

**Action:**

1. Break syllabus into weekly targets
2. Focus on today only (not the full 5 months)
3. Trust the process

**Feeling: "I'm scoring 450, how will I reach 650?"**

**Reality Check:**

- +200 marks in 5 months = +40 marks per month
- +40 marks = just 10 more correct questions per month
- 10 questions = fixing 2-3 weak topics

**Action:**

1. Identify your top 10 weak topics
2. Master 2 topics per week
3. Track improvement every mock test

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Is 5 months enough for NEET preparation?

**A:** Absolutely! If you have basic knowledge and are willing to study 8-10 hours daily in a structured way. Our 247 AIIMS selections in 2024 included many students who started seriously only in January.

### Q2: Should I focus more on Biology or Physics in these 5 months?

**A:** Biology (45% time), Physics (30%), Chemistry (25%). Biology is 50% of NEET and most scoring.

### Q3: How many mock tests should I take?

**A:** Minimum 65 full-length tests. Ideal: 80-100 tests. Daily mocks from April onwards.

### Q4: Can a dropper/repeater score better in second attempt?

**A:** Yes! Our data shows droppers score **+120 marks average** in second attempt if they follow a structured plan. Sadhna (695/720) was a dropper.

### Q5: How many times should I revise NCERT?

**A:** Minimum 6-8 times. Toppers do 10-12 revisions. Each revision gets faster (1st = 30 days, 8th = 2 days).

### Q6: What if I'm weak in Physics?

**A:** Focus on easy topics first (Modern Physics, Optics, Current). Skip complex mechanics problems. Target 120-140/180 in Physics, compensate with Biology 340+.

### Q7: Should I take coaching or self-study?

**A:** Depends on your discipline. Coaching provides structure, doubt clearing, and peer pressure. Self-study works if you're disciplined. Hybrid (online classes) is best.

### Q8: What to do if I get sick or lose study days?

**A:** Build buffer days. Don't panic. Focus on high-weightage topics. Skip low-weightage chapters if needed.

## Final Words from Dr. Shekhar (AIIMS Alumnus)

Dear Future Doctor,

You're reading this because you have a dream. A dream to wear that white coat, to heal lives, to make your parents proud.

**The next 5 months will define your future.**

I've coached 150,000+ students over 14 years. I've seen average students become toppers. I've seen brilliant students fail because they lacked a plan.

**What separates them?**

It's not intelligence. It's not luck.

**It's following a structured plan daily without fail.**

This 5-month plan is exactly what our 247 AIIMS selections followed. It's data-backed, battle-tested, and PROVEN.

But here's the catch - **a plan works only if YOU work the plan.**

So here's my challenge to you:

✅ Print this plan
✅ Stick it on your wall
✅ Follow it religiously for 5 months
✅ Track your progress weekly
✅ Trust the process even when mock scores fluctuate

**On May 4th, 2026, when you sit for NEET:**

You'll be confident because you've taken 65+ mocks
You'll be fast because you've practiced daily
You'll be calm because you've revised NCERT 8+ times
You'll score 650+ because you TRUSTED the plan

**And on July 2026, when results come out:**

Your name will be in the list.
Your parents will cry tears of joy.
Your sacrifice will be worth it.

**See you at AIIMS.**

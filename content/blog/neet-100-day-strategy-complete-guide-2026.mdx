## Daily Non-Negotiables (All 100 Days)

These 5 things must happen EVERY day:

| # | Activity | Time | Purpose |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | NCERT Biology Reading | 1 hour | Foundation |
| 2 | PYQ Practice | 1 hour | Pattern recognition |
| 3 | Previous Day Revision | 30 min | Retention |
| 4 | 50-Question Mini Test | 1 hour | Exam practice |
| 5 | Error Notebook Update | 15 min | Learning from mistakes |

---

## Common Mistakes in 100-Day Preparation

### Mistake 1: Starting New Topics in Last 30 Days
**Wrong:** "Let me quickly cover Biotechnology"
**Right:** Focus only on revision and mock tests after Day 70

### Mistake 2: Skipping Mock Test Analysis
**Wrong:** Give mock → Check score → Move on
**Right:** Spend equal time on analysis as on the mock itself

### Mistake 3: Irregular Sleep Schedule
**Wrong:** Study till 2 AM, wake at 10 AM
**Right:** Fixed schedule - sleep by 11 PM, wake by 6 AM

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Weak Areas
**Wrong:** Only practicing strong subjects
**Right:** 60% time on weak areas, 40% maintaining strong areas

### Mistake 5: Too Many Resources
**Wrong:** NCERT + Allen + Aakash + YouTube + 5 apps
**Right:** NCERT + One test series + Previous year papers

---

## Score Progression Benchmark

Track your progress against these benchmarks:

| Day | Mock Score Target | Status |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Day 30 | 450-480 | Foundation complete |
| Day 45 | 480-510 | Revision starting |
| Day 60 | 510-540 | PYQs done |
| Day 75 | 540-570 | Mock practice ongoing |
| Day 85 | 560-590 | Peak preparation |
| Day 95 | 580-620 | Exam ready |

**If you're behind benchmark:** Increase study hours, focus more on weak areas
**If you're ahead:** Don't get overconfident, maintain consistency

---

## The Mental Game

### Handling Pressure in Last 100 Days

1. **Daily Affirmation:** "I am prepared, I will succeed"
2. **Break Management:** 10-minute break every 90 minutes
3. **Physical Activity:** 30 minutes walk/exercise daily
4. **Sleep Priority:** 7 hours minimum, non-negotiable
5. **Support System:** Talk to family/friends when stressed

### Dealing with Bad Mock Scores

- One bad mock doesn't define you
- Analyze what went wrong
- Adjust strategy, don't panic
- Remember: Mock scores typically improve by 50-100 marks in actual exam

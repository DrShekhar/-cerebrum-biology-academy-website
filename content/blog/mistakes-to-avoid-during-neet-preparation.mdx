# 10 Critical Mistakes to Avoid During NEET Preparation: A Parent and Student Guide

Every year, over 24 lakh students register for NEET. Roughly 10-12 lakh of them are genuinely hardworking. They wake up early. They attend coaching. They study late into the night. And yet, only a fraction of them achieve a score that gets them into a good medical college.

The painful truth? Most underperformers do not fail because of a lack of effort. They fail because of **avoidable strategic mistakes** -- mistakes in how they plan, how they study, and how their families support the process.

This guide is different from our other articles on common mistakes or exam-day errors. This one is written for the **entire family** -- student and parent together -- because NEET preparation is not a solo mission. The decisions parents make about coaching, the atmosphere at home, the pressure applied or relieved -- all of it directly impacts the final score on that OMR sheet.

If you are a student reading this, share it with your parents. If you are a parent reading this, discuss it with your child. These 10 mistakes are the ones we see destroying preparation year after year in our coaching experience, and every single one of them is preventable.

> **Note:** This article focuses on **strategic preparation mistakes** -- the wrong decisions made over weeks and months. If you are looking for exam-hall mistakes (misreading questions, OMR errors, calculation blunders), read our guide on [How to Avoid Silly Mistakes in the NEET Exam](/blog/how-to-avoid-silly-mistakes-neet-exam).

## Mistake 1: Joining Multiple Coaching Institutes Simultaneously

### The Mistake

The student is enrolled in two, sometimes three coaching centres at the same time. One for Biology, one for Physics, one online "just for backup." The parent believes more coaching means more learning. The schedule is packed from 6 AM to 10 PM with back-to-back classes and no room to breathe, let alone study independently.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Parents see NEET as a high-stakes competition and want to leave no stone unturned. They hear that a particular institute is "best for Physics" and another is "best for Biology." The logic seems sound: pick the best of each and combine them. Students go along because they do not want to argue or because they genuinely believe more input equals more output.

### The Real Cost

- **Fragmented learning.** Each institute follows a different teaching sequence, different terminology, and different problem-solving approaches. The student spends mental energy reconciling these differences instead of mastering concepts.
- **Zero self-study time.** If your entire day is spent travelling to classes and sitting in lectures, when do you actually solve problems on your own? When do you revise? NEET is cracked in self-study hours, not in classroom hours.
- **Burnout by month 4.** The human brain needs processing time. Constant input without consolidation leads to exhaustion, not expertise. We have seen students who are physically present in class but mentally absent because they are simply too tired.
- **Estimated marks lost: 80-120 marks** compared to a student with one focused coaching and sufficient self-study.

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Choose one coaching institute. Commit to it fully. Use your remaining time for self-study and problem-solving. If a specific subject needs extra help, find a single-subject tutor, not an entire second institute.

**Parents:** Resist the temptation to "hedge your bets" with multiple coachings. Ask yourself -- does my child have at least 4-5 hours of free self-study time daily? If the answer is no, something needs to go.

## Mistake 2: Skipping NCERT for Fancy Reference Books

### The Mistake

The student has Trueman's, Dinesh, Pradeep's, MTG, and three other books on the shelf. NCERT sits untouched in the corner, or has been read once and deemed "too basic." The preparation revolves entirely around reference books and coaching material.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Reference books feel more "serious." They are thicker, more detailed, and seem more competitive. Coaching institutes often recommend their own modules, which are essentially compiled from multiple references. Parents see the thick stack of books and feel reassured that preparation is thorough. NCERT, being thin and simple-looking, does not inspire the same confidence.

### The Real Cost

- **95% of NEET Biology questions are based on NCERT** -- not referenced from NCERT, but directly lifted from NCERT language, diagrams, and examples. When NTA sets a question, they verify the answer against NCERT. If your terminology does not match NCERT, you will second-guess yourself on questions you should answer in 15 seconds.
- **Reference books often contain errors** and conflicting information. Students waste time memorizing details that will never appear in NEET or, worse, memorize incorrect facts that lead to wrong answers.
- **Incomplete coverage.** A student with one thorough reading of NCERT has better exam readiness than a student with three half-read reference books.
- **Estimated marks lost: 40-80 marks** in Biology alone.

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Read NCERT Biology cover to cover at least 5-6 times. Underline every line. Note every diagram label, every example organism, every exception mentioned. Use one reference book per subject only for practice questions, not for theory.

**Parents:** Do not judge preparation by the number of books on the desk. Ask your child: "How many times have you completed NCERT?" That number matters more than how many reference books they own.

---

## Mistake 3: Starting Mock Tests Too Late

### The Mistake

The student decides they will start taking mock tests only after "completing the syllabus." The syllabus is never truly complete. Mock tests get pushed to the last 2 months, sometimes the last 2 weeks. The student walks into NEET having attempted fewer than 10 full-length mocks.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

It feels logical: learn first, test later. Students fear low scores on early mocks and want to wait until they are "ready." Parents reinforce this by saying, "Focus on studying first. Exams will come later." Nobody wants to face a mock score of 300 when the target is 650.

### The Real Cost

- **No exam temperament.** Sitting for 3 hours and 20 minutes, maintaining focus across 200 questions, managing time across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology -- this is a skill that must be practiced. It cannot be developed in 2 weeks.
- **Unknown weak areas.** Without mocks, students do not know which topics they have actually mastered and which they only think they have mastered. This leads to blind spots that surface on exam day.
- **Poor time management.** Students who do not practise mocks consistently spend too long on tough questions and run out of time for easy ones. This alone can cost 30-50 marks.
- **Estimated marks lost: 50-80 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Start topic-wise tests from month 2 of preparation. Start full-length mocks from month 3-4, even if you have covered only 40-50% of the syllabus. Your first mock score does not matter. What matters is the trend -- each mock should be higher than the last.

**Mock Test Timeline:**

| Preparation Phase | Mock Frequency | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Month 1-2 | Chapter-wise tests | Build basic testing habit |
| Month 3-6 | 1 full mock per month | Identify weak areas early |
| Month 7-9 | 1 full mock per week | Build stamina and strategy |
| Month 10-12 | 2-3 mocks per week | Peak performance training |

**Parents:** Encourage early mock tests even when scores are low. A score of 350 on a mock in month 4 is far more useful than a score of 350 on the actual NEET because there was no time to improve.

---

## Mistake 4: Studying Without a Structured Plan

### The Mistake

The student studies whatever they feel like on a given day. Monday might be Genetics because they enjoy it. Tuesday is also Genetics because they did not finish. Wednesday is a random Physics chapter because coaching covered it. There is no weekly plan, no monthly target, no tracking of what has been covered and what remains.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Planning feels like a waste of study time. Students want to "just start studying" rather than spend an hour making a schedule. Parents rarely ask about the plan -- they ask about hours studied. The coaching institute provides a class schedule, which feels like enough structure. But a class schedule is not a study plan.

### The Real Cost

- **Favourite-subject bias.** Without a plan, students gravitate toward subjects they enjoy and avoid the ones they find difficult. Biology lovers neglect Physics. Strong students in Physical Chemistry ignore Organic Chemistry.
- **No completion tracking.** When you do not track what you have covered, you have no idea how much is left. This leads to a panicked realization in the final months that entire chapters have not been touched.
- **Revision gaps.** Without scheduled revision, old topics fade from memory as new ones are learned. The syllabus feels never-ending because nothing is being retained.
- **Estimated marks lost: 40-60 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Create a weekly study plan every Sunday evening. List exactly which chapters and topics you will cover each day. Include revision slots for previously completed topics. Track completion with a simple checklist.

**A Simple Weekly Plan Template:**

| Day | Morning (2 hrs) | Afternoon (3 hrs) | Evening (2 hrs) | Night (1.5 hrs) |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Mon | Physics - Mechanics | Biology - Genetics | Chemistry - Organic | Revision - Previous week |
| Tue | Physics - Problems | Biology - NCERT Read | Chemistry - Problems | Mock analysis |
| Wed | Chemistry - Physical | Biology - Ecology | Physics - Revision | NCERT re-read |
| Thu | Full mock test | -- | Mock analysis | Error log update |
| Fri | Physics - Electrostatics | Biology - Physiology | Chemistry - Inorganic | Revision |
| Sat | Weak areas focus | Biology - PYQs | Chemistry - PYQs | Physics - PYQs |
| Sun | Planning + light revision | Leisure / rest | Light reading | Plan next week |

**Parents:** Ask your child to show you their weekly plan. Not to micromanage, but to help them stay accountable. If they cannot articulate what they are studying this week and why, they do not have a plan.

---

## Mistake 5: Ignoring Weak Subjects Completely

### The Mistake

The student is strong in Biology and Chemistry but weak in Physics. Instead of confronting Physics, they avoid it almost entirely. They spend 80% of their time on Biology and Chemistry, convincing themselves that strong scores in two subjects will compensate for a weak third. Physics gets maybe 3-4 hours per week.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Studying weak subjects is psychologically uncomfortable. A Biology student who scores 320/360 in Biology feels confident and motivated. The same student scoring 80/180 in Physics feels frustrated and demoralized. The brain naturally seeks activities that produce dopamine hits (high scores in strong subjects) and avoids activities that produce anxiety (low scores in weak subjects). Parents often do not notice this pattern because they see the child studying for long hours without realizing those hours are disproportionately allocated.

### The Real Cost

- **Diminishing returns in strong subjects.** Going from 320 to 340 in Biology requires enormous effort for 20 extra marks. Going from 80 to 130 in Physics requires moderate, focused effort for 50 extra marks. The weak subject offers a far better return on investment.
- **Negative marking amplification.** In a weak subject, students guess more often. Each wrong guess costs 5 marks (4 lost + 1 penalty). A student who guesses on 15 Physics questions could lose 25-30 marks from negative marking alone.
- **Score ceiling.** There is a hard mathematical ceiling. Even if you score 350 in Biology and 170 in Chemistry (both exceptional), your total is only 520 if Physics is 100. That is not enough for a government medical college seat.
- **Estimated marks lost: 50-100 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Allocate a fixed minimum of 1.5-2 hours daily to your weakest subject, non-negotiable. Start with the highest-weightage chapters in that subject. In Physics, that means Mechanics and Modern Physics. Do not aim for perfection in the weak subject -- aim for competence. Going from 80 to 130 is realistic and transforms your total score.

**Parents:** Ask your child which subject they are spending the least time on. That is almost certainly the subject with the highest improvement potential. Support them in facing it rather than running from it. If needed, invest in a subject-specific tutor for the weak area rather than adding another full coaching.

---

## Mistake 6: The Comparison Trap

### The Mistake

"Sharma ji ka beta scored 680 in his mock test." "Your cousin got into AIIMS last year, why can't you?" "The topper in your coaching class studies 16 hours a day." The parent constantly compares the student with toppers, relatives, neighbors, and classmates. The student internalizes this comparison and begins measuring their worth by how they stack up against others rather than by their own progress.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Parents compare because they genuinely believe it will motivate their child. In Indian culture, social comparison is deeply embedded. Relatives ask about NEET preparation at every family gathering. Parents feel the pressure too and unknowingly transfer it to the child. Students compare themselves because social media and coaching institute rank lists make it unavoidable.

### The Real Cost

- **Anxiety replaces focus.** When a student is constantly thinking about how others are performing, their mental bandwidth is consumed by anxiety rather than learning. Studies in educational psychology consistently show that **comparative anxiety reduces working memory capacity** -- the very cognitive resource needed for learning complex subjects.
- **Self-esteem erosion.** Every student has a different starting point, different strengths, and a different learning pace. Comparison ignores all of this. A student who improves from 350 to 500 has made extraordinary progress, but if they are being compared to someone scoring 650, they feel like a failure.
- **Paralysis and avoidance.** Severe comparison-driven anxiety can lead to procrastination, avoidance of study, and even depression. We have seen students stop attending coaching because they feel they "will never be as good as" someone else.
- **Estimated marks lost: 30-60 marks** (indirect, through reduced study effectiveness and increased anxiety).

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Compare yourself only to your past self. Keep a score tracker: your mock test scores over time. If the line is going up, you are winning. It does not matter where someone else's line is. Delete social media groups where rank comparisons happen daily.

**Parents:** This is primarily a parent fix. Stop comparing your child to anyone. Period. Instead of "Why can't you score like Rahul?", say "Your score went up by 30 marks this month -- that is real progress." Celebrate improvement, not rank. Shield your child from relative pressure at family gatherings. If a relative asks about NEET scores, respond with "She is working hard and improving" and change the subject.

## Mistake 7: Sacrificing Sleep and Health for More Study Hours

### The Mistake

The student sleeps 4-5 hours per night, sometimes less. They skip meals, avoid exercise, and sit at their desk for 14-16 hours. The parent encourages this by saying "This is just one year of sacrifice" or "Sleep after NEET is over." Physical health deteriorates. Dark circles become permanent. Concentration drops by afternoon, but the student pushes through anyway.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

There is a deeply ingrained cultural belief that more hours automatically means better results. Parents see the competitive landscape and feel that anything less than 14 hours of study means the child is not serious. Students fear that sleeping 7 hours means losing 2-3 hours to a competitor who sleeps only 5. Social media posts from "toppers" claiming to study 18 hours a day reinforce this destructive norm.

### The Real Cost

- **Sleep is when memory consolidates.** Neuroscience is unambiguous on this: the hippocampus transfers information from short-term to long-term memory during deep sleep cycles. A student who studies 10 hours and sleeps 7 hours retains more than a student who studies 14 hours and sleeps 4 hours. This is not an opinion. It is established neuroscience.
- **Cognitive decline after 6 hours of study.** After approximately 6 hours of focused study, the brain's ability to absorb and process new information drops sharply. The 12th, 13th, and 14th hours of study are producing a fraction of the learning that the 1st through 6th hours produced. Those extra hours feel productive but are largely wasted.
- **Health breakdown.** We see it every year: students falling sick in the final 2 months, developing severe headaches, experiencing burnout-induced depression. A student who is sick during the last month of preparation loses far more than they gained from those extra late-night hours.
- **Estimated marks lost: 40-70 marks** (through reduced retention, exam-day fatigue, and potential illness).

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Sleep 7 hours minimum. Not 6, not "I'll make up on weekends." Seven hours, every night. Study for 8-10 focused hours, not 14 unfocused hours. Include 30 minutes of physical activity daily -- even a brisk walk helps. Eat three proper meals. Your brain is an organ. It needs fuel and rest to function.

**Parents:** Do not glorify sleep deprivation. If your child is studying past midnight every night, that is not dedication. It is a sign of inefficient study habits or an overloaded schedule. Ensure meals are regular and nutritious. Protect sleep time the way you protect study time.

---

## Mistake 8: Not Revising Regularly

### The Mistake

The student is always learning new chapters. They finished Genetics two months ago but have not looked at it since. They completed Mechanics three months ago and cannot solve basic problems from it now. The approach is linear: start from Chapter 1, proceed to the end, and then panic-revise everything in the last month.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

New topics feel like progress. Revision feels like going backward. Students want the satisfaction of "completing the syllabus" and view revision as something to do after completion. Parents reinforce this by asking "How many chapters are left?" rather than "How well do you remember what you have already studied?"

### The Real Cost

- **The forgetting curve is real.** Hermann Ebbinghaus demonstrated that without revision, we forget approximately 70% of learned material within 7 days. If you studied a chapter in September and do not revise until March, you will need to relearn almost from scratch. That is not revision. That is repetition of the entire learning process.
- **Syllabus completion is meaningless without retention.** A student who has "completed" the entire syllabus but remembers only 50% of it is less prepared than a student who has covered 80% of the syllabus but retains 90% of it.
- **Last-month panic.** Without regular revision, the final month becomes a desperate race to re-learn everything. This is the single most common reason students feel "not ready" on exam day -- not because they did not study it, but because they did not revise it.
- **Estimated marks lost: 60-100 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Follow the 1-7-30 revision rule. Revise a topic 1 day after learning it, 7 days after that, and 30 days after that. Build revision into your weekly plan -- at least 30% of your study time should be revision, not new learning. Use flashcards, quick-recall tests, or teach-back methods to test retention.

**The 1-7-30 Revision Schedule:**

| Revision Round | When | Method | Time Required |
|----------------|------|--------|---------------|
| Round 1 | 1 day after learning | Re-read notes, solve 10 questions | 30-45 minutes |
| Round 2 | 7 days later | Solve 20 questions without notes, review errors | 45-60 minutes |
| Round 3 | 30 days later | Full chapter test (30 questions), identify gaps | 60-90 minutes |
| Round 4+ | Every 45-60 days | Quick recall test, focus only on weak points | 20-30 minutes |

**Parents:** Change your question from "How many new chapters did you cover?" to "Which topics did you revise this week?" Help your child understand that going back to old topics is not falling behind. It is building a foundation that lasts until exam day.

---

## Mistake 9: Passive Learning

### The Mistake

The student spends 4-5 hours watching video lectures, reads notes, and highlights textbook pages in five different colors. They feel productive. But they have not solved a single problem, attempted a single question, or tested themselves on anything. Their study method is purely passive: absorb, absorb, absorb, never output.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Passive learning is comfortable. Watching a well-made video lecture feels like learning. Reading highlighted notes feels like revision. There is no risk of failure, no frustration of getting a problem wrong, no confrontation with gaps in understanding. It is the illusion of productivity without the discomfort of actual learning. Parents see the child at their desk for hours and assume productive work is happening.

### The Real Cost

- **Recognition is not recall.** When you read a concept, your brain recognizes it -- "Yes, I have seen this before." But NEET does not test recognition. It tests **recall** -- can you retrieve this information from memory under time pressure, without any prompts? Recognition and recall are different cognitive processes, and only active practice builds recall.
- **Zero problem-solving skills.** NEET Physics and Chemistry questions require application of concepts, not just knowledge of them. A student who has watched 50 lectures on Mechanics but solved only 20 problems will score lower than a student who watched 10 lectures and solved 200 problems.
- **False confidence.** Passive learners consistently overestimate their preparedness. They walk into the exam believing they are ready and are shocked when they cannot answer questions they "knew" the answers to.
- **Estimated marks lost: 50-80 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Follow the 30-70 rule. Spend 30% of your study time on input (reading, watching, listening) and 70% on output (solving problems, attempting questions, writing answers from memory, teaching concepts aloud). After every 30-minute reading session, close the book and solve 15-20 questions on that topic without looking at the material.

**The Active Learning Test:** After studying a topic, close all materials and write down everything you remember on a blank sheet. If you cannot fill at least half a page from memory, you did not learn it -- you just read it.

**Parents:** Ask your child to explain a concept they studied today. If they can explain it clearly without their notes, they have learned actively. If they say "I read it but I cannot explain it right now," they are studying passively, and the method needs to change.

---

## Mistake 10: Not Seeking Help When Stuck

### The Mistake

The student is stuck on a concept. They do not understand Electrochemistry. They have read the chapter twice and watched three videos, but it still does not make sense. Instead of asking a teacher, a mentor, or even a peer for help, they either (a) skip the chapter entirely, or (b) spend 4-5 days struggling alone, trying to figure it out from YouTube videos, losing valuable time and building frustration.

### Why Students and Parents Make It

Students hesitate to ask for help because they fear being judged. "What if the teacher thinks I'm stupid?" "What if my classmates laugh?" In large coaching batches of 100+ students, asking a doubt after class feels intimidating. Some students have been discouraged by dismissive teachers in the past. Parents often do not know their child is stuck because the child does not communicate it. There is also a cultural dimension: asking for help is sometimes perceived as weakness rather than wisdom.

### The Real Cost

- **Time wastage.** A concept that a good teacher can explain in 20 minutes takes a struggling student 4-5 days of confused self-study. That is 15-20 hours wasted -- enough time to complete an entire chapter.
- **Cascading confusion.** In subjects like Physics and Chemistry, concepts build on each other. If you do not understand Chemical Bonding, you will struggle with Molecular Structure, which means you will struggle with Organic Chemistry. One unresolved doubt snowballs into an entire weak subject.
- **Chapter avoidance.** Topics that cause confusion often get permanently skipped. A student who "does not understand" Ray Optics will avoid it entirely, losing 8-10 guaranteed questions in the exam.
- **Estimated marks lost: 30-50 marks.**

### How to Fix It

**Students:** Establish a rule: if you do not understand a concept within 2 hours of self-study, ask for help. Not 2 days. Two hours. Keep a doubt register -- write down questions as they arise and get them resolved within 48 hours. If your coaching class is too large to ask doubts, approach the teacher after class, message a senior, or find a mentor specifically for doubt resolution.

**Parents:** Create an environment where asking for help is celebrated, not stigmatized. Ask your child daily: "Was there anything confusing today? Do you need help with anything?" If the coaching institute does not provide adequate doubt resolution, that is a red flag worth addressing. A good coaching should make it easy for students to ask questions.

## What Your Child Needs From You: A Guide for Parents

NEET preparation is often framed as the student's journey. But the family environment is the invisible factor that either accelerates or sabotages that journey. Based on our years of working with NEET families, here is a clear breakdown of what helps and what harms.

### 5 Things Parents Should Do

| Action | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Provide a quiet, dedicated study space** | Consistent environment reduces distraction and builds study habits. A student who studies in the living room with the TV on will always underperform. |
| **Maintain open, non-judgmental communication** | Your child needs to tell you when they are struggling. If they fear your reaction, they will hide problems until it is too late. Check in daily without interrogating. |
| **Attend parent-teacher meetings and track progress** | You do not need to understand Physics. You need to understand whether your child is on track. Regular communication with the coaching institute gives you objective data. |
| **Protect their schedule from social obligations** | Family functions, relative visits, and social commitments consume preparation time. Be the shield. "She is preparing for NEET" is a complete sentence. |
| **Celebrate progress, not just results** | A jump from 400 to 480 in mock tests is outstanding progress. Celebrate it. If you only celebrate 650+, your child will feel that nothing short of perfection is valued. |

### 5 Things Parents Should Stop Doing

| Action | Why It Harms |
|--------|-------------|
| **Comparing your child to toppers, cousins, or neighbors** | Comparison creates anxiety, not motivation. Every student has a different starting point and learning pace. Your child's competitor is their past self, not Sharma ji ka beta. |
| **Monitoring study hours instead of study quality** | A student who studies 6 focused hours outperforms one who sits at a desk for 12 hours with a phone hidden in a drawer. Focus on what they are learning, not how long they sit. |
| **Making all conversations about NEET** | Your child is a human being, not a NEET-answering machine. If every dinner conversation, every car ride, every phone call revolves around "How was your test?" and "Did you study today?", the child feels suffocated. Talk about other things. Let them breathe. |
| **Threatening consequences for low scores** | "If you don't get 600, we're cutting your phone / not paying for college / telling relatives you failed." Fear-based motivation works for about 2 weeks and then causes shutdown, rebellion, or depression. |
| **Changing coaching institutes mid-preparation** | Switching coaching in month 6 or 8 because scores are not improving fast enough is almost always counterproductive. The new institute has a different syllabus sequence, different teaching style, and the student loses 3-4 weeks just adjusting. Stability beats chasing the "best" institute. |

## The Cost-Benefit Table: What Each Mistake Costs You

Here is a consolidated view of how each strategic mistake translates into marks lost on exam day. These are estimates based on patterns we have observed across thousands of students over multiple NEET cycles.

| Mistake | Estimated Marks Lost | Primary Cause of Loss |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1. Multiple coaching institutes | 80-120 marks | No self-study time, fragmented concepts |
| 2. Skipping NCERT | 40-80 marks | Wrong terminology, missed direct questions |
| 3. Late mock tests | 50-80 marks | Poor time management, unknown weak areas |
| 4. No structured plan | 40-60 marks | Uneven coverage, no revision schedule |
| 5. Ignoring weak subjects | 50-100 marks | Low score floor, excessive negative marking |
| 6. Comparison trap | 30-60 marks | Anxiety reducing study effectiveness |
| 7. Sleep and health sacrifice | 40-70 marks | Poor retention, exam-day fatigue |
| 8. No regular revision | 60-100 marks | Forgetting previously learned material |
| 9. Passive learning | 50-80 marks | False confidence, no recall ability |
| 10. Not seeking help | 30-50 marks | Skipped topics, cascading confusion |

**A student making even 3-4 of these mistakes simultaneously can lose 150-250 marks.** That is the difference between AIIMS and no medical seat at all.

The encouraging part? Every single mistake on this list is fixable. Not one of them requires more intelligence, more money, or more talent. They require **better decisions** -- and those decisions start today.

---

## The Path Forward

Read through this list again. Be honest with yourself. How many of these mistakes are you currently making? If the answer is more than two, do not panic. Awareness is the first step. The second step is action.

Pick the two mistakes that resonate most with your situation and fix them this week. Not next month. This week. If you are a parent, sit down with your child tonight and discuss this article together. Identify which mistakes apply to your family and make a concrete plan to address them.

NEET preparation is a marathon. The students who succeed are not the ones who study the most hours or attend the most coaching classes. They are the ones who make the fewest strategic mistakes, follow a structured plan, and have a supportive family environment backing them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is 6 months really enough for NEET?

Yes, for 550-650 score. Many droppers and late starters have cracked NEET in 6 months with focused preparation. However, expecting 700+ in 6 months requires exceptional dedication.

### How many hours should I study daily?

Minimum 10-12 hours of focused study. Quality matters more than quantity, but 6 months doesn't give you the luxury of studying less.

Not necessary if you're disciplined. Use online resources and self-study. Coaching can help with doubt resolution and mock tests.

Biology first (50% marks, more NCERT-dependent), then Chemistry (especially Organic), then Physics. But never neglect any subject completely.

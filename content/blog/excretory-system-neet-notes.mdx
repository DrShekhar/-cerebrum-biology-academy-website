Excretion is an important chapter in Human Physiology, contributing **3-5 questions** in NEET annually. This comprehensive guide covers all NCERT concepts for NEET 2026.

## Introduction to Excretion

**Definition:** Removal of metabolic waste products from the body.

### Types of Nitrogenous Waste

| Waste Product | Source                      | Animals                  | Toxicity  | Water Requirement |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| Ammonia       | Protein metabolism          | Aquatic animals          | Very high | Very high         |
| Urea          | Ammonia conversion in liver | Mammals, amphibians      | Moderate  | Moderate          |
| Uric acid     | Purine metabolism           | Birds, reptiles, insects | Low       | Very low          |

### Classification Based on Excretion

| Type        | Waste Product | Examples                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ammonotelic | Ammonia       | Fish, aquatic invertebrates |

## Human Excretory System

### Components

1. **Kidneys (2)** - Main excretory organs
2. **Ureters (2)** - Transport urine to bladder
3. **Urinary bladder (1)** - Stores urine
4. **Urethra (1)** - Expels urine from body

### Kidney - Structure

**Location:** Retroperitoneal, between T12-L3 vertebrae

**Size:** ~11 cm × 6 cm × 3 cm, ~150 g each

**External Structure:**

- Bean-shaped
- Hilum: Concave side where renal artery, vein, and ureter connect

## Urine Formation

### Three Processes

1. **Glomerular Filtration**
2. **Tubular Reabsorption**
3. **Tubular Secretion**

### 1. Glomerular Filtration

**Process:** Blood filtered through glomerular capillaries into Bowman's capsule

**Filtration Membrane (3 layers):**

1. Endothelium of glomerular capillaries (fenestrated)
2. Basement membrane
3. Podocytes of Bowman's capsule (filtration slits)

**What Gets Filtered:**

- Water
- Salts
- Glucose
- Amino acids
- Urea
- Creatinine

**What is NOT Filtered:**

- Blood cells
- Plasma proteins
- Large molecules

**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):**

- ~125 mL/min
- ~180 L/day
- Only ~1.5 L excreted as urine (99% reabsorbed)

**Net Filtration Pressure (NFP):**
NFP = Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure - (Capsular Pressure + Colloidal Osmotic Pressure)
NFP = 55 - (15 + 30) = 10 mm Hg

### 2. Tubular Reabsorption

**Location and Substances Reabsorbed:**

| Segment         | Substances Reabsorbed                                           | Mechanism                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| PCT             | 70-80% water, all glucose, all amino acids, Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺, HCO₃⁻ | Active and passive             |
| Descending LoH  | Water                                                           | Osmosis                        |
| Ascending LoH   | Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺                                                    | Active (thick), Passive (thin) |
| DCT             | Na⁺, Ca²⁺, water (regulated)                                    | Active, hormone-dependent      |
| Collecting Duct | Water, urea                                                     | ADH-dependent                  |

**NEET Important:**

- PCT reabsorbs all glucose and amino acids (100%)
- Thick ascending limb is impermeable to water
- DCT and collecting duct are regulated by hormones

### 3. Tubular Secretion

**Process:** Active transport of substances from blood into tubular fluid

| Substance     | Location             | Significance      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| H⁺ ions       | PCT, DCT             | Acid-base balance |
| K⁺ ions       | DCT, Collecting duct | K⁺ regulation     |
| Creatinine    | PCT                  | Waste removal     |
| Drugs, toxins | PCT                  | Detoxification    |

## Countercurrent Mechanism

### Purpose

Creates osmotic gradient in medulla for urine concentration.

### How It Works

**Loop of Henle:**

1. Descending limb: Permeable to water, impermeable to solutes
2. Ascending limb: Impermeable to water, actively pumps out NaCl
3. Creates increasing osmolarity from cortex to medulla (300 → 1200 mOsm/L)

**Vasa Recta:**

- Hairpin loop of blood vessels
- Maintains gradient by countercurrent exchange
- Prevents "washing out" of medullary gradient

**Result:** Urine can be concentrated up to 4× plasma concentration

## Regulation of Kidney Function

### Hormonal Regulation

#### 1. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH/Vasopressin)

| Factor         | ADH Level | Effect on DCT/CD     | Urine Volume | Urine Concentration |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Dehydration    | ↑         | ↑ Water reabsorption | ↓            | ↑ (concentrated)    |
| Over-hydration | ↓         | ↓ Water reabsorption | ↑            | ↓ (dilute)          |

**Source:** Hypothalamus (made), Posterior pituitary (released)

#### 2. Aldosterone

| Factor          | Aldosterone | Effect                             | Result               |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Low Na⁺/High K⁺ | ↑           | ↑ Na⁺ reabsorption, ↑ K⁺ secretion | ↑ Blood volume, ↓ K⁺ |
| High Na⁺/Low K⁺ | ↓           | Opposite                           | ↓ Blood volume       |

**Source:** Adrenal cortex

#### 3. Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)

- Released by atria when stretched (high blood volume)
- ↓ Na⁺ reabsorption → ↑ Na⁺ and water excretion
- Decreases blood pressure

### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

**Trigger:** Low blood pressure/volume detected by JGA

**Pathway:**

1. Kidney releases Renin
2. Renin converts Angiotensinogen → Angiotensin I
3. ACE (in lungs) converts Angiotensin I → Angiotensin II
4. Angiotensin II:
   - Vasoconstriction (↑ BP)
   - Stimulates aldosterone release
   - Stimulates ADH release
   - Stimulates thirst

### Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA)

**Location:** Where DCT contacts afferent arteriole

**Components:**

1. **Juxtaglomerular cells:** In afferent arteriole, secrete renin
2. **Macula densa:** In DCT, sense Na⁺ concentration

## Micturition (Urination)

### Neural Control

1. Bladder fills → Stretch receptors activated
2. Signals to micturition center (sacral spinal cord)
3. Parasympathetic stimulation → Detrusor muscle contracts
4. Internal sphincter relaxes (involuntary)
5. External sphincter relaxes (voluntary)
6. Urine expelled

**Volume for urge:** ~300 mL
**Maximum capacity:** ~700-800 mL

## FAQs

**Q: Why do we produce more urine in winter than summer?**
A: In winter, we sweat less due to lower temperatures. To maintain water balance, excess water is excreted through kidneys. Also, cold causes peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing blood flow to kidneys.

**Q: How does diabetes mellitus cause glycosuria?**
A: In diabetes, blood glucose levels exceed the renal threshold (~180 mg/dL). The PCT cannot reabsorb all glucose, so excess glucose appears in urine.

**Q: Why is the ascending limb of loop of Henle impermeable to water?**
A: This is crucial for the countercurrent mechanism. The thick ascending limb actively pumps out NaCl without water following, creating the osmotic gradient in the medulla needed for urine concentration.

**Q: What happens if both kidneys fail?**
A: Complete kidney failure leads to uremia (toxic waste accumulation), electrolyte imbalance, and death without treatment. Hemodialysis or kidney transplant is required for survival.

**Q: Why is the loop of Henle longer in juxtamedullary nephrons?**
A: Longer loops extend deeper into the medulla, creating a steeper osmotic gradient. This allows for greater urine concentration, important for water conservation.

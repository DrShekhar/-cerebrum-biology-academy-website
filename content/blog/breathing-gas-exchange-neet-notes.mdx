## Respiratory System

### Respiratory Organs in Different Animals

| Animal Group | Respiratory Organ |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Earthworm | Moist skin |
| Insects | Tracheal system |
| Fish | Gills |
| Amphibians | Skin, gills, lungs |
| Reptiles, Birds, Mammals | Lungs |

### Human Respiratory System

**Components:**
1. **Conducting portion:** Nose → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchi → Bronchioles (up to terminal bronchioles)
2. **Respiratory portion:** Respiratory bronchioles → Alveolar ducts → Alveoli

### Upper Respiratory Tract

**Nose:**
- External nares (nostrils)
- Nasal cavity lined with mucous membrane
- Functions: Filtering, warming, humidifying air

**Pharynx:**
- Common passage for air and food
- Three parts: Nasopharynx, Oropharynx, Laryngopharynx

**Larynx (Voice Box):**
- Contains vocal cords
- Cartilages: Thyroid (Adam's apple), Cricoid, Arytenoid, Epiglottis
- Glottis: Opening between vocal cords

### Lower Respiratory Tract

**Trachea (Windpipe):**
- ~10-12 cm long
- C-shaped cartilaginous rings (open posteriorly)
- Lined with ciliated epithelium and goblet cells

**Bronchi:**
- Trachea divides into right and left primary bronchi
- Right bronchus: Wider, shorter, more vertical (foreign objects lodge here)
- Secondary and tertiary bronchi within lungs

**Bronchioles:**
- Lack cartilage
- Smooth muscle for diameter regulation
- Terminal bronchioles: End of conducting zone

**Alveoli:**
- ~300 million per lung
- Site of gas exchange
- Covered by pulmonary capillaries
- Surfactant reduces surface tension

### Lungs

| Feature | Right Lung | Left Lung |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Lobes | 3 | 2 |
| Fissures | 2 | 1 |
| Weight | ~600 g | ~550 g |

**Pleura:**
- Double membrane covering lungs
- Parietal pleura: Lines thoracic cavity
- Visceral pleura: Covers lungs
- Pleural cavity: Contains pleural fluid (reduces friction)

## Mechanism of Breathing

### Breathing Muscles

| Muscle | Inspiration | Expiration |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Diaphragm | Contracts (flattens) | Relaxes (dome shape) |
| External intercostals | Contract | Relax |
| Internal intercostals | Relax | Contract (forced) |
| Abdominal muscles | Relax | Contract (forced) |

### Inspiration (Active Process)

1. Diaphragm contracts and flattens
2. External intercostals contract, ribs move up and out
3. Thoracic cavity volume increases
4. Intrapulmonary pressure decreases (below atmospheric)
5. Air rushes into lungs

### Expiration (Passive Process - at rest)

1. Diaphragm and intercostals relax
2. Thoracic cavity volume decreases
3. Intrapulmonary pressure increases (above atmospheric)
4. Air pushed out of lungs

**Forced Expiration:** Internal intercostals and abdominal muscles contract

### Pressure Changes

| Location | Inspiration | Expiration |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Intrapleural | -6 mm Hg | -3 mm Hg |
| Intrapulmonary | -1 mm Hg | +1 mm Hg |

## Lung Volumes and Capacities

### Lung Volumes

| Volume | Definition | Average (mL) |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Tidal Volume (TV) | Air in normal breathing | 500 |
| Inspiratory Reserve (IRV) | Extra air on forced inspiration | 3000 |
| Expiratory Reserve (ERV) | Extra air on forced expiration | 1100 |
| Residual Volume (RV) | Air remaining after forced expiration | 1200 |

### Lung Capacities

| Capacity | Formula | Average (mL) |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Inspiratory Capacity (IC) | TV + IRV | 3500 |
| Expiratory Capacity (EC) | TV + ERV | 1600 |
| Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) | ERV + RV | 2300 |
| Vital Capacity (VC) | TV + IRV + ERV | 4600 |
| Total Lung Capacity (TLC) | VC + RV | 5800 |

**NEET Important:**
- **Vital Capacity:** Maximum air that can be exhaled after maximum inhalation
- **Residual Volume:** Prevents lung collapse, allows continuous gas exchange

## Exchange of Gases

### Composition of Atmospheric Air

| Gas | Percentage |
|-----|------------|
| Nitrogen | 78% |
| Oxygen | 21% |
| Carbon dioxide | 0.04% |
| Others | ~1% |

### Partial Pressures (at sea level)

| Gas | Atmospheric (mm Hg) | Alveolar (mm Hg) |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|
| pO₂ | 159 | 104 |
| pCO₂ | 0.3 | 40 |
| pH₂O | variable | 47 |
| pN₂ | 597 | 569 |

### Gas Exchange at Alveoli

**Factors affecting diffusion:**
1. Pressure gradient (most important)
2. Solubility of gas
3. Thickness of membrane
4. Surface area

**Respiratory membrane (0.2 μm thick):**
1. Alveolar epithelium (Type I pneumocytes)
2. Epithelial basement membrane
3. Interstitial space
4. Capillary basement membrane
5. Capillary endothelium

| Gas | Direction | Pressure Gradient |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| O₂ | Alveoli → Blood | 104 - 40 = 64 mm Hg |
| CO₂ | Blood → Alveoli | 45 - 40 = 5 mm Hg |

**Note:** CO₂ diffuses 20× faster than O₂ despite lower gradient (higher solubility)

## Transport of Gases

### Oxygen Transport

**1. Dissolved in Plasma (3%)**
- pO₂ determines dissolved oxygen
- ~0.3 mL O₂/100 mL blood

**2. Bound to Hemoglobin (97%)**
- Hemoglobin: 4 heme groups + 4 polypeptide chains
- Each Hb binds 4 O₂ molecules
- Hb + O₂ ⇌ HbO₂ (Oxyhemoglobin)

**Oxygen Carrying Capacity:**
- 1 g Hb binds 1.34 mL O₂
- Normal Hb: 15 g/100 mL blood
- Max O₂: ~20 mL/100 mL blood

### Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve

**Shape:** Sigmoidal (S-shaped)

**Explanation:** Cooperative binding - binding of first O₂ increases affinity for subsequent O₂

**Important Values:**

| pO₂ (mm Hg) | % Saturation | Location |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| 104 | 97-98% | Lungs |
| 40 | 75% | Tissues (resting) |
| 20 | 35% | Active tissues |

### Factors Shifting the Curve

| Factor | Effect | Shift | Result |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| ↑ pCO₂ | Bohr effect | Right | ↓ O₂ affinity |
| ↑ H⁺ (↓ pH) | Bohr effect | Right | ↓ O₂ affinity |
| ↑ Temperature | - | Right | ↓ O₂ affinity |
| ↑ 2,3-DPG | - | Right | ↓ O₂ affinity |

**NEET Tip:** Right shift = releases O₂ more easily (beneficial in active tissues)

### Carbon Dioxide Transport

| Method | Percentage | Form |
|--------|------------|------|
| Dissolved in plasma | 7% | CO₂ |
| As carbaminohemoglobin | 23% | HbCO₂ |
| As bicarbonate | 70% | HCO₃⁻ |

### Bicarbonate Formation (Chloride Shift)

**In Tissues:**
1. CO₂ diffuses into RBC
2. CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ (carbonic anhydrase)
3. H₂CO₃ → H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
4. HCO₃⁻ moves out, Cl⁻ moves in (chloride shift)
5. H⁺ buffered by hemoglobin

**In Lungs:** Reverse process occurs

### Haldane Effect

- Binding of O₂ to Hb reduces its affinity for CO₂
- In lungs: High O₂ → CO₂ released
- In tissues: Low O₂ → CO₂ binds easily

## Regulation of Respiration

### Respiratory Center

**Location:** Medulla oblongata and pons

| Center | Location | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Respiratory rhythm center | Medulla | Basic breathing rhythm |
| Pneumotaxic center | Pons | Limits inspiration duration |
| Apneustic center | Lower pons | Prolongs inspiration |

### Chemical Regulation

| Factor | Receptors | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| ↑ pCO₂ | Central (medulla) | ↑ Ventilation |
| ↓ pO₂ | Peripheral (carotid, aortic bodies) | ↑ Ventilation |
| ↓ pH | Central and peripheral | ↑ Ventilation |

**NEET Important:** CO₂ is the primary chemical regulator of breathing, not O₂.

## FAQs

**Q: Why is the oxygen-hemoglobin curve sigmoidal?**
A: Due to cooperative binding. When one O₂ binds, hemoglobin changes shape making it easier for subsequent O₂ molecules to bind. This creates the characteristic S-shape.

**Q: Why is CO₂ the primary regulator of breathing, not O₂?**
A: Central chemoreceptors in the medulla are highly sensitive to CO₂/H⁺ changes. O₂ levels must drop significantly before peripheral chemoreceptors respond. Normal breathing maintains CO₂ levels, which indirectly maintains O₂.

**Q: What is the significance of residual volume?**
A: Residual volume prevents lung collapse (atelectasis) and ensures continuous gas exchange even between breaths. Without it, alveoli would collapse during expiration.

**Q: Why do we breathe faster during exercise?**
A: Exercise increases CO₂ production and H⁺ levels. These stimulate chemoreceptors, which signal the respiratory center to increase breathing rate and depth.

**Q: How does smoking affect the respiratory system?**
A: Smoking destroys cilia (impairs mucus clearance), causes chronic inflammation, destroys alveolar walls (emphysema), and increases risk of lung cancer. It also produces carboxyhemoglobin, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity.

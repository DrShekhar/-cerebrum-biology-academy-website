## Introduction: Why Genetics & Molecular Biology is a NEET Gold Mine

If Human Physiology is the **highest-scoring chapter** in NEET Biology, **Genetics & Molecular Biology is the second-highest**. Together, these two units alone can get you **80-100 marks** in Biology.

### NEET Weightage Data (2020-2026)

| Topic Area | Typical Questions | Marks Range | Difficulty |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Molecular Basis of Inheritance** | 4-6 questions | 16-24 marks | Medium-High |
| **Principles of Inheritance & Variation** | 4-6 questions | 16-24 marks | Medium |
| **TOTAL** | **8-12 questions** | **32-48 marks** | **High ROI** |

**Key insight**: Unlike other chapters where questions are factual recall, Genetics has **problem-solving questions** (Punnett squares, pedigree analysis, crosses). If you master the logic, these become the EASIEST marks to secure.

### What Makes This Chapter Special?

1. **Predictable Question Types**: DNA replication, transcription, translation, genetic crosses appear EVERY year
2. **NCERT-Heavy**: 85-90% questions are directly from NCERT diagrams and text
3. **High Accuracy Potential**: Once you understand the concepts, there's no ambiguity
4. **Conceptual Continuity**: Concepts build on each other (DNA → RNA → Protein)
5. **Less Memorization**: More understanding-based than pure recall

> **AIIMS Topper Insight**: "I scored 100% in Genetics questions in NEET 2025 simply by practicing NCERT diagrams 10 times and solving 100 genetic crosses. No reference book needed." - Dr. Shekhar C Singh

## Part 1: The Central Dogma - DNA → RNA → Protein

This is the **foundation** of molecular biology. Every question ultimately tests your understanding of this flow.

### The Flow Chart

```
DNA (Gene)
   ↓ [Replication] → More DNA (Cell division)
   ↓ [Transcription] → mRNA
   ↓ [Translation] → Protein
   ↓
Functional Trait
```

**NEET Focus**: Questions test:
- Which enzyme is involved in each step?
- Where does each process occur (nucleus vs. cytoplasm)?
- What are the products of each step?
- Which process is semi-conservative, conservative, or dispersive?

---

## Part 2: DNA Replication - The Semi-Conservative Process

### Key Concept: Semi-Conservative Replication

**Definition**: Each new DNA molecule has one OLD strand (template) and one NEW strand (synthesized).

**Proof**: Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958) using ¹⁵N-labeled DNA.

### The Replication Process (Step-by-Step)

| Step | Enzyme/Protein | Function | NEET Tip |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **1. Initiation** | **Helicase** | Unwinds DNA double helix at **origin of replication (oriC)** | Always asked: "Which enzyme unwinds DNA?" Answer: Helicase |
| **2. Primer Binding** | **Primase** | Synthesizes short RNA primer (10-60 nucleotides) | DNA Polymerase CANNOT start synthesis without a primer |
| **3. Elongation** | **DNA Polymerase III** | Adds nucleotides in **5' → 3' direction** | NEVER 3' → 5'! This is asked repeatedly |
| **4. Leading Strand** | DNA Pol III | Continuous synthesis (single primer) | Easy to synthesize |
| **5. Lagging Strand** | DNA Pol III | Discontinuous synthesis → **Okazaki fragments** (1000-2000 nucleotides) | Each fragment needs a separate primer |
| **6. Primer Removal** | **DNA Polymerase I** | Removes RNA primers, fills gaps with DNA | Pol I has 5' → 3' exonuclease activity |
| **7. Ligation** | **DNA Ligase** | Joins Okazaki fragments on lagging strand | Creates phosphodiester bonds |

### Critical Diagram to Master

**Replication Fork** (NCERT Class 12, Chapter 6, Figure 6.4):
- Draw it 10 times
- Label: Leading strand, Lagging strand, Okazaki fragments, Helicase, DNA Polymerase, Primase, Ligase
- Direction of synthesis (5' → 3')

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: Which enzyme joins Okazaki fragments?
**Answer**: DNA Ligase

**Q2**: DNA replication is semi-conservative. What does this mean?
**Answer**: Each new DNA has one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.

**Q3**: In which direction does DNA Polymerase synthesize DNA?
**Answer**: 5' → 3' direction only (never 3' → 5')

**Q4**: Why is the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously?
**Answer**: DNA Polymerase can only synthesize in 5' → 3' direction, so the lagging strand (running 3' → 5') must be synthesized in short fragments (Okazaki fragments) backwards.

---

## Part 3: Transcription - DNA to RNA

### Definition

**Transcription**: Process of synthesizing RNA from a DNA template.

- **Input**: DNA (template strand, also called antisense strand)
- **Output**: mRNA (messenger RNA)
- **Location**: Nucleus (in eukaryotes)
- **Enzyme**: RNA Polymerase (no primer needed!)

### The 3 Stages of Transcription

| Stage | Events | Key Points |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **1. Initiation** | RNA Polymerase binds to **Promoter region** (TATA box in eukaryotes) | Promoter = where transcription starts |
| | Transcription factors help RNA Pol bind | σ (sigma) factor in prokaryotes |
| **2. Elongation** | RNA Polymerase moves along DNA template (3' → 5' direction) | Synthesizes RNA in 5' → 3' direction |
| | Adds complementary RNA nucleotides (A-U, G-C) | Uracil (U) replaces Thymine (T) in RNA |
| **3. Termination** | RNA Polymerase reaches **Terminator sequence** | In prokaryotes: Rho-dependent or Rho-independent |
| | mRNA is released | In eukaryotes: Cleavage and polyadenylation |

### Important Terminology

- **Template Strand (Antisense)**: DNA strand that is read by RNA Polymerase (runs 3' → 5')
- **Coding Strand (Sense)**: DNA strand that has the same sequence as mRNA (except T instead of U)
- **Promoter**: DNA sequence where RNA Polymerase binds to start transcription
- **Terminator**: DNA sequence where transcription stops

### mRNA Processing in Eukaryotes (Post-Transcriptional Modifications)

After transcription, the primary transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes 3 modifications:

1. **5' Capping**: 7-methylguanosine cap added to 5' end
   - **Function**: Protects mRNA from degradation, helps in ribosome binding
2. **3' Polyadenylation**: 200-250 adenine nucleotides (poly-A tail) added to 3' end
   - **Function**: Stability, export from nucleus
3. **Splicing**: Removal of **introns** (non-coding sequences), joining of **exons** (coding sequences)
   - **Enzyme**: Spliceosome
   - **Product**: Mature mRNA

**NEET Focus**: Prokaryotic mRNA does NOT undergo splicing (no introns). Eukaryotic mRNA has introns and exons.

### Critical Diagram to Master

**Transcription Unit** (NCERT Class 12, Chapter 6, Figure 6.11):
- Draw it 10 times
- Label: Promoter, Structural gene, Terminator
- Template strand vs. Coding strand
- Direction of RNA synthesis (5' → 3')

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: Which enzyme synthesizes mRNA from DNA?
**Answer**: RNA Polymerase

**Q2**: What is the function of the promoter in transcription?
**Answer**: Binding site for RNA Polymerase to initiate transcription

**Q3**: What is splicing?
**Answer**: Removal of introns and joining of exons in eukaryotic mRNA

**Q4**: Which modification protects mRNA from degradation?
**Answer**: 5' capping (7-methylguanosine cap)

---

## Part 4: Translation - RNA to Protein

### Definition

**Translation**: Process of synthesizing proteins from mRNA template.

- **Input**: mRNA (codons)
- **Output**: Polypeptide chain (protein)
- **Location**: Ribosomes (cytoplasm)
- **Adaptor molecule**: tRNA (transfer RNA)

### The Genetic Code

- **Codon**: 3-nucleotide sequence on mRNA that codes for 1 amino acid
- **Total codons**: 4³ = 64 codons
- **Amino acids**: 20 standard amino acids
- **Degeneracy**: Multiple codons can code for the same amino acid (redundancy)

**Special Codons**:
- **Start codon**: AUG (codes for Methionine) - translation begins here
- **Stop codons**: UAA, UAG, UGA (no amino acid, terminate translation)

### tRNA Structure

- **Shape**: Cloverleaf (2D), L-shaped (3D)
- **Anticodon**: 3-nucleotide sequence complementary to mRNA codon
- **Amino acid attachment site**: 3' end (CCA sequence)

**Function**: Brings the correct amino acid to the ribosome based on codon-anticodon pairing.

### The 3 Stages of Translation

| Stage | Events | Key Points |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **1. Initiation** | Small ribosomal subunit binds to mRNA at **start codon (AUG)** | Requires initiation factors |
| | First tRNA (with Methionine) binds to AUG | fMet-tRNA in prokaryotes, Met-tRNA in eukaryotes |
| | Large ribosomal subunit joins | Ribosome has 3 sites: A, P, E |
| **2. Elongation** | tRNA enters **A site** (aminoacyl site) with amino acid | Codon-anticodon recognition |
| | Peptide bond forms between amino acids (**peptidyl transferase** activity) | Ribosome catalyzes bond formation |
| | tRNA moves to **P site** (peptidyl site), old tRNA exits via **E site** (exit) | Translocation step |
| | Ribosome moves 3 nucleotides forward (1 codon) | Elongation continues until stop codon |
| **3. Termination** | Ribosome reaches **stop codon** (UAA, UAG, UGA) | No tRNA for stop codons |
| | **Release factors** bind to stop codon | Triggers polypeptide release |
| | Ribosome dissociates into subunits | Translation complete |

### Ribosome Structure

- **Prokaryotic ribosome**: 70S (50S + 30S subunits)
- **Eukaryotic ribosome**: 80S (60S + 40S subunits)

**NEET Tip**: S = Svedberg unit (sedimentation coefficient). 50S + 30S ≠ 80S (they don't add up arithmetically).

### Critical Diagram to Master

**tRNA Structure** (NCERT Class 12, Chapter 6, Figure 6.12):
- Draw it 10 times
- Label: Anticodon loop, Amino acid attachment site (3' CCA), Cloverleaf structure
- Hydrogen bonds between bases

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: What is the function of tRNA?
**Answer**: Brings amino acids to the ribosome during translation

**Q2**: What is the start codon?
**Answer**: AUG (codes for Methionine)

**Q3**: Name the stop codons.
**Answer**: UAA, UAG, UGA

**Q4**: Which site of the ribosome holds the growing polypeptide chain?
**Answer**: P site (peptidyl site)

**Q5**: How many amino acids are coded by 64 codons?
**Answer**: 20 amino acids (genetic code is degenerate/redundant)

## Part 5: Gene Regulation - The Lac Operon

### What is an Operon?

**Definition**: A cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter (in prokaryotes).

**Lac Operon** (NCERT Class 12, Chapter 6, most important operon for NEET):
- **Function**: Regulates lactose metabolism in *E. coli*
- **Type**: Inducible operon (turned ON by inducer - lactose)

### Structure of Lac Operon

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **i gene (Regulatory gene)** | Codes for **Repressor protein** |
| **Promoter (P)** | RNA Polymerase binding site |
| **Operator (O)** | Repressor protein binding site (blocks RNA Pol) |
| **Structural genes** | **z** (β-galactosidase), **y** (Permease), **a** (Transacetylase) |

### How Lac Operon Works

**Case 1: Lactose ABSENT (Operon OFF)**
1. Repressor protein (coded by i gene) binds to Operator (O)
2. RNA Polymerase cannot transcribe structural genes
3. No enzymes produced → Lactose cannot be metabolized

**Case 2: Lactose PRESENT (Operon ON)**
1. Lactose acts as **inducer**
2. Lactose binds to Repressor protein → Repressor changes shape → Cannot bind to Operator
3. RNA Polymerase can now transcribe structural genes (z, y, a)
4. Enzymes produced → Lactose is broken down

**NEET Tip**: Lac operon is an example of **negative regulation** (repressor protein blocks transcription).

### Critical Diagram to Master

**Lac Operon Diagram** (NCERT Class 12, Chapter 6, Figure 6.14 & 6.15):
- Draw both states: Lactose absent (OFF) and Lactose present (ON)
- Label: i gene, Promoter, Operator, z, y, a genes, Repressor protein, RNA Polymerase

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: What is the function of the repressor protein in lac operon?
**Answer**: Binds to the operator and prevents transcription when lactose is absent

**Q2**: What induces the lac operon?
**Answer**: Lactose (or allolactose)

**Q3**: Which gene codes for β-galactosidase?
**Answer**: z gene

**Q4**: Is lac operon inducible or repressible?
**Answer**: Inducible (turned ON by lactose)

## Part 6: Mendelian Genetics - Laws of Inheritance

### Mendel's Three Laws

| Law | Statement | Example |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| **1. Law of Dominance** | In a heterozygote, one allele (dominant) masks the other (recessive) | Tt (Tall) - T dominates over t |
| **2. Law of Segregation** | Alleles separate during gamete formation (each gamete gets one allele) | Tt → Gametes: T or t (50% each) |
| **3. Law of Independent Assortment** | Alleles of different genes assort independently during gamete formation | TtRr → Gametes: TR, Tr, tR, tr (equal probability) |

### Monohybrid Cross (1 Trait)

**Example**: Tall (T) × Short (t)

**P Generation**: TT (Tall) × tt (Short)
**F₁ Generation**: 100% Tt (Tall) - *Law of Dominance*
**F₂ Generation** (F₁ × F₁):
- Genotypic ratio: **1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt** (1:2:1)
- Phenotypic ratio: **3 Tall : 1 Short** (3:1)

**Key Insight**: The 3:1 ratio proves the *Law of Segregation*.

### Dihybrid Cross (2 Traits)

**Example**: Round Yellow (RRYY) × Wrinkled Green (rryy)

**P Generation**: RRYY × rryy
**F₁ Generation**: 100% RrYy (Round Yellow)
**F₂ Generation** (F₁ × F₁):
- Phenotypic ratio: **9:3:3:1**
  - 9 Round Yellow
  - 3 Round Green
  - 3 Wrinkled Yellow
  - 1 Wrinkled Green

**Key Insight**: The 9:3:3:1 ratio proves the *Law of Independent Assortment*.

### Test Cross vs. Back Cross

| Type | Definition | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Test Cross** | Cross between F₁ hybrid and homozygous recessive parent | Determine genotype of F₁ (Tt × tt) |
| **Back Cross** | Cross between F₁ hybrid and either parent | Can be with dominant or recessive parent |

**Test Cross Results**:
- If F₁ is Tt: Tt × tt → 1 Tt : 1 tt (1:1 ratio)
- If F₁ is TT: TT × tt → 100% Tt (all tall)

### Incomplete Dominance

**Definition**: Neither allele is completely dominant; heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype.

**Example**: Snapdragon flower color
- RR = Red
- rr = White
- **Rr = Pink** (intermediate)

**F₂ ratio**: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White (1:2:1) - *Phenotypic ratio = Genotypic ratio*

### Co-Dominance

**Definition**: Both alleles are expressed equally in the heterozygote.

**Example**: ABO Blood Groups
- I^A I^A or I^A i = Blood group A
- I^B I^B or I^B i = Blood group B
- **I^A I^B = Blood group AB** (both A and B antigens present)
- ii = Blood group O

**NEET Tip**: ABO blood group genetics is asked in EVERY NEET paper.

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: In a monohybrid cross, what is the phenotypic ratio in F₂?
**Answer**: 3:1

**Q2**: What is the genotypic ratio in F₂ of a monohybrid cross?
**Answer**: 1:2:1 (1 homozygous dominant : 2 heterozygous : 1 homozygous recessive)

**Q3**: What is the purpose of a test cross?
**Answer**: To determine the genotype of an organism with dominant phenotype

**Q4**: What type of dominance is seen in snapdragon flowers?
**Answer**: Incomplete dominance (Pink = intermediate phenotype)

**Q5**: What is the phenotypic ratio in a dihybrid cross F₂?
**Answer**: 9:3:3:1

## Part 7: Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance

### Key Concepts

1. **Genes are located on chromosomes** (Sutton and Boveri, 1902)
2. **Linkage**: Genes on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together
3. **Crossing Over**: Exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis
4. **Recombination**: Production of offspring with genetic combinations different from parents

### Sex Determination

| System | Organisms | Determination |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **XY** | Humans, *Drosophila*, most mammals | Male = XY, Female = XX |
| **ZW** | Birds, some butterflies | Male = ZZ, Female = ZW |
| **XO** | Grasshoppers, some insects | Male = XO (one X), Female = XX |

**NEET Focus**: Human sex determination (XY system) and sex-linked inheritance.

### Sex-Linked Inheritance

**Example**: Color blindness, Hemophilia (both X-linked recessive)

**Notation**:
- X^C = Normal vision allele
- X^c = Color blindness allele
- Y = Y chromosome (no allele for color vision)

**Cross**: Normal woman (carrier) × Normal man
- X^C X^c × X^C Y
- **Offspring**:
  - 25% X^C X^C (Normal daughter)
  - 25% X^C X^c (Carrier daughter)
  - 25% X^C Y (Normal son)
  - 25% X^c Y (Color blind son)

**Key Insight**: Males are more affected by X-linked recessive disorders because they have only one X chromosome (hemizygous).

### Pedigree Analysis

**Symbols**:
- Square = Male
- Circle = Female
- Filled = Affected
- Half-filled = Carrier
- Horizontal line = Mating
- Vertical line = Offspring

**Common Patterns**:
- **Autosomal Dominant**: Affected in every generation, both sexes equally affected
- **Autosomal Recessive**: Skips generations, consanguineous marriages increase risk
- **X-linked Recessive**: More males affected, carrier females, affected males have normal daughters

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: What is the sex chromosome composition of a human male?
**Answer**: XY

**Q2**: Which parent determines the sex of the child in humans?
**Answer**: Father (contributes X or Y chromosome)

**Q3**: Why are males more affected by hemophilia?
**Answer**: Hemophilia is X-linked recessive. Males have only one X chromosome, so one recessive allele causes the disease.

**Q4**: What is linkage?
**Answer**: Genes located on the same chromosome that tend to be inherited together

## Part 8: DNA as Genetic Material - Historical Experiments

### 1. Griffith's Transformation Experiment (1928)

**Organism**: *Streptococcus pneumoniae*

**Observations**:
- S strain (Smooth, virulent, has capsule) → Kills mice
- R strain (Rough, non-virulent, no capsule) → Mice survive
- Heat-killed S strain → Mice survive
- Heat-killed S + Live R → **Mice die** (R transformed to S)

**Conclusion**: Some "transforming principle" from dead S cells transformed R cells to virulent S cells.

### 2. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty Experiment (1944)

**Question**: What is the transforming principle?

**Method**:
- Treated heat-killed S cells with different enzymes:
  - Protease (destroys proteins) → Transformation still occurs
  - RNase (destroys RNA) → Transformation still occurs
  - **DNase (destroys DNA)** → **Transformation does NOT occur**

**Conclusion**: DNA is the transforming principle (genetic material).

### 3. Hershey-Chase Experiment (1952)

**Organism**: Bacteriophage (T2 phage) infecting *E. coli*

**Method**:
- Labeled DNA with radioactive ³²P (phosphorus in DNA)
- Labeled protein coat with radioactive ³⁵S (sulfur in proteins)
- Infected bacteria, blended to remove coats, centrifuged

**Results**:
- ³²P (DNA) found inside bacteria
- ³⁵S (Protein) remained outside

**Conclusion**: DNA, not protein, is the genetic material injected into bacteria.

**NEET Tip**: This is the most asked experiment. Remember: ³²P = DNA (inside), ³⁵S = Protein (outside).

### Common NEET Questions

**Q1**: Who discovered the transforming principle?
**Answer**: Griffith (1928)

**Q2**: Who proved that DNA is the transforming principle?
**Answer**: Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944)

**Q3**: In Hershey-Chase experiment, which radioactive isotope was used to label DNA?
**Answer**: ³²P (Phosphorus-32)

**Q4**: What was the conclusion of Hershey-Chase experiment?
**Answer**: DNA is the genetic material, not protein

## Part 11: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Confusing DNA Replication Direction

**Wrong**: "DNA is synthesized in 3' → 5' direction"
**Correct**: DNA is **always** synthesized in **5' → 3' direction** (by DNA Polymerase)

**NEET Trap**: Questions will give options with both directions. Remember: 5' → 3' is correct.

### Mistake 2: Mixing Up Template vs. Coding Strand

**Template Strand** (Antisense):
- Read by RNA Polymerase (3' → 5' direction)
- Complementary to mRNA

**Coding Strand** (Sense):
- Same sequence as mRNA (except T instead of U)
- NOT used as template

**NEET Tip**: If question gives coding strand sequence, convert T to U to get mRNA.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Stop Codons

**Start Codon**: AUG (only one)
**Stop Codons**: UAA, UAG, UGA (three - memorize as "U Are Annoying, U Are Gross, U Go Away")

**NEET Trap**: Questions ask "Which is NOT a stop codon?" - AUG is NOT a stop codon.

### Mistake 4: Lac Operon Confusion

**Common Error**: "Repressor protein binds to promoter"
**Correct**: Repressor binds to **Operator** (not promoter). RNA Polymerase binds to promoter.

### Mistake 5: Mendelian Ratio Errors

**Monohybrid F₂**:
- Genotypic ratio: 1:2:1 (TT : Tt : tt)
- Phenotypic ratio: 3:1 (Tall : Short)

**Dihybrid F₂**:
- Phenotypic ratio: 9:3:3:1 (not 3:1!)

**Test Cross**:
- Ratio: 1:1 (if heterozygous) or 1:0 (if homozygous)

**NEET Trap**: Questions swap ratios. Read carefully!

### Mistake 6: Sex-Linked Inheritance

**Common Error**: "Daughters inherit X chromosome only from mother"
**Correct**: Daughters inherit **one X from mother, one X from father** (XX)

**Sons**: Inherit X from mother, Y from father (XY)

## Part 12: Scoring Strategy - How to Maximize Marks

### Strategy 1: Master Problem-Solving First

**Why**: Genetic crosses (monohybrid, dihybrid, sex-linked) are the EASIEST marks if you know the method.

**Action Plan**:
- Practice 50 monohybrid crosses
- Practice 30 dihybrid crosses
- Practice 20 sex-linked crosses
- Practice 10 ABO blood group problems

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours total. **Return**: 3-4 guaranteed correct answers = 12-16 marks.

### Strategy 2: Memorize All Enzyme Names

Create a table and memorize:

| Process | Enzyme/Protein | Function |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Replication | Helicase | Unwinds DNA |
| | Primase | Synthesizes RNA primer |
| | DNA Pol III | Adds nucleotides (5' → 3') |
| | DNA Pol I | Removes primers, fills gaps |
| | DNA Ligase | Joins Okazaki fragments |
| Transcription | RNA Polymerase | Synthesizes mRNA from DNA |
| | Spliceosome | Removes introns (splicing) |
| Translation | Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase | Attaches amino acid to tRNA |
| | Peptidyl transferase | Forms peptide bond (ribosome) |
| | Release factors | Terminates translation at stop codon |

**Time Investment**: 1 hour. **Return**: 2-3 questions = 8-12 marks.

### Strategy 3: Practice Diagrams Daily

**Critical Diagrams** (10 total - listed in Part 10):
- DNA replication fork
- Transcription unit
- tRNA structure
- Lac operon (ON/OFF)
- Punnett squares (monohybrid, dihybrid)

**Practice Routine**:
- Draw 2-3 diagrams daily for 15 minutes
- Focus on accurate labeling (not artistic perfection)

**Time Investment**: 15 min/day × 20 days = 5 hours. **Return**: 2-4 diagram-based questions = 8-16 marks.

### Strategy 4: Memorize Historical Experiments

Only 3 experiments are repeatedly asked:

1. **Griffith's Transformation** (1928)
2. **Avery-MacLeod-McCarty** (1944) - DNA is transforming principle
3. **Hershey-Chase** (1952) - ³²P (DNA) vs. ³⁵S (Protein)

**Time Investment**: 30 minutes. **Return**: 1-2 questions = 4-8 marks.

### Strategy 5: NCERT Line-by-Line for Conceptual Questions

**Target Pages**: NCERT Class 12 Biology
- Chapter 5 (Principles of Inheritance): Pages 80-100
- Chapter 6 (Molecular Basis of Inheritance): Pages 102-125

**Time Investment**: 8-10 hours (2 chapters). **Return**: 4-6 conceptual questions = 16-24 marks.

## Part 14: FAQs - Students' Most Common Doubts

### Q1: Is reference book needed for Genetics & Molecular Biology?

**Answer**: NO. NCERT Class 12 (Chapters 5 and 6) is sufficient for 90% questions. Focus on:
- Line-by-line reading (2 times minimum)
- Diagram practice (10 critical diagrams)
- NCERT exercise questions + examples

Only if you've mastered NCERT and want extra practice, use:
- **Trueman's Biology (Volume 2)** for additional MCQs
- **Previous Year NEET questions** (most important)

### Q2: How many Genetics questions come in NEET?

**Answer**: 8-12 questions (32-48 marks) combined from:
- Molecular Basis of Inheritance (4-6 questions)
- Principles of Inheritance & Variation (4-6 questions)

This is the **second-highest scoring unit** after Human Physiology.

### Q3: How to solve genetic cross problems fast?

**Step-by-step method**:
1. Write genotype of parents
2. Write possible gametes for each parent
3. Make Punnett square (2×2 for monohybrid, 4×4 for dihybrid)
4. Fill in offspring genotypes
5. Count phenotypes and calculate ratio

**Time**: With practice, monohybrid = 1 min, dihybrid = 2-3 mins.

**Practice**: Solve 50 problems in 2 weeks. Speed will improve automatically.

### Q4: How to remember all enzyme names?

**Mnemonic for DNA Replication**:
"**H**appy **P**eople **P**repare **P**erfect **L**unch"
- **H**elicase (unwinds)
- **P**rimase (primer)
- **P**olymerase III (adds nucleotides)
- **P**olymerase I (removes primers)
- **L**igase (joins fragments)

**Transcription**: Only one enzyme - **RNA Polymerase** (easy!)

**Translation**: Focus on **Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase** (charges tRNA with amino acid) and **Peptidyl transferase** (forms peptide bond).

### Q5: What is the best way to practice diagrams?

**5-Step Method**:
1. **Understand** the process first (read NCERT explanation)
2. **Observe** the NCERT diagram carefully (labels, arrows, direction)
3. **Draw** from memory on blank paper (no peeking)
4. **Compare** with NCERT, mark mistakes in red
5. **Repeat** until 100% accurate

**Target**: 10 critical diagrams × 10 practice sessions each = 100 total diagrams drawn.

**Time**: 15-20 minutes per day for 20 days.

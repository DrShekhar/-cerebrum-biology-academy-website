# NEET Biology Preparation Strategy: Score 340+ out of 360

Biology is the highest-scoring subject in NEET, contributing 50% of the total marks (360 out of 720). For top medical colleges like AIIMS and GMCs, you need to score **340+ in Biology** (95%+). With the right strategy, this is absolutely achievable.

## Why 340+ is the Target

- **AIIMS Delhi cutoff**: Requires 680+ overall → Biology score of 340+ is essential
- **Top 1000 AIR**: Average Biology score is 345-355
- **Biology is easier to master**: Unlike Physics, consistent effort guarantees results

## Understanding NEET Biology Pattern

The NEET biology section consists of:

- **Botany (Class 11 & 12): 180 marks** (45 questions)
- **Zoology (Class 11 & 12): 180 marks** (45 questions)
- **Total Biology: 360 marks** (90 questions)

### High-Weightage Topics (Must Master):

**Botany:**

- Plant Kingdom & Morphology (8-10 questions)
- Photosynthesis & Respiration (6-8 questions)
- Plant Reproduction (5-6 questions)
- Genetics & Biotechnology (10-12 questions)

**Zoology:**

- Animal Kingdom & Diversity (6-8 questions)
- Human Physiology Systems (15-18 questions)
- Genetics & Evolution (8-10 questions)
- Reproduction & Development (6-8 questions)

## 6-Month Preparation Timeline

### Months 1-2: Foundation Building

- Complete NCERT textbooks (Class 11 & 12) with deep understanding
- Create mind maps for each chapter
- Practice diagrams daily (15-20 minutes)
- Target: 280-300 marks in mock tests

### Months 3-4: Concept Strengthening

- Solve previous year questions chapter-wise (2014-2024)
- Join test series for regular assessment
- Focus on weak areas identified through tests
- Target: 310-320 marks in mock tests

### Months 5-6: Revision & Mock Tests

- Multiple revisions of all NCERT chapters (minimum 3 revisions)
- Daily full-length mock tests and detailed analysis
- Quick revision notes and formula sheets
- Target: 340+ marks consistently

## Study Techniques That Work

### 1. Active Learning Methods

- Explain concepts aloud (Feynman Technique)
- Create flowcharts for complex processes
- Use mnemonics for classification and facts

### 2. Diagram Practice Strategy

- Draw 5 diagrams daily from different topics
- Practice labeling without looking
- Focus on NCERT diagram exactness - every label matters!

### 3. Memory Techniques for Biology

- **For Classifications**: Create acronyms and rhymes
- **For Processes**: Use flowcharts and cycle diagrams
- **For Numbers/Facts**: Link with real-life examples

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring NCERT**: 85% questions come directly from NCERT - read it 5+ times
2. **Skipping Diagrams**: Diagrams carry 15-20 marks minimum
3. **Rote Learning**: Focus on understanding concepts first
4. **Neglecting Revision**: Without revision, you'll forget 80% in 2 weeks
5. **Attempting too many books**: NCERT + one reference book is enough

## Daily Study Schedule for 340+

**Morning (2.5 hours):**

- 1.5 hours: New topic study from NCERT
- 30 minutes: Previous day revision
- 30 minutes: Diagram practice

**Evening (2 hours):**

- 1 hour: Previous Year Questions practice
- 30 minutes: Weak topic revision
- 30 minutes: Quick notes making

## Expected Score Timeline

- **Month 2**: 280-300 marks (foundation complete)
- **Month 4**: 310-325 marks (strengthening phase)
- **Month 6**: 340-355 marks (exam ready!)

## Key Books for 340+

1. **NCERT Biology Class 11 & 12** - Primary source (read 5+ times)
2. **NCERT Exemplar** - For application-based questions
3. **Previous Year Questions (2014-2024)** - Pattern understanding
4. **MTG Fingertips** - Quick revision and MCQ practice

## Final Tips for 340+ Score

1. **Never skip a day** - Biology needs consistent daily effort
2. **Analyze every mock test** - Learn from mistakes
3. **Focus on accuracy over speed** - In Biology, accuracy = marks
4. **Sleep 7-8 hours** - Memory consolidation happens during sleep
5. **Revise NCERT the night before exam** - Fresh memory recall

With consistent effort and the right guidance, scoring **340+ in NEET Biology** is absolutely achievable. Remember, biology rewards those who are thorough and consistent.

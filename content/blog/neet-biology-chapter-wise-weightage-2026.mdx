## Final Tips for Biology Preparation

1. **Read NCERT like a novel** - Every line, every example
2. **Draw diagrams daily** - At least 5 diagrams
3. **Memorize tables and lists** - Use mnemonics
4. **Solve PYQs chapter-wise** - Identify patterns
5. **Revise Human Physiology most** - Highest ROI
6. **Don't skip any chapter** - Even low-weightage chapters give 5-10 marks

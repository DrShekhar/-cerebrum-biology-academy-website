# Human Physiology for NEET: Complete Guide to Score 50+ Marks

**Human Physiology** is the **single highest-scoring chapter** in NEET Biology, consistently contributing **12-15 questions (48-60 marks)** - that's nearly **17% of your entire Biology score** from just one chapter. If you master Human Physiology, you've secured **1/6th of your total NEET marks** (60 out of 720).

Yet, most students struggle with Physiology because they treat it as "theory to memorize" rather than "processes to understand."

**The truth:** Physiology is the EASIEST high-scoring chapter if you approach it systematically.

**Why Physiology is Different:**
- **Genetics**: Abstract concepts (pedigrees, crosses) - harder to visualize
- **Ecology**: Vast scope (200+ terms) - memorization overload
- **Physiology**: Logical processes + visual diagrams + NCERT-focused = Perfect for maximizing marks

This comprehensive guide breaks down all 5 major physiological systems, provides NCERT-focused strategies, highlights critical diagrams, shares common mistakes to avoid, and gives you a system-wise scoring plan to secure 50+ marks from this goldmine chapter.

## The 5 Major Systems: Complete Breakdown

### System 1: Digestive System (3-4 Questions = 12-16 Marks)

**NCERT Coverage:** Class 11, Chapter 16: Digestion and Absorption

#### High-Yield Topics

| Sub-Topic | Weightage | Key Concepts to Master |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Alimentary Canal Structure** | 1-2 Q | Mouth → Stomach → Small Intestine → Large Intestine (sequence, length, functions) |

> "**P**epsin **P**eptones, **T**rypsin **P**eptides, **D**ipeptidases **A**mino acids"
> (Pepsin breaks to Peptones, Trypsin breaks to Peptides, Dipeptidases break to Amino acids)

#### NCERT Lines That Repeat in NEET

> "Thecodont, diphyodont, heterodont dentition" - Describe these terms.

> "Adult human has 32 permanent teeth which are of four different types (heterodont dentition), namely, incisors (I), canine (C), premolars (PM) and molars (M)."

> "An adult human has 16 teeth in each jaw. Each half of the upper and lower jaw has the arrangement of teeth as 2123 / ICPM (dental formula)."

> "Stomach stores the food for 4-5 hours."

> "Liver is the largest gland of the body weighing about 1.2 to 1.5 kg in an adult human."

> "Pancreas acts as both exocrine (digestive enzymes) and endocrine gland (insulin, glucagon)."

**Strategy:** Highlight these exact lines in your NCERT. They appear as "fill in the blanks" or "assertion-reason" questions.

### System 2: Respiratory System (2-3 Questions = 8-12 Marks)

**NCERT Coverage:** Class 11, Chapter 17: Breathing and Exchange of Gases

#### High-Yield Topics

| Sub-Topic | Weightage | Key Concepts |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Respiratory Organs** | 0-1 Q | Nostrils → Pharynx → Larynx → Trachea → Bronchi → Bronchioles → Alveoli |
| **Mechanism of Breathing** | 1-2 Q | Inspiration (diaphragm contracts, ribs lift) vs Expiration (diaphragm relaxes, ribs fall) |
| **Lung Volumes** | 1 Q | Tidal Volume, Vital Capacity, Residual Volume, Total Lung Capacity (values + definitions) |
| **Transport of Gases** | 1 Q | O₂ via Hb (oxyhemoglobin), CO₂ via plasma (70%), HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate) |
| **Respiratory Disorders** | 0-1 Q | Asthma, Emphysema, COPD, Pneumonia |

#### Critical Diagrams

1. **Human Respiratory System** (Full labeled diagram)
   - Label: Nasal cavity, Pharynx, Epiglottis, Larynx (voice box), Trachea (windpipe), Lungs, Bronchi, Diaphragm
   - **NEET Favorite:** "Which structure prevents food from entering the windpipe?" → Epiglottis

2. **Structure of Alveolus** (Site of gas exchange)
   - Label: Alveolar epithelium, Capillary network, RBCs, Diffusion of O₂ and CO₂
   - **NEET Favorite:** "Where does actual gas exchange occur?" → Alveoli

#### Lung Volumes (HIGH-YIELD TABLE)

| Volume/Capacity | Normal Value | Definition |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| **Tidal Volume (TV)** | **500 mL** | Volume of air inspired/expired in normal breath |
| **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)** | 2500-3000 mL | Additional air inspired after normal inspiration |
| **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)** | 1000-1100 mL | Additional air expired after normal expiration |
| **Residual Volume (RV)** | 1100-1200 mL | Air remaining in lungs after forceful expiration |
| **Vital Capacity (VC)** | **4000 mL** | TV + IRV + ERV (maximum air exhaled after deep breath) |
| **Total Lung Capacity (TLC)** | **5000-6000 mL** | VC + RV (total air lungs can hold) |

**NEET Formula Questions:**
- **Vital Capacity (VC) = TV + IRV + ERV**
- **Total Lung Capacity (TLC) = VC + RV**
- **Inspiratory Capacity (IC) = TV + IRV**

**Common MCQ:** "A person's tidal volume is 500 mL, IRV is 3000 mL, ERV is 1100 mL, and RV is 1200 mL. Calculate Vital Capacity."
**Answer:** VC = 500 + 3000 + 1100 = **4600 mL**

---

### 💡 Why This Matters: Real-World Application

**Beyond NEET**: Understanding lung volumes isn't just exam fodder. It's the foundation of pulmonary function testing used in hospitals worldwide.

**Real-world examples:**
- **Spirometry tests** (PFT - Pulmonary Function Test) measure your Vital Capacity and Tidal Volume to diagnose asthma, COPD, and lung diseases
- **Ventilator settings** in ICU use Tidal Volume calculations (typically 6-8 mL/kg body weight) to support critically ill patients
- **Athletes undergo VO₂ max testing** - measuring maximum oxygen consumption during exercise - based on the same gas exchange principles you study

**Career relevance**: In medical school, you'll learn to interpret PFT reports in Medicine rotation. Understanding these volumes NOW prepares you for Respiratory Physiology in MBBS Year 2.

**Fun fact**: Competitive swimmers and athletes have Vital Capacities of 5500-6000 mL (vs normal 4000 mL) due to respiratory muscle training.

---

#### Transport of Gases (Conceptual Clarity)

**Oxygen Transport:**
1. **97%** of O₂ transported as **Oxyhemoglobin** (Hb + O₂ → HbO₂)
2. **3%** dissolved in blood plasma
3. Each Hb molecule binds **4 O₂ molecules**
4. Binding is affected by **partial pressure** (pO₂), pH, temperature

**Carbon Dioxide Transport:**
1. **70%** as **Bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻)** in plasma
2. **23%** bound to **Hemoglobin** (Carbaminohemoglobin)
3. **7%** dissolved in plasma

**Mnemonic for CO₂ Transport:**
> "**70-23-7 Rule:** **70 Bicarb, 23 Carb, 7 Dissolved**"

---

### System 3: Circulatory System (4-5 Questions = 16-20 Marks)

**NCERT Coverage:** Class 11, Chapter 18: Body Fluids and Circulation

**HIGHEST SCORING SYSTEM** - Nearly 1/3rd of Human Physiology marks come from circulation alone.

#### High-Yield Topics

| Sub-Topic | Weightage | Key Concepts |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Heart Structure** | 2 Q | 4 chambers, valves, coronary arteries, double circulation |
| **Cardiac Cycle** | 1 Q | Systole (contraction) vs Diastole (relaxation), 0.8 sec duration, 72 beats/min |
| **Cardiac Output** | 1 Q | CO = Stroke Volume × Heart Rate = 70 mL × 72 = 5000 mL/min ≈ 5 L/min |

     - "Valve between right atrium and right ventricle?" → Tricuspid (3 flaps)
     - "Valve between left atrium and left ventricle?" → Bicuspid/Mitral (2 flaps)
     - "Only artery carrying deoxygenated blood?" → Pulmonary Artery
     - "Only vein carrying oxygenated blood?" → Pulmonary Vein

2. **Double Circulation Pathway** (Diagram with arrows)
   - Pulmonary Circulation: Right Ventricle → Pulmonary Artery → Lungs → Pulmonary Vein → Left Atrium
   - Systemic Circulation: Left Ventricle → Aorta → Body → Vena Cava → Right Atrium
   - **NEET Favorite:** "Trace the path of oxygenated blood from lungs to body tissues."

3. **Structure of RBC (Erythrocyte)**
   - Biconcave disc, no nucleus (in mammals), contains hemoglobin, lifespan 120 days
   - **NEET Twist:** "Which animal has nucleated RBCs?" → Camel (exception in mammals)

#### Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)

- **Normal BP:** **120/80 mm Hg**
  - **120 (Systolic):** Pressure during ventricular contraction
  - **80 (Diastolic):** Pressure during ventricular relaxation
- **Hypertension:** BP consistently > 140/90 mm Hg
- **Hypotension:** BP < 90/60 mm Hg

#### Blood Groups (ABO System)

| Blood Group | Antigens on RBC | Antibodies in Plasma | Can Donate To | Can Receive From |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **A** | A | Anti-B | A, AB | A, O |
| **B** | B | Anti-A | B, AB | B, O |
| **AB** | A, B | None | **AB only** | **A, B, AB, O (Universal Recipient)** |
| **O** | None | Anti-A, Anti-B | **A, B, AB, O (Universal Donor)** | **O only** |

**Rh Factor:**
- **Rh+** (Rh positive): Has Rh antigen (85% population)
- **Rh-** (Rh negative): No Rh antigen (15% population)
- **Erythroblastosis fetalis:** Rh- mother + Rh+ fetus → Mother develops anti-Rh antibodies → Can affect second Rh+ pregnancy

**Mnemonic for Universal Donor/Recipient:**
> "**O is the Hero (Donor), AB is the Zero (Recipient)**"
> (O can give to all, AB can take from all but can't give to others)

#### Cardiac Cycle (0.8 sec Total)

| Phase | Duration | Events | Blood Flow |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Atrial Systole** | 0.1 sec | Atria contract → Blood pushed to ventricles | Atria → Ventricles |
| **Ventricular Systole** | 0.3 sec | Ventricles contract → Blood pushed to arteries | Ventricles → Aorta + Pulmonary Artery |
| **Joint Diastole** | 0.4 sec | Both atria & ventricles relax → Blood fills heart | Veins → Atria → Ventricles (passive) |

**Heart Sounds:**
- **First sound ("Lubb"):** Closure of Tricuspid + Bicuspid valves (start of ventricular systole)
- **Second sound ("Dupp"):** Closure of Semilunar valves (Aortic + Pulmonary valves)

2. **L.S. of Kidney** (Longitudinal Section)
   - Label: Cortex, Medulla, Renal pelvis, Ureter, Renal artery, Renal vein, Nephrons
   - **NEET Favorite:** "Where are Bowman's capsules located?" → Cortex

#### 3 Steps of Urine Formation

| Step | Location | Process | What Happens | Result |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Ultrafiltration** | Glomerulus → Bowman's Capsule | Blood pressure forces water + small molecules through glomerular capillaries | Forms glomerular filtrate (180 L/day) | Filtrate contains water, glucose, amino acids, salts, urea, uric acid |
| **2. Reabsorption** | PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT | Useful substances absorbed back into blood | **99% of filtrate reabsorbed** (178.5 L/day) | Only 1.5 L/day becomes urine |
| **3. Tubular Secretion** | DCT, Collecting Duct | Waste products (K⁺, H⁺, ammonia) actively secreted into tubule | Final urine composition adjusted | Urine ready for excretion |

**Maximum Reabsorption Sites:**
- **PCT:** 70-80% of filtrate (water, glucose, amino acids, Na⁺, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, K⁺, urea)
- **Loop of Henle:** Water (descending limb), Na⁺, Cl⁻ (ascending limb) - concentrates urine
- **DCT + Collecting Duct:** Water (ADH-regulated), Na⁺ (Aldosterone-regulated)

**Mnemonic for Nephron Parts:**
> "**GB → PC → Loop → DC → Collection**"
> (Glomerulus-Bowman's → PCT → Loop of Henle → DCT → Collecting duct)

#### Hormonal Regulation

| Hormone | Source | Target | Action | Effect on Urine |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **ADH** (Vasopressin) | Posterior Pituitary | DCT + Collecting Duct | Increases water reabsorption | Concentrated urine (less volume) |
| **Aldosterone** | Adrenal Cortex | DCT | Increases Na⁺ reabsorption (& water follows) | Increased blood volume, less urine |
| **ANF** (Atrial Natriuretic Factor) | Heart (Atria) | Kidney | Decreases Na⁺ reabsorption (↓ blood pressure) | Dilute urine (more volume) |

**Common NEET Question:** "If ADH secretion is reduced, what happens?"
**Answer:** More dilute urine in large quantities (Diabetes Insipidus)

---

### System 5: Neural Control & Coordination (3-4 Questions = 12-16 Marks)

#### Resting vs Action Potential

| State | Membrane Potential | Ions | Cause |
|-------|-------------------|------|-------|
| **Resting Potential** | **-70 mV** (inside negative) | High K⁺ inside, High Na⁺ outside | Na⁺-K⁺ pump (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in) |
| **Depolarization** (Action Potential) | **+30 mV** (inside positive) | Na⁺ rushes INSIDE | Na⁺ channels open |
| **Repolarization** | Return to -70 mV | K⁺ moves OUTSIDE | K⁺ channels open, Na⁺ channels close |

**Threshold Potential:** -55 mV (minimum stimulus strength needed to trigger action potential)

**All-or-None Law:** Once threshold is reached, action potential is ALWAYS the same magnitude (+30 mV). There's no "weak" or "strong" action potential.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Memorizing Without Understanding

**Wrong Approach:** Rote-learning enzyme names and functions without understanding the digestive process flow.

**Impact:** Forget everything within 2 days; can't answer application-based questions.

**Right Approach:**
1. First, understand the **logical flow** (Food enters mouth → Saliva acts on starch → Stomach acid denatures proteins → etc.)
2. Then memorize specific enzyme names and substrates
3. Connect to real-life (Why do you chew food? To mix with saliva. Why does your stomach hurt if empty? Acid on stomach lining.)

---

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Diagrams

**Wrong Approach:** Reading text but not practicing diagram labeling.

**Impact:** 4-5 questions lost (16-20 marks) due to incorrect labels or structure identification.

**Statistics:** 30% of students lose marks on diagram questions despite knowing theory.

**Right Approach - The 5-Step Diagram Method:**
1. **Trace** the diagram with your finger while looking at NCERT (understand spatial relationships)
2. **Draw** from memory on blank paper (no peeking)
3. **Label** all parts from memory (write full names, not abbreviations)
4. **Check** against NCERT (circle mistakes in red)
5. **Repeat** until you get 100% accuracy

**Practice Schedule:**

### Mistake #3: Confusing Similar Terms

Common confusions students make:

| Confused Terms | Actual Meaning | How to Remember |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Systole vs Diastole** | Systole = Contraction; Diastole = Relaxation | **Sys**tole = **Sys**tem ON (contraction) |
| **Artery vs Vein** | Artery = From heart; Vein = To heart | **A**rtery = **A**way from heart |
| **Afferent vs Efferent** | Afferent = Toward; Efferent = Away | **A**fferent = **A**pproaching |
| **Antigen vs Antibody** | Antigen = Foreign substance; Antibody = Defense protein | **Anti**gen = **Anti** (against) our body |
| **ADH vs ACTH** | ADH = Water reabsorption; ACTH = Adrenal stimulation | **ADH** = **A**nti-**D**iuretic (prevents urine) |

---

### Mistake #4: Not Practicing MCQs

**Wrong Approach:** Reading NCERT 3 times but not solving MCQs.

**Impact:** Can't identify how questions are twisted; time management poor in exam.

**Right Approach - The 50-MCQ Rule:**

After completing each system:
1. **Solve 50 MCQs** on that system (timed: 50 questions in 50 minutes)
2. **Score yourself** - Calculate accuracy percentage
3. **Analyze every wrong answer** using this framework:
   - Was it a **concept gap** (didn't understand the topic)?
   - Was it a **memory lapse** (knew it but forgot the fact)?
   - Did I **misread the question** (read too fast)?
   - Was it a **silly mistake** (marked wrong option by accident)?
4. **Create flashcards** for concept gaps and memory lapses
5. **Re-attempt wrong questions** after 3 days

**MCQ Practice Schedule:**
- **Week 1**: Digestion (50 MCQs) + Respiration (50 MCQs) = 100 total
- **Week 2**: Circulation (75 MCQs - highest weightage) = 75 total
- **Week 3**: Excretion (50 MCQs) + Neural (50 MCQs) = 100 total
- **Week 4**: Mixed MCQs (all systems) = 200 total
- **Target accuracy**: Week 1: 70% → Week 2: 80% → Week 3-4: 90%+

**Best MCQ Sources:**
- **NCERT Exemplar** (highest quality, official CBSE)
- **NEET PYQ Bank 2015-2025** (must-do - shows exact question patterns)
- **Cerebrum Chapter-wise Test Series** [Take free test](/mock-tests)
- **AIIMS/JIPMER Archives** (for tough practice)

## Scoring Strategy: How to Secure 50+ Marks

### Difficulty-Based Approach

In Human Physiology, questions are typically distributed as:
- **Easy (Direct NCERT):** 8-10 questions = 32-40 marks
- **Medium (Slight twist):** 3-4 questions = 12-16 marks
- **Difficult (Application):** 1-2 questions = 4-8 marks

**Your Strategy:**

| Your Preparation Level | Target Questions | Expected Marks | What to Focus On |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Beginner (Just started)** | 8-9 / 13 | 28-32 marks | Master diagrams + Enzyme tables + Blood groups |
| **Intermediate (60% syllabus)** | 11-12 / 13 | 40-44 marks | Add hormones + Nephron function + Cardiac cycle |
| **Advanced (90% syllabus)** | 13-14 / 13 | **52-56 marks** | Cover ALL topics + MCQ practice + Speed |

**Realistic Target:** With 4 weeks of focused preparation, you should aim for **11-12 correct** (44-48 marks).

**To Reach 50+ Marks:**
- **90% accuracy on diagrams** (4-5 questions = 20 marks secured)
- **100% accuracy on direct NCERT** (6-7 questions = 24-28 marks)
- **50% accuracy on application** (1-2 questions = 4-8 marks)
- **Total:** 50-56 marks 🎯

## Time Management in Exam

**Human Physiology in NEET 2026:**
- Total Biology: 90 questions in 90 minutes
- Physiology: 12-15 questions
- **Target time:** 12-15 minutes for all Physiology questions

**Question-Wise Timing:**

| Question Type | Time Allocation | Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Diagram-based** (4-5 Q) | **30 seconds each** | Instant recognition; don't overthink |
| **Direct fact recall** (5-6 Q) | **40 seconds each** | If you know, mark immediately; if not, skip |
| **Application/Reasoning** (2-3 Q) | **1.5 minutes each** | Read carefully, eliminate options, then mark |

**Pro Tip:** Attempt Physiology questions FIRST in Biology section. They're factual and diagram-heavy (high confidence) → Build momentum early.

## FAQs: Human Physiology for NEET

**Q1: Is NCERT enough for Human Physiology, or should I refer to H.C. Verma/Trueman's Biology?**

**A:** **NCERT is MORE than enough** for Human Physiology. In fact, **90% of Physiology questions are directly from NCERT**. Reference books add unnecessary complexity and confuse students with extra details not asked in NEET.

**What to do:**
- Read NCERT Class 11 Chapters 16-22 **line by line** (including examples, brackets, and tables)
- Practice NCERT diagrams repeatedly
- Solve NCERT in-text and exercise questions
- After NCERT mastery, solve PYQs (Previous Year Questions) for practice

**When to use reference books:**
- Only if you've completed NCERT 3 times and still have time
- For additional MCQ practice (not for theory)
- Trueman's Biology (only MCQ section, not theory)

At **Cerebrum Biology Academy**, we emphasize **NCERT-first approach**. 95% of our teaching is NCERT line-by-line analysis.

### Student Success Story

> "I used to confuse Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) vs Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) in Nephron diagrams - got it wrong 4 times in my first 5 mock tests. The problem? I was memorizing labels without understanding their POSITION relative to Bowman's capsule. After Dr. Shekhar taught the 5-step diagram method (trace 5 times, draw 5 times, label from blank diagrams), I finally visualized the nephron structure in 3D. I practiced drawing the nephron 20+ times over 2 weeks.
>
> In NEET 2025, they asked: 'Maximum reabsorption occurs in which part of nephron?' - instant answer: PCT. Another question: 'ADH acts on which structure?' - DCT + Collecting duct. Got all 3 nephron-related questions correct.
>
> Final score: **13/15 in NEET 2025 Physiology (52 marks)** - my highest-scoring chapter! From 6-7 correct in mocks (28 marks) to 13/15 in the actual exam. The diagram practice sheets and enzyme tables were absolute game-changers."

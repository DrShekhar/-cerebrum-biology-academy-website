# Human Digestion and Absorption - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Human Physiology is the **highest weightage unit** in NEET Biology, and Digestion contributes **4-6 questions** annually. This comprehensive guide covers all NCERT concepts.

## Overview of Digestive System

**Definition:** Process of converting complex food into simple absorbable forms through mechanical and chemical breakdown.

### Components

1. **Alimentary Canal:** Mouth → Pharynx → Esophagus → Stomach → Small intestine → Large intestine → Rectum → Anus

2. **Associated Glands:** Salivary glands, Liver, Pancreas

---

## Alimentary Canal

### 1. Mouth (Buccal Cavity)

**Structures:**

- Teeth (32 in adults): I 2/2, C 1/1, PM 2/2, M 3/3 = 32
- Tongue: Taste, mixing, swallowing
- Salivary glands

**Dental Formula:**

- Adults: 2123/2123 = 32
- Children: 2102/2102 = 20 (milk teeth)

**Types of Teeth:**

| Type          | Function | Shape         |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Incisors (8)  | Cutting  | Chisel-shaped |
| Canines (4)   | Tearing  | Pointed       |
| Premolars (8) | Crushing | Flat crown    |
| Molars (12)   | Grinding | Broad crown   |

### 2. Pharynx

- Common passage for food and air
- Epiglottis prevents food entry into trachea

### 3. Esophagus (Food Pipe)

- ~25 cm long muscular tube
- No digestion occurs
- **Peristalsis:** Wave-like muscular contractions push food

### 4. Stomach

**Shape:** J-shaped muscular organ

**Regions:**

| Region  | Location             | Function           |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Cardiac | Near esophagus       | Entry of food      |
| Fundus  | Upper dome           | Temporary storage  |
| Body    | Main part            | Mixing, churning   |
| Pyloric | Near small intestine | Controlled release |

**Gastric Glands (Types of Cells):**

| Cell Type                | Secretion             | Function                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Mucous cells             | Mucus                 | Protects stomach lining              |
| Parietal (Oxyntic)       | HCl, Intrinsic factor | Activates pepsinogen, kills bacteria |
| Chief (Peptic/Zymogenic) | Pepsinogen            | Protein digestion (as pepsin)        |
| G cells                  | Gastrin               | Stimulates gastric secretion         |

**Gastric Juice Composition:**

- HCl (pH 1.5-2.5)
- Pepsinogen → Pepsin (active)
- Gastric lipase (minor fat digestion)
- Rennin/Chymosin (milk protein, mainly in infants)

### 5. Small Intestine

**Length:** ~6 meters (longest part of alimentary canal)

**Three Parts:**

| Part     | Length | Function                           |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Duodenum | ~25 cm | Receives bile and pancreatic juice |
| Jejunum  | ~2.5 m | Major digestion and absorption     |
| Ileum    | ~3.5 m | Absorption, especially B12         |

**Intestinal Glands:**

- **Crypts of Lieberkühn:** Secrete intestinal juice (succus entericus)
- **Brunner's glands:** Secrete mucus (only in duodenum)

### 6. Large Intestine

**Length:** ~1.5 meters

**Parts:** Caecum → Colon (ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid) → Rectum → Anus

**Functions:**

- Water absorption
- Electrolyte absorption
- Formation of feces
- Houses gut bacteria (vitamin synthesis)

**Vermiform Appendix:**

- Vestigial organ
- Attached to caecum
- Contains lymphoid tissue

## Digestive Glands

### 1. Salivary Glands

| Gland         | Location     | Secretion                     |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Parotid       | Below ear    | Serous (watery, amylase-rich) |
| Submandibular | Below jaw    | Mixed                         |
| Sublingual    | Below tongue | Mucous                        |

**Saliva Composition:**

- Water (99.5%)
- **Salivary amylase (ptyalin):** Starch → Maltose
- Lysozyme: Antibacterial
- Mucin: Lubrication
- pH: 6.8 (slightly acidic)

### 2. Liver (Largest Internal Organ)

**Weight:** ~1.5 kg

**Functions:**

- Bile production
- Detoxification
- Glycogen storage
- Plasma protein synthesis
- Cholesterol metabolism

**Bile:**

- Produced by hepatocytes
- Stored in gallbladder
- Released into duodenum via bile duct
- **Contains NO digestive enzymes**

**Bile Composition:**

| Component     | Function                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bile salts    | Emulsification of fats        |
| Bile pigments | Bilirubin, biliverdin (waste) |
| Cholesterol   | Excretion                     |
| Phospholipids | Emulsification                |

**NEET Important:** Bile emulsifies fats (breaks into smaller droplets) but does NOT digest them. Lipase digests fats.

### 3. Pancreas

**Type:** Both exocrine and endocrine

**Exocrine Function (Digestive):**

- Secretes pancreatic juice into duodenum
- Alkaline pH (7.8-8.2) neutralizes gastric acid

**Pancreatic Enzymes:**

| Enzyme                                   | Substrate     | Product                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Trypsinogen (→ Trypsin)                  | Proteins      | Peptides               |
| Chymotrypsinogen (→ Chymotrypsin)        | Proteins      | Peptides               |
| Procarboxypeptidase (→ Carboxypeptidase) | Peptides      | Amino acids            |
| Pancreatic amylase                       | Starch        | Maltose                |
| Pancreatic lipase                        | Fats          | Fatty acids + Glycerol |
| Nucleases                                | Nucleic acids | Nucleotides            |

**Activation:** Trypsinogen → Trypsin (by enterokinase from intestine)
Then trypsin activates other zymogens.

## FAQs

**Q: Why doesn't the stomach digest itself?**
A: The stomach is protected by: (1) thick mucus layer secreted by mucous cells, (2) bicarbonate ions in mucus neutralizing acid, and (3) rapid cell turnover replacing damaged cells.

**Q: Why is bile important even without enzymes?**
A: Bile salts emulsify fats into smaller droplets, increasing surface area for lipase action. Without bile, fat digestion is severely impaired.

**Q: What is the role of HCl in digestion?**
A: HCl (1) activates pepsinogen to pepsin, (2) provides optimal pH for pepsin (1.5-2.5), (3) kills most bacteria, and (4) denatures proteins making them easier to digest.

**Q: Why are fats absorbed differently from carbohydrates and proteins?**
A: Fatty acids and glycerol are hydrophobic. They form chylomicrons (lipoprotein particles) that are too large to enter blood capillaries directly, so they enter lacteals (lymphatic vessels) first.

**Q: What causes lactose intolerance?**
A: Lactose intolerance occurs due to deficiency of lactase enzyme. Undigested lactose passes to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas and causing bloating, cramps, and diarrhea.

# How to Score 700+ in NEET 2026: The Complete Roadmap

Scoring 700+ in NEET is not about being a genius - it's about smart strategy, consistent effort, and the right approach. Every year, thousands of students score above 700, and with the right guidance, you can too.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down exactly what it takes to join the elite 700+ club.

## Understanding the 700+ Score Requirement

### The Mathematics Behind 700+

| Metric                   | Requirement          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Total Questions          | 200 (180 to attempt) |
| Marks per correct answer | +4                   |
| Marks per wrong answer   | -1                   |
| Maximum Marks            | 720                  |
| Target Score             | 700+                 |

### Score Breakdown for 700+

| Scenario  | Correct | Wrong | Not Attempted | Score |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ------------- | ----- |
| Ideal     | 178     | 2     | 0             | 710   |
| Safe      | 180     | 5     | 0             | 715   |
| Realistic | 175     | 0     | 5             | 700   |

**Key Insight:** To score 700+, you need approximately **175-178 correct answers** with minimal negative marking.

## Subject-wise Score Distribution for 700+

### Target Scores by Subject

| Subject   | Max Marks | Target for 700+ | Accuracy Required |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Physics   | 180       | 165+            | 92%               |
| Chemistry | 180       | 170+            | 94%               |
| Biology   | 360       | 340+            | 94%               |
| **Total** | **720**   | **700+**        | **~97%**          |

### Why Biology is Your Best Friend

Biology contributes **50% of total marks** (360/720). If you can master Biology:

- Score 340+ in Biology alone
- Reduces pressure on Physics and Chemistry
- Biology is more NCERT-dependent, hence more predictable

| Focuses on completion      | Focuses on mastery               |
| Ignores weak areas         | Actively works on weak areas     |
| Panic during exam          | Calm and strategic               |

### The Non-Negotiables for 700+

1. **NCERT Mastery** - Not just reading, but memorizing key lines
2. **Consistent Practice** - Daily PYQs and mock tests
3. **Error Analysis** - Learning from every mistake
4. **Time Management** - Both in preparation and exam
5. **Physical & Mental Health** - Cannot be compromised

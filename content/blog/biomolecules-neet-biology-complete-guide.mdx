# Biomolecules - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Biomolecules chapter contributes **4-6 questions** in NEET and forms the foundation for understanding biochemistry. This guide covers all NCERT concepts essential for NEET 2026.

## Introduction to Biomolecules

Living organisms are made up of various chemical compounds called biomolecules. These can be classified as:

| Category       | Examples                                 | Characteristics                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Micromolecules | Sugars, amino acids, nucleotides         | Low molecular weight, simple    |
| Macromolecules | Proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides | High molecular weight, polymers |

**Primary vs Secondary Metabolites:**

- **Primary:** Essential for life (amino acids, sugars, fatty acids)
- **Secondary:** Not essential but provide ecological advantage (alkaloids, terpenes, pigments)

## Carbohydrates

### General Formula

Cn(H2O)n - hence the name "hydrates of carbon"

### Classification

#### 1. Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars)

| Sugar   | Carbon atoms | Example                      | Source                    |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Triose  | 3C           | Glyceraldehyde               | Glycolysis intermediate   |
| Tetrose | 4C           | Erythrose                    | Pentose phosphate pathway |
| Pentose | 5C           | Ribose, Deoxyribose          | RNA, DNA                  |
| Hexose  | 6C           | Glucose, Fructose, Galactose | Most common               |

**Important Hexoses:**

- **Glucose** (dextrose/grape sugar): Blood sugar
- **Fructose** (levulose): Sweetest natural sugar, found in fruits
- **Galactose**: Component of lactose

#### 2. Disaccharides

| Disaccharide | Components          | Bond  | Source              |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| Sucrose      | Glucose + Fructose  | α-1,2 | Sugarcane, beetroot |
| Maltose      | Glucose + Glucose   | α-1,4 | Germinating seeds   |
| Lactose      | Glucose + Galactose | β-1,4 | Milk                |

**NEET Tip:** Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar because both anomeric carbons are involved in the glycosidic bond.

#### 3. Polysaccharides

| Polysaccharide | Monomer             | Bond Type                                    | Function                      |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Starch         | α-glucose           | α-1,4 (amylose), α-1,4 & α-1,6 (amylopectin) | Plant storage                 |
| Glycogen       | α-glucose           | α-1,4 & α-1,6 (more branched)                | Animal storage                |
| Cellulose      | β-glucose           | β-1,4                                        | Plant cell wall               |
| Chitin         | N-acetylglucosamine | β-1,4                                        | Fungal cell wall, exoskeleton |

**Key Difference:** Starch and glycogen are digestible; cellulose is not (humans lack cellulase enzyme).

### Protein Structure

| Level      | Description                    | Bonds Involved                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Primary    | Linear sequence of amino acids | Peptide bonds                          |
| Secondary  | α-helix, β-pleated sheet       | Hydrogen bonds                         |
| Tertiary   | 3D folding                     | H-bonds, ionic, disulfide, hydrophobic |
| Quaternary | Multiple polypeptide chains    | Same as tertiary                       |

- Fats: Saturated (animal origin)
- Oils: Unsaturated (plant origin)

#### 2. Compound Lipids

| Type          | Components                  | Example      | Function         |

**Base Pairing Rules (Chargaff's Rules):**

- A pairs with T (2 hydrogen bonds) in DNA
- A pairs with U in RNA
- G pairs with C (3 hydrogen bonds)

### DNA vs RNA

## FAQs

**Q: Why is sucrose called a non-reducing sugar?**
A: In sucrose, both anomeric carbons (C1 of glucose and C2 of fructose) are involved in the glycosidic bond, so there's no free aldehyde or ketone group to reduce other compounds.

**Q: What makes an amino acid essential?**
A: Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body in sufficient quantities and must be obtained from the diet. There are 9 essential amino acids for adults.

**Q: Why do enzymes have optimal temperature and pH?**
A: Enzymes are proteins with specific 3D structures. Temperature and pH changes can alter hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions that maintain this structure. Beyond optimal conditions, the enzyme denatures and loses activity.

**Q: What is the difference between DNA and RNA in terms of stability?**
A: DNA is more stable because: (1) deoxyribose lacks 2'-OH making it less reactive, (2) double-stranded structure provides redundancy, (3) thymine instead of uracil prevents deamination errors.

**Q: Why is RuBisCO considered the most abundant protein?**
A: RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is found in all photosynthetic organisms and makes up about 50% of leaf protein. Given the vast amount of plant biomass on Earth, it's the most abundant protein globally.

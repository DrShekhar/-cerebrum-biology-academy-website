2. **Bring originals** - Photocopies alone won't work
3. **Self-attest copies** - Sign on each copy
4. **Carry extra photographs** - 10 minimum
5. **Keep file organized** - Sequence as per checklist

## Step 4: Choice Filling

### Understanding Choice Filling

Choice filling is where you **rank colleges in order of preference**. The system allots based on:
1. Your NEET rank
2. Your category
3. Your preference order

### Choice Filling Strategy

**Golden Rule:** Fill colleges in order of YOUR preference, NOT by cutoff.

**Example:**

| Your Preference | Last Year Cutoff | Fill Order |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| SKNMC Pune | 70,000 | 1st |
| MGM Navi Mumbai | 65,000 | 2nd |
| Terna | 78,000 | 3rd |

Even if MGM has better cutoff, if you prefer SKNMC, fill SKNMC first.

### How Many Choices to Fill?

| Your Rank | Recommended Choices |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Under 30,000 | 15-20 colleges |
| 30,000-60,000 | 25-30 colleges |
| 60,000-1,00,000 | 35-40 colleges |
| Above 1,00,000 | All available colleges |

### Choice Filling Tips

1. **Research thoroughly** - Know each college
2. **Include safety options** - 5-10 colleges above your expected cutoff
3. **Location matters** - Consider travel, living costs
4. **Check fee structure** - Can you afford all choices?
5. **Don't leave gaps** - Fill continuously

### Common Choice Filling Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Filling by cutoff only | May get unwanted college |
| Too few choices | Risk of no allotment |
| Ignoring affordable colleges | Miss good opportunities |
| Not locking choices | Choices won't be considered |
| Last-minute filling | Errors due to rush |

## Step 5: Seat Allotment

### Allotment Algorithm

1. System processes from Rank 1 downwards
2. For each candidate, checks choices in order
3. Allots first available choice where seat exists
4. If no seat available, candidate goes to next round

### Round-by-Round Process

**Round 1:**
- First allotment based on choices
- Best opportunity to get preferred college
- Must report if satisfied

**Round 2:**
- For candidates not allotted or seeking upgrade
- Based on vacant seats from Round 1
- Can retain Round 1 seat while seeking upgrade

**Round 3 (Mop-up):**
- Final major round
- All vacant seats from Round 1 & 2
- Often last chance for many colleges

**Stray Vacancy:**
- Leftover seats after mop-up
- Quick allotment (often same day)
- Very limited choices

### After Allotment - What to Do?

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Satisfied with allotment | Report to college, pay fees |
| Want upgrade | Retain seat + participate in next round |
| Not satisfied at all | Don't report, participate in next round |
| No allotment | Wait for next round |

## Step 6: College Reporting

### Reporting Process

**Within 5 days of allotment:**

1. **Visit allotted college**
2. **Submit documents** (originals)
3. **Pay admission fee**
4. **Collect admission letter**
5. **Join classes**

### Documents for Reporting

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| DMER Allotment Letter | Proof of allotment |
| NEET Scorecard (original) | Verification |
| All academic certificates | Admission |
| Fee payment receipt | Confirmation |
| Character certificate | College record |
| Medical fitness certificate | College requirement |

### Fee Payment at Reporting

| Component | Typical Amount |
|-----------|----------------|
| Admission Fee | Rs 50,000 - 1,00,000 |
| Tuition (1st installment) | 50% of annual |
| Hostel (if applicable) | Full year often |

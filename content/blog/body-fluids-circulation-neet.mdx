# Body Fluids and Circulation - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Body Fluids and Circulation is one of the most important chapters in Human Physiology, contributing **5-7 questions** in NEET annually. This comprehensive guide covers all NCERT concepts.

## Body Fluids

### Types of Body Fluids

| Fluid | Location | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Blood | Cardiovascular system | Transport, defense, regulation |
| Lymph | Lymphatic system | Immunity, fat absorption |
| Tissue fluid | Between cells | Nutrient/waste exchange |

---

## Blood

### Composition of Blood

**Blood = Plasma (55%) + Formed Elements (45%)**

### Plasma

**Composition:**
- Water: 90-92%
- Proteins: 6-8%
- Inorganic salts: 0.9%
- Other substances: Glucose, hormones, gases, waste

**Plasma Proteins:**

| Protein | Percentage | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Albumin | 60% | Osmotic pressure, transport |
| Globulins | 35% | Immunity (γ), transport (α, β) |
| Fibrinogen | 4% | Blood clotting |
| Prothrombin | <1% | Blood clotting |

**Serum = Plasma - Clotting factors (Fibrinogen)**

### Formed Elements

#### 1. Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Shape | Biconcave disc |
| Nucleus | Absent (in mammals) |
| Count | 5-5.5 million/μL (males), 4.5-5 million/μL (females) |
| Lifespan | 120 days |
| Formation | Red bone marrow (Erythropoiesis) |
| Destruction | Spleen (graveyard of RBCs) |
| Contains | Hemoglobin (~270 million/RBC) |

**Hemoglobin:**
- 4 polypeptide chains (2α + 2β in adults)
- 4 heme groups (each with Fe²⁺)
- Each Hb binds 4 O₂ molecules

**Erythropoiesis regulation:** Hypoxia → Kidney releases Erythropoietin → ↑ RBC production

#### 2. White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)

**Count:** 6,000-8,000/μL

**Types:**

| Type | Percentage | Nucleus | Granules | Function |
|------|------------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Granulocytes** | | | | |
| Neutrophils | 60-65% | Multi-lobed | Fine, light | Phagocytosis (bacteria) |
| Eosinophils | 2-3% | Bi-lobed | Coarse, red | Parasites, allergies |
| Basophils | 0.5-1% | S-shaped | Large, blue | Histamine, heparin |
| **Agranulocytes** | | | | |
| Lymphocytes | 20-25% | Round, large | None | Immunity (B and T cells) |
| Monocytes | 6-8% | Kidney-shaped | None | Phagocytosis (→ macrophages) |

**Mnemonic:** Never Let Monkeys Eat Bananas (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils - decreasing order)

#### 3. Platelets (Thrombocytes)

### Blood Groups

#### ABO System

| Blood Group | Antigen on RBC | Antibody in Plasma | Can Donate To | Can Receive From |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| A | A | Anti-B | A, AB | A, O |
| B | B | Anti-A | B, AB | B, O |
| AB | A and B | None | AB only | All (Universal recipient) |
| O | None | Anti-A, Anti-B | All (Universal donor) | O only |

#### Rh System

- **Rh+ (85%):** Has Rh antigen (D antigen)
- **Rh- (15%):** Lacks Rh antigen

**Erythroblastosis fetalis:** Rh- mother + Rh+ fetus → Mother develops anti-Rh antibodies → Destroys fetal RBCs in subsequent Rh+ pregnancies

### Blood Clotting (Coagulation)

**Three Stages:**

1. **Formation of Thromboplastin:**
   - Damaged tissues release tissue factor
   - Platelets release platelet factors
   - Ca²⁺ required

2. **Formation of Thrombin:**
   Prothrombin → Thrombin (by Thromboplastin + Ca²⁺)

3. **Formation of Fibrin:**
   Fibrinogen → Fibrin (by Thrombin)
   Fibrin mesh traps blood cells → Clot

**Anticoagulants:**
- Heparin (from mast cells, basophils)
- EDTA, Citrate (used in blood banks - chelate Ca²⁺)

---

## Lymph

**Composition:** Similar to blood but lacks RBCs and most proteins

**Functions:**
1. Returns tissue fluid to blood
2. Transports absorbed fats (lacteals)
3. Carries lymphocytes
4. Filters pathogens (lymph nodes)

---

## Circulatory System

### Types of Circulation

| Type | Organism | Characteristics |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Open | Arthropods, Molluscs | Blood bathes organs directly |
| Closed | Annelids, Vertebrates | Blood flows in vessels |

### Double Circulation

Blood passes through heart twice per complete circuit:
1. **Pulmonary circulation:** Heart → Lungs → Heart
2. **Systemic circulation:** Heart → Body → Heart

---

## Human Heart

### Location and Structure

- Located in thoracic cavity, mediastinum
- Size: Fist-sized (~300 g)
- Covered by double-walled pericardium

### Chambers and Vessels

| Chamber | Receives Blood From | Sends Blood To |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Right Atrium | Superior & Inferior Vena Cava | Right Ventricle |
| Right Ventricle | Right Atrium | Pulmonary Artery |
| Left Atrium | Pulmonary Veins (4) | Left Ventricle |
| Left Ventricle | Left Atrium | Aorta |

**Wall Thickness:** Left ventricle > Right ventricle > Atria

### Valves

| Valve | Location | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Tricuspid | RA-RV junction | Prevents backflow to RA |
| Bicuspid (Mitral) | LA-LV junction | Prevents backflow to LA |
| Pulmonary semilunar | RV-Pulmonary artery | Prevents backflow to RV |
| Aortic semilunar | LV-Aorta | Prevents backflow to LV |

### Conducting System

**Components (in order of conduction):**

1. **SA Node (Sinoatrial Node)**
   - Location: Right atrium, near SVC opening
   - Pacemaker (generates impulses at 70-75/min)
   - Rate: Highest intrinsic rate

2. **AV Node (Atrioventricular Node)**
   - Location: Right atrium, near AV septum
   - Delays impulse (0.1 sec) - allows atrial emptying
   - Rate: 40-60/min

3. **Bundle of His (AV Bundle)**
   - Passes through AV septum
   - Divides into right and left bundle branches

4. **Purkinje Fibers**
   - Spread throughout ventricular walls
   - Rapid conduction to ventricular muscle

**Autorhythmicity:** Heart can generate its own impulses (no nerve required)

## Cardiac Cycle

**Definition:** Sequence of events from one heartbeat to the next

**Duration:** 0.8 seconds (at 75 beats/min)

### Phases

| Phase | Duration | Events |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Atrial systole | 0.1 s | Atria contract, AV valves open, blood enters ventricles |
| Ventricular systole | 0.3 s | Ventricles contract, AV valves close, semilunar valves open |
| Joint diastole | 0.4 s | All chambers relax, semilunar valves close, blood fills atria |

### Pressure and Volume Changes

**End Diastolic Volume (EDV):** ~120 mL (blood in ventricle after filling)
**End Systolic Volume (ESV):** ~50 mL (blood remaining after ejection)
**Stroke Volume (SV):** EDV - ESV = 70 mL

**Cardiac Output = Heart Rate × Stroke Volume**
= 75 × 70 = 5250 mL/min ≈ 5 L/min

### Heart Sounds

| Sound | Cause | Phase |
|-------|-------|-------|
| First (Lub) | AV valves closing | Start of ventricular systole |
| Second (Dub) | Semilunar valves closing | Start of diastole |

---

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

**Definition:** Graphical record of electrical activity of heart

### Waves and Intervals

| Component | Represents | Duration |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| P wave | Atrial depolarization | 0.08 s |
| QRS complex | Ventricular depolarization | 0.08 s |
| T wave | Ventricular repolarization | 0.16 s |
| PR interval | AV conduction time | 0.12-0.2 s |
| QT interval | Ventricular activity | 0.4 s |

**Note:** Atrial repolarization is hidden within QRS complex

### Clinical Significance

| Abnormality | Indication |
|-------------|------------|
| Prolonged PR interval | AV block |
| Wide QRS | Bundle branch block |
| ST elevation | Myocardial infarction |
| Irregular rhythm | Arrhythmia |

## Regulation of Cardiac Activity

### Neural Regulation

| Nerve | Effect | Neurotransmitter |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Vagus (Parasympathetic) | ↓ Heart rate | Acetylcholine |
| Sympathetic | ↑ Heart rate, ↑ Force | Norepinephrine |

### Hormonal Regulation

| Hormone | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Adrenaline | ↑ Heart rate, ↑ Force |
| Thyroxine | ↑ Heart rate |

## Blood Vessels

### Types

| Vessel | Wall Structure | Function |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Arteries | Thick, elastic, muscular | Carry blood away from heart |
| Veins | Thin, less muscular, have valves | Carry blood to heart |
| Capillaries | Single layer endothelium | Exchange of materials |

### Blood Pressure

**Normal:** 120/80 mm Hg (Systolic/Diastolic)

| Condition | Systolic | Diastolic |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Normal | <120 | <80 |

## FAQs

**Q: Why is SA node called the pacemaker?**
A: SA node generates impulses at the highest rate (70-75/min) among all conducting tissues. It sets the rhythm for the entire heart, hence called the pacemaker.

**Q: Why is left ventricle wall thicker than right ventricle?**
A: Left ventricle pumps blood to the entire body (systemic circulation) against higher resistance, requiring more force. Right ventricle only pumps to nearby lungs (pulmonary circulation) at lower pressure.

**Q: What happens if the AV node fails?**
A: If SA node fails, AV node can take over as pacemaker (at 40-60 beats/min). If AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers can maintain a very slow rhythm (25-40/min), but this is not sustainable.

**Q: Why do arteries not have valves but veins do?**
A: Arteries receive high-pressure blood directly from the heart, which maintains unidirectional flow. Veins carry low-pressure blood against gravity (especially from legs), so valves prevent backflow.

**Q: What is the significance of the delay at AV node?**
A: The 0.1-second delay allows complete atrial contraction and ventricular filling before ventricles contract. Without this delay, atria and ventricles would contract simultaneously, reducing cardiac efficiency.

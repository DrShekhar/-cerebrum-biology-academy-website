# Neural Control and Coordination - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Neural Control and Coordination is one of the most important and high-weightage chapters, contributing **5-7 questions** in NEET annually. This comprehensive guide covers all NCERT concepts.

## Introduction to Neural System

**Definition:** The system that controls and coordinates body activities through rapid electrical signals.

### Organization of Neural System

**Central Nervous System (CNS):**

- Brain

## Neuron - Structural and Functional Unit

### Structure of Neuron

**Three Main Parts:**

#### 1. Cell Body (Soma/Cyton)

- Contains nucleus and most organelles
- Nissl granules (rough ER) - protein synthesis
- Site of metabolic activity

#### 2. Dendrites

- Short, branched processes
- Receive signals from other neurons
- Conduct impulse toward cell body

#### 3. Axon

- Single, long process
- Conducts impulse away from cell body
- May be myelinated or unmyelinated
- Ends in terminal buttons (synaptic knobs)

### Myelin Sheath

| Feature          | Myelinated         | Unmyelinated        |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Myelin           | Present            | Absent              |
| Nodes of Ranvier | Present            | Absent              |
| Conduction       | Saltatory (faster) | Continuous (slower) |
| Speed            | 100-120 m/s        | 0.5-2 m/s           |
| Location         | White matter, PNS  | Gray matter         |

**Myelin in CNS:** Oligodendrocytes
**Myelin in PNS:** Schwann cells

### Types of Neurons

| Type               | Structure                 | Function                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Sensory (Afferent) | Long dendrite, short axon | Carry impulse to CNS       |
| Motor (Efferent)   | Short dendrite, long axon | Carry impulse from CNS     |
| Interneurons       | Short processes           | Connect neurons within CNS |

| Based on Processes | Number of Processes         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Unipolar           | 1 (axon only)               |
| Bipolar            | 2 (1 dendrite, 1 axon)      |
| Multipolar         | 3+ (many dendrites, 1 axon) |

## Nerve Impulse

### Resting Membrane Potential

**Value:** -70 mV (inside negative relative to outside)

**Maintenance:**

- Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump: 3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in
- High K⁺ inside, High Na⁺ outside
- K⁺ leak channels maintain negativity

### Generation of Action Potential

**Stimulus → Threshold (-55 mV) → Action Potential**

| Phase             | Events                               | Potential    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Resting           | Na⁺/K⁺ pump maintains gradient       | -70 mV       |
| Depolarization    | Na⁺ channels open, Na⁺ rushes in     | -70 → +30 mV |
| Repolarization    | Na⁺ channels close, K⁺ channels open | +30 → -70 mV |
| Hyperpolarization | K⁺ channels slow to close            | Below -70 mV |
| Return to resting | Na⁺/K⁺ pump restores gradient        | -70 mV       |

### Properties of Action Potential

**All-or-None Law:** Action potential either occurs fully or not at all; no partial response.

**Refractory Period:**

- **Absolute:** No stimulus can generate another AP
- **Relative:** Only strong stimulus can generate AP

### Conduction of Nerve Impulse

| Type       | Mechanism                      | Speed  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Continuous | Sequential depolarization      | Slower |
| Saltatory  | Jumps between Nodes of Ranvier | Faster |

---

## Synapse

**Definition:** Junction between two neurons where signal transmission occurs.

### Types of Synapses

| Type       | Mechanism                      | Speed     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Electrical | Gap junctions, direct ion flow | Very fast |
| Chemical   | Neurotransmitter release       | Slower    |

### Structure of Chemical Synapse

1. **Presynaptic terminal:** Contains synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters
2. **Synaptic cleft:** 20-40 nm gap
3. **Postsynaptic membrane:** Contains receptors

### Synaptic Transmission

1. Action potential reaches axon terminal
2. Ca²⁺ channels open, Ca²⁺ enters
3. Synaptic vesicles fuse with membrane
4. Neurotransmitter released into synaptic cleft
5. NT binds to receptors on postsynaptic membrane
6. Ion channels open/close on postsynaptic neuron
7. NT removed (reuptake, enzyme degradation, diffusion)

### Common Neurotransmitters

| Neurotransmitter | Location       | Effect                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Acetylcholine    | NMJ, brain     | Excitatory/Inhibitory |
| Norepinephrine   | Sympathetic NS | Excitatory            |
| Dopamine         | Brain          | Pleasure, movement    |
| Serotonin        | Brain          | Mood, sleep           |
| GABA             | Brain          | Inhibitory            |
| Glutamate        | Brain          | Excitatory            |

## FAQs

**Q: Why is the resting potential negative?**
A: The Na⁺/K⁺ pump creates an ionic gradient (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in). Additionally, K⁺ leak channels allow K⁺ to diffuse out, leaving the inside more negative relative to outside.

**Q: What is the advantage of saltatory conduction?**
A: In myelinated neurons, action potential jumps between Nodes of Ranvier instead of traveling continuously. This is faster (100 m/s vs 1 m/s) and more energy-efficient.

**Q: Why is the cerebellum called the "little brain"?**
A: It has a similar folded structure to the cerebrum but is smaller. Despite being only 10% of brain volume, it contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined.

**Q: What happens if the corpus callosum is cut?**
A: This procedure (commissurotomy) prevents communication between hemispheres. Patients can function normally in daily life but show "split-brain" effects in specific tests.

**Q: Why does Parkinson's disease cause tremors?**
A: Parkinson's involves death of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Dopamine is essential for smooth, coordinated movements, so its deficiency causes tremors and rigidity.

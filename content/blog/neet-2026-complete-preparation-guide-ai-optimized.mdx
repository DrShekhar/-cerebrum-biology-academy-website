## 15 Most Frequently Asked Questions About NEET 2026

### Question 1: What is the minimum score to qualify NEET 2026?

**Answer**: Based on 5-year trends, cutoff to qualify is typically:
- General Category: 145-160 marks (50th percentile)
- OBC: 140-145 marks
- SC/ST: 105-120 marks

**However**, qualifying is not enough. For government MBBS seat (top 15,000 ranks), you need 600+ minimum. For private medical colleges, 550+ is usually considered good.

---

### Question 2: Is NCERT enough for NEET, or do I need reference books?

**Answer**: NCERT is 70-75% sufficient. You need one reference book for:
- Additional practice (NCERT examples are limited)
- Advanced questions
- Alternative explanations for difficult topics

**Dr. Shekhar's Recommendation**:
- Biology: NCERT + MTG (for practice)
- Physics: NCERT + H.C. Verma (for concepts)
- Chemistry: NCERT + Coaching material

---

### Question 3: How many hours per day should I study for NEET 2026?

**Answer**: It depends on your starting point:

- **Beginners (Class 10 level)**: 5-6 hours/day
- **Average students (50% syllabus done)**: 6-8 hours/day
- **Advanced students (80% done)**: 6-7 hours/day
- **Last 30 days**: 4-5 hours/day (quality over quantity)

**Key Point**: 7 hours focused study > 12 hours distracted study

Quality matters more than quantity. Focused 6 hours with zero distractions > 10 hours with phone interruptions.

---

### Question 4: Should I join coaching, or is self-study sufficient?

**Answer**: Based on 5-year data at Cerebrum:

| Category | Self-Study Success | With Coaching Success |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Beginners | 15-20% (600+) | 55-60% (600+) |
| Average Students | 30-35% (600+) | 65-70% (600+) |
| Advanced Students | 50-60% (600+) | 75-80% (600+) |

**Factors to consider**:
- Your discipline level
- Your self-motivation
- Quality of self-study material
- Access to doubt resolution
- Peer competition needs

**Dr. Shekhar's View**: Coaching helps 60% due to structure and doubt resolution, but 40% depends on your effort. A motivated self-studier can outperform unmotivated coached student.

---

### Question 5: What is the cutoff for different colleges in 2026?

**Answer**: Expected 2026 cutoffs (Based on 2025 trends):

| College Type | Cutoff Marks | Expected Rank |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| AIIMS Delhi | 690+ | Top 100 |
| AIIMS Across India | 670+ | Top 500 |
| Top Government MBBS (Delhi, UP, etc.) | 620-650 | Top 5,000 |
| Average Government MBBS | 550-600 | Top 15,000 |
| Top Private Medical Colleges | 580-620 | Top 10,000 |
| Average Private Medical Colleges | 450-550 | Top 50,000 |

**Note**: These are estimates. Actual cutoffs vary by state, category, and reservation.

---

### Question 6: What are the most difficult chapters in NEET?

**Answer**: Based on student feedback (10,000+ students):

**Hardest Chapters** (Highest failure rate):
1. Genetics (Molecular Basis of Inheritance) - 30% score
2. Plant Physiology (Photosynthesis) - 35% score
3. Physics: Current Electricity - 40% score
4. Chemistry: Organic Chemistry (Complex mechanisms) - 40% score

**Strategy for Difficult Chapters**:
- Start 4 weeks early
- Use video explanations
- Solve 100+ problems
- Take mentorship help
- Revise 5-6 times minimum

---

### Question 7: Can I prepare for NEET in 3-4 months?

**Answer**: Yes, but with conditions:

**Possible if**:
- You've already studied 70% syllabus (Class 12 ongoing)
- You're highly disciplined (9-10 hours/day)
- You have good coaching/mentorship
- You have very high baseline intelligence

**Expected Score Range**: 500-600 (Not sufficient for good college)

**Better Approach**: Start 9-12 months in advance:
- 6-month intensive: 550-600 score range
- 12-month preparation: 650+ score range

---

### Question 8: Is solving previous year questions important?

**Answer**: ABSOLUTELY YES. This is non-negotiable.

**Why**:
- 30-40% questions repeat from previous 5 years (in concept if not exact)
- Understand question patterns and difficulty level
- Time management practice

**How to solve PYQ**:
1. Solve topic-wise first (after chapter completion)
2. Then solve year-wise (full papers)
3. Time yourself
4. Analyze why you got wrong answers

**Years to solve**: Minimum last 10 years (2015-2025)

---

### Question 9: How important is mock testing for NEET?

**Answer**: Mock tests are 40% of your success (rest 60% is preparation).

**Why Mock Tests Matter**:
- Identify weak areas

- Get actual percentile feedback

**Recommended Mock Test Schedule**:
- Month 1-2: None
- Month 3-4: 1 mock every 2 weeks (4-5 mocks total)

- Final month: 1 mock every 3 days (8-10 mocks)

**Total**: Minimum 20-25 mock tests before exam

### Question 10: What should be my strategy for negative marking?

**Answer**: Negative marking is your biggest advantage or disadvantage.

**The Math**:
- 200 questions = 50 correct + 50 wrong = 150 marks left = 550 total (55%)
- 200 questions = 150 correct + 20 wrong = 30 left = 580 total (80%)

**Strategy**:
- Skip unknown questions (don't guess randomly)
- If 60% confident, attempt
- If 40% confident, leave
- Biology: Attempt more (easier, higher confidence)
- Physics: Leave more (harder, lower confidence)

**Dr. Shekhar's Rule**: 1 wrong answer = Loss of 5 marks (4 + 1 negative). Skip when unsure.

### Question 11: What is the best time management strategy during NEET exam?

**Answer**: Time = 3 hours 20 minutes ÷ 200 questions = 1 minute per question (MAX)

**Section-wise Allocation** (Recommended):
- **Biology (100 Qs)**: 60 minutes (36 seconds per question - Easy)
- **Chemistry (50 Qs)**: 50 minutes (1 minute per question - Medium)
- **Physics (50 Qs)**: 45 minutes (54 seconds per question - But you'll skip some)
- **Review + Revisit**: 5 minutes

**Intelligent Time Allocation**:
- Attempt easy 40% questions: 30 minutes
- Attempt medium 50% questions: 70 minutes
- Attempt hard 10% questions: 15 minutes
- Buffer: 5 minutes

**Key**: Attempt high-accuracy questions first (usually early), leave hard ones (usually at end)

### Question 12: How do I manage exam anxiety on NEET day?

**Answer**: 70% of NEET success is mental, 30% is preparation.

**Pre-Exam (1 week before)**:

- Revision only (no new learning)
- Yoga/meditation: 20 minutes daily
- Exercise: 30 minutes daily

**Day Before Exam**:

### Question 14: How do I score maximum in Biology (180+)?

**Answer**: Biology is the most scorable subject - 90% accuracy is possible.

**Why Biology is Scorable**:
- Questions are direct (less calculation-heavy)
- NCERT covers 95% of questions
- Less ambiguity than Physics/Chemistry
- Clear answer choices

**Scoring 180+ Strategy**:
1. **Complete NCERT**: Read 3 times minimum
2. **Diagram Practice**: Draw diagrams 50+ times
3. **PYQ Focus**: Solve 10 years PYQ (highest repetition in biology)
4. **Selective Reference**: Use only 1 reference book
5. **Mock Tests**: Score 170+ in biology mocks consistently

**Dr. Shekhar's Students (Average: 175 in Biology)**:
- Focus: 50% NCERT reading, 30% diagrams, 20% PYQ
- Revision: 2 hours weekly (even in final month)
- Most repeated concepts: Cell division, Photosynthesis, Reproduction, Ecology

### Question 15: Should I attempt NEET while in Class 12, or wait until Class 12 is complete?

**Answer**: Depends on your board exams weight in your state:

**Recommended**:
- **Light Board Exam states** (Weight < 30%): Attempt in Class 12 (February-May)
- **Heavy Board Exam states** (Weight > 40%): Attempt as dropper (After Class 12)
- **Medium states**: Attempt as dropper in next April (Better score probability)

**Data at Cerebrum**:
- Class 12 appearing: 580 avg (Divided focus)
- Class 12 completed: 665 avg (Full focus)
- **Advantage of waiting**: +85 marks on average

**However**: If you're very advanced (already done 90% syllabus), attempt in Class 12.

## Final Advice from Dr. Shekhar

Over the past 15 years, I've trained 5,000+ NEET aspirants. The ones who scored 650+ had these traits in common:

1. **Consistency**: They studied every single day (even weekends)
2. **Focus**: One chapter at a time, no jumping
3. **Discipline**: Followed study plan rigorously
4. **Analysis**: Every mock test was analyzed deeply
5. **Positivity**: They didn't give up after failures
6. **Health**: They exercised, slept well, ate nutritious food
7. **Support**: They had mentors, family support, or peer group

**Remember**: NEET is not IQ test; it's persistence test. If you study systematically for 9-12 months, 600+ is guaranteed. 650+ requires extra effort, but it's very achievable.

**Your success story starts today. Let's make it happen!**

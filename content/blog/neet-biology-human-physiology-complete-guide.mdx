## Why Human Physiology Is Your Highest-ROI Chapter

Most NEET toppers have the same pattern: They score 90%+ in Human Physiology while others score 50-70%.

The difference isn't more study time. It's deeper understanding of *how systems work*.

Human Physiology accounts for **60-75 marks out of 360 total** in NEET Biology (17-20%). It's the second-largest block after Plant Physiology (which is harder and less consistent).

Here's the critical insight: **Physiology is teachable.** Unlike Ecology (which is highly unpredictable) or Evolution (which is conceptually complex), Physiology has clear patterns, repeatable mechanisms, and predictable question types.

This guide maps every Physiology chapter with:
- Exact NEET weightage from 2024-2025 papers
- Question-type patterns
- Scoring strategy for each chapter
- Common misconceptions that lose marks

Use this to go from 50/75 to 70/75 in Physiology. That's +20 marks overall.

## Overview: Human Physiology Chapters & Weightage

**Total Physiology Marks: 60-75 (17-20% of Biology)**

| Chapter | Marks (Est.) | Question Count | Difficulty | Your Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Digestion & Absorption | 8-10 | 2-3 | Medium | HIGH |
| Respiration & Gas Exchange | 8-10 | 2-3 | Medium | HIGH |
| Body Fluids & Circulation | 8-10 | 2-3 | Medium-High | HIGH |
| Excretion & Osmoregulation | 8-10 | 2-3 | High | HIGH |
| Locomotion & Movement | 6-8 | 1-2 | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Neural Coordination | 10-12 | 3-4 | High | CRITICAL |
| Chemical Coordination | 8-10 | 2-3 | Medium-High | HIGH |
| **TOTAL** | **60-75** | **18-21** | | |

**Key Insight:** Neural Coordination and Chemical Coordination combined = 18-22 marks = 25% of Physiology. If you struggle here, your Physiology score crashes.

## Chapter 1: Digestion and Absorption (8-10 Marks)

### Weightage Analysis:
- 2024 NEET: 10 marks (3 questions)
- 2023 NEET: 8 marks (2 questions)
- Average: 9 marks
- Trend: Relatively consistent

### Key Concepts to Master:

#### 1. Saliva and Oral Digestion
**What NEET Asks:**
- Composition of saliva (amylase, mucus, buffering agents)
- Action of salivary amylase on starch
- Iodine test for starch digestion

**Concept Map:**
```
Saliva (secreted by salivary glands)
├─ Salivary amylase (breaks starch → maltose)
├─ Lingual lipase (minor fat digestion)
├─ Mucus (lubrication)
└─ Buffering agents (maintain pH 6.5-7)
```

**Key Mechanism:**
- Salivary amylase works optimally at pH 6.8
- Stomach acid (pH 1.5) denatures amylase
- Therefore, salivary digestion is *only in mouth* (10-15 seconds)
- This is why food must be chewed thoroughly

**Common Mistake:** Students think saliva continues to act in stomach. False. Acid destroys amylase.

#### 2. Stomach: Proteins & HCl
**What NEET Asks:**
- Gastric juice composition
- Activation of pepsinogen → pepsin
- Why HCl doesn't digest stomach wall

**Mechanism Question Type:**
"Why is pepsinogen secreted instead of pepsin?"
Answer: Pepsinogen (inactive) prevents self-digestion. HCl converts it to pepsin (active) only when needed. Once in acidic stomach, pepsin can't damage its own producing cells (peptic chief cells are protected by mucus layer).

**Key Concept:**
- Gastric juice = HCl + Pepsinogen + Mucus + Gastric lipase
- Only proteins undergo initial digestion (20% complete)
- Carbs and fats: minimal digestion here

**Mnemonic:** HCL = "Help Cells Liquefy" (stomach churns food into semi-liquid chyme)

#### 3. Pancreatic Juice and Small Intestine Digestion
**What NEET Asks:**
- Pancreatic enzyme specificity
- Intestinal pH maintenance
- Bile's role (not pancreatic, but tested together)

**Complete Digestion Location:**

| Nutrient | Where Digested | Which Enzyme | Final Product |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Carbs | Small intestine | Pancreatic amylase, disaccharidases | Monosaccharides |
| Proteins | Small intestine (mainly) | Trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase | Amino acids |
| Fats | Small intestine | Pancreatic lipase | Fatty acids + Glycerol |

**Critical Concept: Emulsification vs Digestion**
- Bile *emulsifies* fats (breaks into droplets; increases surface area)
- Pancreatic lipase *digests* emulsified fats
- Without bile, fats remain clumped; lipase can't access them
- Therefore, bile is essential for fat digestion

**Question Type:** "A patient has bile duct blockage. Which nutrient is most affected?"
Answer: Fats (lipids). Carbs and proteins still digested relatively normally.

#### 4. Absorption in Small Intestine
**What NEET Asks:**
- Structure suited for absorption (villi, microvilli)
- Absorption mechanisms (active transport for glucose, amino acids; passive for fatty acids)
- Portal blood carries absorbed nutrients to liver

**Surface Area Calculation (common NEET question):**
- Small intestine length: ~6 meters
- Villi per cm: ~30
- Microvilli per villus: ~600
- Effective surface area: **250-400 sq meters** (like a tennis court inside your belly!)

This massive surface area = maximum absorption efficiency.

**Mechanism Type Question:** "Why are amino acids absorbed by active transport while fatty acids by passive transport?"
Answer: Amino acids are polar, charged (can't cross lipid membrane); need carrier proteins + ATP. Fatty acids are nonpolar (can cross lipid directly).

#### 5. Faeces Composition
**What NEET Asks:**
- What's in faeces?
- Is starch in faeces abnormal?
- Dietary fiber role

**Common Confusion:** Students think faeces = undigested food only. Actually:
- 75% faeces = dead bacteria + intestinal cells
- 20% = indigestible fiber
- 5% = water

Presence of starch in faeces = pancreatic insufficiency (not producing amylase).

### Digestion Chapter Strategy:

**Days 1-3:** Memorize organs, juices, enzymes (NCERT table)
**Days 4-6:** Understand mechanisms (why each enzyme, where it works, what it produces)
**Days 7-8:** Clinical applications (bile duct blockage → fat malabsorption; pancreatic insufficiency → starch in faeces)
**Days 9-10:** Solve 20 NEET-style questions (focus on mechanism-based)

**Expected Accuracy:** 85-90% in exams

## Chapter 2: Breathing and Gas Exchange (8-10 Marks)

### Weightage Analysis:
- 2024 NEET: 10 marks (3 questions)
- 2023 NEET: 8 marks (2 questions)
- Average: 9 marks
- Trend: Consistent; some years 12 marks

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. Respiratory Anatomy
**What NEET Asks:**
- Larynx structure and function
- Trachea, bronchi, bronchioles organization
- Alveolar structure and wall composition

**Critical Detail: Alveolar Wall**
- Walls composed of: Simple squamous epithelium (alveolar cells) + capillary endothelium
- Only 0.5 micrometers thick (permits rapid gas diffusion)
- Alveolar macrophages (clear pathogens)
- Surfactant (reduces surface tension; allows alveolar expansion)

**Question Type:** "A premature infant has respiratory distress syndrome. Why?"
Answer: Insufficient surfactant → alveoli collapse → cannot expand → hypoxia. (Babies produce surfactant only after 34 weeks gestation.)

#### 2. Pulmonary Volumes and Capacities
**NEET Loves This Topic — Know Every Number:**

| Volume/Capacity | Amount | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Tidal Volume (TV) | 500 mL | Normal breath |
| Inspiratory Reserve (IRV) | 3000 mL | Maximum inhalation after normal breath |
| Expiratory Reserve (ERV) | 1000 mL | Maximum exhalation after normal breath |
| Residual Volume (RV) | 1200 mL | Air left in lungs (can't exhale) |
| **Total Lung Capacity (TLC)** | **5700 mL** | TV+IRV+ERV+RV |
| Vital Capacity (VC) | 4500 mL | TV+IRV+ERV (exhale-able air) |
| Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) | 2200 mL | ERV+RV (air after normal exhalation) |

**Mnemonic:** "TIRE + RV = TLC"
- TIRE = Tidal, Inspiratory Reserve, Expiratory Reserve
- Add RV (Residual) = Total Lung Capacity

**Question Type:** "A patient has emphysema (alveoli destroyed). Which volume increases most?"
Answer: Residual Volume (destroyed alveoli trap air; can't expel).

#### 3. Gas Exchange Mechanism
**Concept:** Diffusion across concentration gradient

**Oxygen Transport:**
- O₂ diffuses into blood
- Binds to hemoglobin (Hb + O₂ → HbO₂)
- Each hemoglobin can bind 4 O₂ molecules (four subunits)
- 100 mL blood carries ~20 mL O₂ when fully saturated

**Carbon Dioxide Transport:**
- CO₂ diffuses into blood (3 ways):
  1. Dissolves in plasma (5%)
  2. Binds to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin (5%)
  3. Converted to HCO₃⁻ (90%) — *most important*

**Mechanism:** CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
(Catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase inside RBCs)

**Question Type:** "Why does CO₂ transport in blood increase with exercise?"
Answer: Exercise → more CO₂ production → more H⁺ production → pH drops → Bohr effect (Hb releases O₂ more readily) AND HCO₃⁻ formation increases.

#### 4. Regulation of Respiration
**What NEET Asks:**
- Respiratory centers (medulla, pons)
- Chemoreceptors (central and peripheral)
- Effect of CO₂, O₂, H⁺ on breathing rate

**Mechanism:** Increased CO₂ (or decreased pH) → stimulates chemoreceptors → increases breathing rate → CO₂ expelled → pH normalizes

**Critical Concept:** Breathing is primarily controlled by **CO₂ level**, not O₂ level (paradoxically).
- O₂ must drop to <60 mmHg to significantly increase breathing
- CO₂ increase of just 2% significantly increases breathing

**Question Type:** "High-altitude climbers experience hyperventilation. Why?"
Answer: Low O₂ stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors → increased breathing → CO₂ expelled → respiratory alkalosis.

### Breathing Chapter Strategy:

**Days 1-2:** Learn all volumes, capacities, normal values
**Days 3-4:** Understand gas exchange mechanisms (O₂ and CO₂ transport)
**Days 5-6:** Respiration regulation (centers, chemoreceptors, effects)
**Days 7-8:** Clinical applications (emphysema, asthma, high altitude)
**Days 9-10:** Solve 20 NEET questions

**Expected Accuracy:** 85-90%

## Chapter 3: Body Fluids and Circulation (8-10 Marks)

### Weightage Analysis:
- 2024 NEET: 10 marks (3 questions)
- 2023 NEET: 8 marks (2 questions)
- Trend: Increasing (12 marks some years)

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. Blood Composition and RBC Structure
**What NEET Asks:**
- RBC structure (biconcave shape; why?)
- Hemoglobin content and O₂ carrying capacity
- Life span of RBC (120 days)

**Critical: Why Biconcave Shape?**
- Increases surface area-to-volume ratio
- Permits maximum O₂ absorption from lungs
- Allows passage through narrow capillaries
- Removed from circulation after 120 days → spleen destroys → hemoglobin recycled

#### 2. Heart: Chambers, Valves, Conduction
**This is NEET's favorite Physiology topic.**

**Chamber Function:**
- Right Atrium: Receives deoxygenated blood from vena cava
- Right Ventricle: Pumps to lungs via pulmonary artery
- Left Atrium: Receives oxygenated blood from pulmonary vein
- Left Ventricle: Pumps to body via aorta

**Valves and Flow:**
- Tricuspid valve (right side; 3 cusps)
- Mitral/Bicuspid valve (left side; 2 cusps)
- Aortic valve (semilunar; prevents backflow)
- Pulmonary valve (semilunar; prevents backflow)

**Mnemonic:** "Try to BiCep" (Tri=3 cusps, Bi=2 cusps)

**Cardiac Cycle (Most Important for NEET):**

**Systole (0.4 seconds — ventricles contract):**
- Ventricular pressure ↑
- AV valves close (tricuspid, mitral)
- Semilunar valves open (aortic, pulmonary)
- Blood ejected to lungs and body

**Diastole (0.6 seconds — ventricles relax):**
- Ventricular pressure ↓
- Semilunar valves close
- AV valves open
- Blood fills ventricles from atria

**Total cardiac cycle:** 0.4 + 0.6 = 1 second (Heart rate 60 bpm = 60 cycles/min)

**Heart Sounds:**
- Lubb (first sound): AV valves close (systole begins)
- Dupp (second sound): Semilunar valves close (diastole begins)

**Question Type:** "A patient has a murmur at systole. Which valve is likely faulty?"
Answer: Aortic or pulmonary valve (semilunar; if leaky, blood flows backward during systole).

#### 3. Blood Pressure Regulation
**What NEET Asks:**
- Systolic vs diastolic pressure
- Factors affecting BP
- Renin-angiotensin system

**Normal BP:** 120/80 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)

**Factors Increasing BP:**
- Sympathetic stimulation (epinephrine, norepinephrine)
- Renin-angiotensin system (aldosterone increases salt retention → water retention → BP ↑)
- Increased blood volume
- Increased vessel resistance

**Question Type:** "High blood pressure patient. Which hormone's blocker might help?"
Answer: ACE inhibitor (blocks angiotensin II formation) OR Aldosterone antagonist (reduces Na+ retention).

#### 4. Blood Groups and Transfusion
**NEET Level:**
- ABO system (A, B, AB, O)
- Rh factor (positive/negative)
- Compatibility rules

**Blood Type Genetics:**
- Type A: Genotype AA or AO
- Type B: Genotype BB or BO
- Type AB: Genotype AB
- Type O: Genotype OO

**Transfusion Rules:**
- O⁻ is universal donor (no antigens)
- AB+ is universal recipient (no antibodies)
- Type A can donate to A and AB
- Type B can donate to B and AB

**Question Type:** "Child born to Type A mother and Type B father. Child is Type O. Why no transfusion issues?"
Answer: Child has no A or B antigens (Type O); mother and father have anti-B and anti-A antibodies respectively, which are IgG (don't cross placenta in first pregnancy).

### Circulation Chapter Strategy:

**Days 1-2:** Blood composition, RBC, WBC functions
**Days 3-4:** Heart anatomy and chambers (draw diagrams multiple times)
**Days 5-6:** Cardiac cycle (systole-diastole), valves, sounds
**Days 7-8:** Blood groups, transfusion, Rh factor
**Days 9-10:** Blood pressure, hormonal regulation

**Clinical Context Tip:** Visit hospital cardiology OPD to see actual ECG; understand how electrical activity relates to systole-diastole.

**Expected Accuracy:** 80-85%

## Chapter 4: Excretion and Osmoregulation (8-10 Marks)

### Weightage Analysis:
- 2024 NEET: 10 marks (3 questions)
- 2023 NEET: 8 marks (2 questions)
- Trend: Increasingly mechanism-heavy
- **Difficulty: HIGH** (students score lowest here)

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. Kidney Structure: Nephron Architecture
**Why This Matters:** 30% of Excretion questions test nephron understanding.

**Nephron Zones and Their Functions:**

| Zone | Structure | Function | Key Mechanism |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Bowman's Capsule** | Cup-shaped | Filters blood | Glomerular filtration |
| **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT)** | Coiled tubule | Reabsorb useful substances | Active transport |
| **Loop of Henle** | U-shaped | Create osmotic gradient | Countercurrent multiplier |
| **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)** | Coiled tubule | Fine-tune reabsorption | Active transport (selective) |
| **Collecting Duct** | Straight tube | Final water reabsorption | ADH-regulated |

**Visual Understanding (Critical for Scoring):**
- Cortex: Bowman's capsule, PCT, early DCT
- Medulla: Loop of Henle, lower DCT, collecting duct

**Common Question Type:** "Which kidney region would be most affected if the counter-current multiplier fails?"
Answer: Medulla (Loop of Henle loses ability to concentrate urine).

#### 2. Glomerular Filtration (GFR)
**What NEET Tests:**
- Selective vs non-selective filtration
- Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR = 180 L/day in humans!)
- Substances filtered (small, non-protein-bound)
- Substances NOT filtered (large proteins, RBCs, WBCs)

**Mechanism:** Blood pressure in glomerulus forces small molecules through basement membrane:
- Glucose ✓ (filtered; reabsorbed in PCT)
- Urea ✓ (filtered; partially reabsorbed)
- Creatinine ✓ (filtered; not reabsorbed; used to calculate GFR)
- Proteins ✗ (too large; stays in blood)
- RBCs ✗ (too large)
- Hemoglobin ✗ (too large)

**Clinical Application Question:** "Patient urine shows glucose and RBCs. What's wrong?"
Answer:
- Glucose: Either diabetes (blood glucose too high; exceeds reabsorption capacity) OR kidney damage (proteins also present)
- RBCs: Glomerular damage (allows large molecules through)

#### 3. Tubular Reabsorption: The Heart of Kidney Function
**This is where students get confused. Pay close attention.**

**Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) — Site of Maximum Reabsorption:**

| Substance | Reabsorption Mechanism | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Glucose** | Active transport (100% reabsorbed) | Carrier protein in epithelial cell; needs ATP |
| **Amino acids** | Active transport (100%) | Same carrier system as glucose |
| **Na⁺** | Active transport (70%) | Na-K pump |
| **Water** | Osmosis (70%) | Follows Na⁺ reabsorption |
| **Urea** | Partial diffusion (50%) | Passive; concentration-dependent |
| **Creatinine** | Minimal (5%) | Hardly reabsorbed; stays in filtrate |

**Why Active Transport in PCT?**
- Need to reclaim glucose (energy source) and amino acids (protein building blocks)
- PCT cells are packed with mitochondria (ATP production site)
- These are "valuable" molecules; kidney conserves them

**Loop of Henle: The Osmotic Gradient Machine (Countercurrent Multiplier)**

**Descending Limb (Permeable to Water):**
- Water leaves tubule
- Urine becomes concentrated (hypertonic)
- Osmolarity increases toward medulla

**Ascending Limb (Impermeable to Water):**
- Active Na⁺/Cl⁻ reabsorption
- Water doesn't follow (impermeability)
- Creates osmotic gradient
- This gradient allows water reabsorption later (collecting duct)

**Result:** Maximum urine concentration = 1200 mOsm/kg possible (due to Loop of Henle gradient)

**Question Type:** "Patient on loop diuretic (inhibits ascending limb). What happens?"
Answer: Can't establish osmotic gradient → can't concentrate urine → polyuria (excessive urination) → dehydration risk.

**Distal Convoluted Tubule & Collecting Duct: Fine Regulation**

- DCT: Selective reabsorption of Na⁺ (aldosterone-regulated) and Ca²⁺
- Collecting Duct: Water reabsorption (ADH-regulated)

**ADH (Vasopressin) Mechanism:**
- High blood osmolarity (low water) → ADH released
- ADH increases aquaporin channels in collecting duct
- More water reabsorbed
- Urine becomes concentrated

**Aldosterone Mechanism:**
- Low blood Na⁺ or high K⁺ → aldosterone released
- Aldosterone increases Na⁺ reabsorption in DCT & collecting duct
- Increases K⁺ secretion (reciprocal)
- Water follows Na⁺ osmotically

#### 4. Urine Formation and Composition
**What's in Normal Urine?**
- Urea (20-35 g/day)
- Creatinine (1-2 g/day)
- Uric acid (0.5 g/day)
- Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻ (variable, depends on diet)
- Water (1-2 L/day)

**What Should NOT Be in Normal Urine:**
- Glucose (if present → blood glucose >180 mg/dL)
- Proteins (if present → glomerular damage)
- RBCs (if present → kidney damage)
- Casts (if present → acute kidney injury)

**Abnormal Urines and What They Indicate:**

| Finding | Indicates |
|---------|-----------|
| Glucose | Diabetes mellitus (blood glucose too high) |
| Proteins | Glomerular disease (proteinuria) |
| RBCs | Glomerulonephritis or kidney stone |
| WBCs | Urinary tract infection |
| Ketones | Starvation, uncontrolled diabetes |
| Dark/Brown | Myoglobin (muscle breakdown) or old blood |

#### 5. Regulation of Water and Electrolytes
**Homeostasis Maintenance:**

**Water Balance:**
- Input: Drinking + food + metabolism = ~2.5 L/day
- Output: Urine (1-1.5 L) + perspiration + breathing = ~2.5 L/day
- Net: Zero; balanced

**ADH Regulation:**
- Low water (high osmolarity) → ADH ↑ → urine concentrated
- High water (low osmolarity) → ADH ↓ → urine dilute

**Osmolarity:** Normal = 300 mOsm/kg; range 275-295 in blood

**Electrolyte Balance:**
- Na⁺/K⁺ balanced by Na-K ATPase pump
- Ca²⁺ regulated by PTH (parathyroid hormone)
- H⁺ buffered by HCO₃⁻ system (kidney adjusts HCO₃⁻ excretion)

### Excretion Chapter Strategy:

**Days 1-2:** Nephron structure (draw and label 10 times)
**Days 3-4:** Glomerular filtration (what filters, why, how much)
**Days 5-7:** Tubular reabsorption (each segment's role, mechanisms, clinical significance)
**Days 8-9:** ADH and aldosterone regulation (mechanism and effects)
**Days 10:** Abnormal urine analysis (clinical cases)

**Critical Practice:** Solve mechanism-based questions. Example: "If Loop of Henle is blocked, what happens to collecting duct water reabsorption?" (Answer: Minimal; can't establish gradient)

**Expected Accuracy:** 70-80% (hardest chapter; needs deep understanding)

## Chapter 5: Nervous System (Neural Coordination) — 10-12 Marks

### Weightage & Importance:
- 2024 NEET: 12 marks (4 questions)
- 2023 NEET: 10 marks (3 questions)
- **Trend: HIGHEST weightage in Physiology**
- **Difficulty: HIGHEST**

### Key Topics:

#### 1. Neuron Structure and Nerve Impulse
**Resting Membrane Potential: -70 mV**
- Inside negative relative to outside
- Maintained by Na-K pump (3 Na out, 2 K in)
- Also by selective membrane permeability

**Action Potential Phases:**

**Phase 1: Resting (-70 mV)**
- Membrane hyperpolarized
- K⁺ channels open; Na⁺ channels closed

**Phase 2: Depolarization (threshold -55 mV)**
- Stimulus opens Na⁺ channels
- Na⁺ rushes in
- Membrane potential becomes positive (+30 mV at peak)

**Phase 3: Repolarization**
- Na⁺ channels inactivate (close)
- K⁺ channels open (delayed)
- K⁺ exits cell
- Membrane returns to negative

**Phase 4: Hyperpolarization**
- K⁺ channels stay open too long
- Potential dips below resting (-90 mV)
- Refractory period (neuron can't fire)

**Critical NEET Question:** "During refractory period, why can't neuron fire even with strong stimulus?"
Answer: Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels are inactivated (different from closed). They can't open until repolarized. This ensures one-way signal propagation.

#### 2. Synapse and Neurotransmitters
**Synaptic Transmission:**

1. Action potential reaches axon terminal
2. Ca²⁺ channels open
3. Ca²⁺ influx triggers vesicle fusion
4. Neurotransmitters released into synaptic cleft
5. Bind to receptors on postsynaptic membrane
6. Postsynaptic potential change (EPSC or IPSC)

**Common Neurotransmitters:**

| NT | Function | Examples |
|---|----------|----------|
| Acetylcholine | Activating | Neuromuscular junction, parasympathetic |
| Dopamine | Activating | Brain motor control |
| Serotonin | Inhibitory | Mood regulation; sleep |
| GABA | Inhibitory | CNS; prevents over-excitation |
| Glutamate | Activating | Learning, memory formation |

**Critical Concept:** Synapse is unidirectional because neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic terminal, not postsynaptic.

**Question Type:** "Drug blocks glutamate receptors. What's affected?"
Answer: Learning and memory formation (hippocampus uses glutamate).

#### 3. Reflex Arc
**Simplest Nervous System Response — No Brain Involved!**

**Components (in order):**
1. Sensory receptor (detects stimulus)
2. Sensory neuron (carries signal to spinal cord)
3. Spinal cord (integration)
4. Motor neuron (carries signal to muscle)
5. Effector (muscle contracts)

**Classic Example:** Touch hot stove → withdrawal reflex (your hand moves before you even feel pain)

**Why This Matters:** Reflex arc demonstrates that spinal cord alone can produce response (doesn't need brain). This is tested for understanding nervous system organization.

**Question Type:** "Spinal cord severed at waist. Can person still withdraw foot from painful stimulus?"
Answer: YES (spinal reflex arc still functional below cut).

#### 4. Brain Structure and Function
**Cerebrum (Largest Part):**
- Divided into 4 lobes (Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital)
- Frontal lobe: Motor control, decision-making, personality
- Parietal lobe: Sensory reception
- Temporal lobe: Hearing, memory, emotion
- Occipital lobe: Vision

**Cerebellum:**
- Coordination, balance, motor learning
- Damage → lack of coordination (ataxia), tremor

**Brainstem (Medulla, Pons, Midbrain):**
- Vital centers: Respiration, heart rate, blood pressure
- Damage to medulla → death

**Thalamus:**
- Relay center (all sensory info passes through except smell)
- Processes and directs to appropriate cortex area

**Hypothalamus:**
- Temperature regulation
- Hunger/satiety control
- Hormone control (pituitary connection)
- Circadian rhythm

**Question Type:** "Damage to occipital lobe. What's affected?"
Answer: Vision (visual cortex located here).

#### 5. Autonomic Nervous System
**Sympathetic (Fight-or-Flight):**
- Increases heart rate, blood pressure, breathing
- Dilates pupils
- Inhibits digestion
- Neurotransmitter: Norepinephrine
- Effect: Adrenergic

**Parasympathetic (Rest-and-Digest):**
- Decreases heart rate, blood pressure
- Constricts pupils
- Enhances digestion
- Neurotransmitter: Acetylcholine
- Effect: Cholinergic

**Question Type:** "Patient given beta-blocker (blocks norepinephrine). What happens?"
Answer: Heart rate decreases, blood pressure decreases (blocks sympathetic effect).

### Neural Coordination Strategy:

**Days 1-2:** Neuron structure, resting membrane potential
**Days 3-4:** Action potential generation and conduction
**Days 5-6:** Synapse and neurotransmitters
**Days 7-8:** Reflex arc, spinal nerve organization
**Days 9-10:** Brain structure and function
**Days 11-12:** Autonomic nervous system, sympathetic vs parasympathetic

**Hospital Visit Tip:** If possible, see actual EEG (Electroencephalogram) recording to understand brain electrical activity.

**Expected Accuracy:** 70-75% (most students score 60-70 here)

## Chapter 6: Chemical Coordination (Endocrine System) — 8-10 Marks

### Key Hormones and Functions:

**Pituitary Gland Hormones:**

| Hormone | Target | Effect | Regulation |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Growth Hormone (GH) | All tissues | Growth, protein synthesis | Hypothalamus (GRH, GIH) |
| Prolactin | Breasts | Milk production | Hypothalamus (PIH) |
| TSH | Thyroid | Thyroid hormone production | Hypothalamus (TRH); Neg feedback |
| ACTH | Adrenal | Cortisol production | Hypothalamus (CRH); Neg feedback |
| LH, FSH | Gonads | Sex hormone, gamete production | Hypothalamus (GnRH) |
| ADH | Kidney | Water reabsorption | Osmolarity; volume |
| Oxytocin | Uterus, breasts | Contraction, milk ejection | Suckling stimulus |

**Thyroid Hormones:**
- T3, T4: Increase metabolic rate
- Calcitonin: Lowers blood calcium

**Pancreatic Hormones:**
- Insulin: Lowers blood glucose (promotes uptake)
- Glucagon: Raises blood glucose (promotes breakdown)

**Adrenal Hormones:**
- Epinephrine/Norepinephrine: Sympathetic response (fight-or-flight)
- Cortisol: Stress response, glucose metabolism
- Aldosterone: Na⁺ reabsorption, blood pressure

**Thyroid, Adrenal, Reproductive Hormones:**
- Extensive negative feedback regulation
- Prevents over/under-secretion

### Chemical Coordination Strategy:

**Days 1-3:** Pituitary hormones and functions
**Days 4-5:** Thyroid and parathyroid
**Days 6-7:** Pancreatic hormones and diabetes
**Days 8-9:** Adrenal hormones and stress
**Days 10:** Reproductive hormones and menstrual cycle

**Expected Accuracy:** 80-85%

## Section 7: Complete NEET-Style Questions

**Q1 (Digestion):** "A person shows inability to digest fats despite normal liver function. Which enzyme deficiency is most likely?"
A) Amylase  B) Peptidase  C) Lipase  D) Nuclease

**Answer: C) Lipase** (Pancreatic lipase is essential for fat digestion; liver produces bile which emulsifies but doesn't digest fats)

**Q2 (Respiration):** "Chemoreceptors are stimulated primarily by:"
A) Decreased O₂  B) Increased CO₂  C) Increased pH  D) Decreased temperature

**Answer: B) Increased CO₂** (Even 2% increase in CO₂ significantly stimulates breathing; O₂ must drop to <60 mmHg for effect)

---

**Q3 (Circulation):** "First sound of heart (Lubb) occurs when:"
A) AV valves open  B) AV valves close  C) Semilunar valves open  D) Semilunar valves close

**Answer: B) AV valves close** (Marks beginning of systole)

---

**Q4 (Excretion):** "Glycosuria (glucose in urine) occurs when blood glucose exceeds:"
A) 100 mg/dL  B) 125 mg/dL  C) 180 mg/dL  D) 250 mg/dL

**Answer: C) 180 mg/dL** (Renal threshold — above this, glucose can't be completely reabsorbed)

---

**Q5 (Nervous System):** "During refractory period, a new action potential cannot be generated because:"
A) Threshold is very high  B) Na⁺ channels are inactivated  C) K⁺ channels are closed  D) Membrane is hyperpolarized

**Answer: B) Na⁺ channels are inactivated** (Inactivation is different from closure; they must pass through closed state before opening again)

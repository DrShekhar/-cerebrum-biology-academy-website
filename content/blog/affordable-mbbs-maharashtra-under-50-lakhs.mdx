## Financial Planning for Affordable MBBS

### Education Loan Options

| Bank   | Max Amount | Interest | EMI (for Rs 35L) |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| SBI    | 1.5 Cr     | 8.5%     | Rs 36,000        |
| BoB    | 1 Cr       | 8.9%     | Rs 37,500        |
| PNB    | 75L        | 9.2%     | Rs 38,500        |
| Canara | 50L        | 9.5%     | Rs 39,500        |

### Loan Repayment Timeline

**For Rs 35 Lakh Loan at 9% Interest:**

| Tenure   | EMI       | Total Interest | Total Paid |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 7 years  | Rs 54,000 | Rs 10.3L       | Rs 45.3L   |
| 10 years | Rs 44,000 | Rs 17.8L       | Rs 52.8L   |
| 15 years | Rs 35,500 | Rs 28.9L       | Rs 63.9L   |

> **Tip:** Try to repay faster. 7-year tenure saves Rs 18L+ compared to 15-year.

### Scholarship Opportunities

| Scholarship           | Eligibility       | Amount                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Post-Matric SC/ST     | Category          | Full fees (some states) |
| Maharashtra EBC       | Income below 8L   | Variable                |
| Merit Scholarship     | NEET top scorers  | College-specific        |
| Minority Scholarship  | Minority students | Up to 30-50%            |
| Bank Interest Subsidy | Below BPL         | Interest waiver         |

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Choose state quota** - Lower than management
2. **Day scholar option** - Save Rs 3-5L on hostel
3. **Used textbooks** - Save Rs 50K-1L
4. **Apply all scholarships** - Even partial helps
5. **Early loan application** - Better rates
6. **Negotiate** - Some colleges offer discounts

## Who Should Choose Affordable Colleges?

   - Cannot get premium colleges
   - Want MBBS without drop
   - Practical approach

3. **Goal: Clinical Practice**
   - Want to become practicing doctor

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Is the MBBS degree from affordable colleges valid?

**Absolutely yes.** If the college is NMC recognized, your MBBS degree is:

- Valid for practice anywhere in India
- Eligible for NEET PG
- Valid for government jobs
- Valid for foreign licensing (USMLE, PLAB)

### Q2: Can I become a specialist after affordable college MBBS?

**Yes.** NEET PG doesn't care which college you graduated from. Your rank determines admission. Many students from tier-2 colleges clear NEET PG and get MD/MS.

### Q3: Will hospitals hire me if I'm from an affordable college?

**Yes.** Hiring depends on:

- Your skills and knowledge
- Interview performance
- Experience
- NOT your MBBS college name

After 3-5 years, nobody asks which college you attended.

### Q4: What about clinical exposure in affordable colleges?

**Adequate for MBBS curriculum:**

- All NMC approved colleges meet minimum standards
- 400-600 beds are sufficient for UG training
- Focus on OPD and IPD postings
- May need external exposure for super-specialties

### Q5: How do affordable colleges fare in NEET PG?

**Variable.** Results depend on:

- Student's individual preparation
- Coaching (most join external)
- Self-study dedication

Top students from any college clear NEET PG. The college name doesn't determine your PG success.

### Q6: Is management quota worth it in affordable colleges?

**Maybe.** If management quota is Rs 14L vs Rs 8L state quota:

- 5-year extra cost: Rs 30L more
- Total: Rs 70L instead of Rs 40L

Better to wait for later DMER rounds than overpay for management quota in affordable colleges.

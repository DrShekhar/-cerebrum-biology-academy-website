# Cell Structure and Function - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Cell Biology contributes approximately **8-10 questions** in NEET, making it one of the most important chapters from Class 11. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know for NEET 2026.

## Introduction to Cells

The cell is the **structural and functional unit of all living organisms**. This concept was established through centuries of scientific discovery.

### Discovery of Cell

| Scientist             | Year | Contribution                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Robert Hooke          | 1665 | First observed cells in cork; coined term "cell"                    |
| Anton van Leeuwenhoek | 1674 | First to observe living cells (bacteria, protozoa)                  |
| Robert Brown          | 1831 | Discovered nucleus                                                  |
| Schleiden             | 1838 | All plants are made of cells                                        |
| Schwann               | 1839 | All animals are made of cells                                       |
| Rudolf Virchow        | 1855 | "Omnis cellula-e cellula" (all cells arise from pre-existing cells) |

### Cell Theory

The **Cell Theory** states:

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells
2. Cell is the basic unit of life
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells

**Exception to Cell Theory:** Viruses are acellular (not made of cells) but show characteristics of life when inside a host.

## Types of Cells

### Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells

| Feature                   | Prokaryotic Cell        | Eukaryotic Cell            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Size                      | 1-10 μm                 | 10-100 μm                  |
| Nucleus                   | Nucleoid (no membrane)  | True nucleus with membrane |
| Membrane-bound organelles | Absent                  | Present                    |
| DNA                       | Circular, naked         | Linear, with histones      |
| Ribosomes                 | 70S (50S + 30S)         | 80S (60S + 40S)            |
| Cell division             | Binary fission          | Mitosis/Meiosis            |
| Examples                  | Bacteria, Cyanobacteria | Plants, Animals, Fungi     |

**NEET Tip:** Remember that ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts are 70S type, similar to prokaryotes - supporting endosymbiotic theory.

## FAQs

**Q: Why are mitochondria called the powerhouse of the cell?**
A: Mitochondria produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through oxidative phosphorylation, which is the energy currency of the cell. Most cellular ATP is generated in mitochondria.

**Q: What is the difference between rough and smooth ER?**
A: Rough ER has ribosomes attached and is involved in protein synthesis. Smooth ER lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification.

**Q: Why is lysosome called the suicidal bag?**
A: Lysosomes contain powerful hydrolytic enzymes. If their membrane ruptures, these enzymes can digest the entire cell (autolysis), hence called suicidal bags.

**Q: What is the endosymbiotic theory?**
A: This theory suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells, eventually becoming organelles. Evidence includes their own DNA, 70S ribosomes, and double membrane.

**Q: Why do plant cells have cell walls but animal cells don't?**
A: Plant cells need rigid cell walls for structural support (since they don't have skeletons) and to maintain shape against turgor pressure. Animal cells have other support mechanisms (cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many years of PYQs should I solve for NEET?

Minimum 10 years (2015-2024) is essential. For thorough preparation, solve 15-20 years. Questions older than 20 years may have outdated syllabus content.

### Are PYQs enough for NEET Biology?

PYQs should be solved after completing NCERT. They help in understanding patterns but NCERT remains primary. Combine with mock tests for best results.

### Which chapters have maximum PYQ repetition?

Genetics, Human Physiology, and Plant Reproduction have the highest repetition rate. Focus on mastering these for guaranteed marks.

### Should I solve PYQs topic-wise or year-wise?

Start with topic-wise to build concept clarity. Move to year-wise papers in last 2-3 months to practice time management.

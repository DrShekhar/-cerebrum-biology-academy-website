# Best Books for NEET 2026: The Complete Guide

Choosing the right books is one of the most critical decisions in your NEET preparation. With hundreds of books available in the market, students often get confused and end up buying too many, which leads to incomplete preparation. This guide will help you choose the perfect books for NEET 2026.

## The Golden Rule: NCERT First, Everything Else Later

Before we discuss reference books, let's establish the most important fact:

> **NCERT is not optional. It's mandatory.**

Here's why:

- 95% of NEET questions come directly or indirectly from NCERT
- NTA designs questions keeping NCERT as the primary source
- Most toppers attribute their success to thorough NCERT reading
- NCERT language and terminology are used in questions

**The NCERT Books You Need:**

| Class | Subject   | Book Name                           |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |

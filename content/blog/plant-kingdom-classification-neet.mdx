# Plant Kingdom - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Plant Kingdom is a high-weightage chapter from Diversity of Living Organisms, contributing **4-6 questions** in NEET annually. This guide covers all major plant groups with their characteristics.

## Classification of Plant Kingdom

### Basis of Classification

1. **Plant body:** Thallus vs differentiated
2. **Vascular tissue:** Absent vs present
3. **Seed formation:** Seedless vs seed-bearing
4. **Seed type:** Naked vs enclosed in fruit

### Major Groups

| Group | Vascular Tissue | Seeds | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Algae | Absent | Absent | Spirogyra, Ulva |
| Bryophytes | Absent | Absent | Mosses, Liverworts |
| Pteridophytes | Present | Absent | Ferns, Selaginella |
| Gymnosperms | Present | Naked | Pinus, Cycas |
| Angiosperms | Present | Enclosed | All flowering plants |

- Require water for fertilization
- Have rhizoids (not true roots)

### Why "Amphibians of Plant Kingdom"?

1. Live on land but need water for sexual reproduction
2. Sperm are flagellated, swim to egg
3. Transition group between aquatic and terrestrial life

### Classification

#### 1. Liverworts (Hepaticopsida)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Body | Thalloid or leafy |
| Dorsiventral | Yes |

**Life Cycle of Moss:**
1. Spore (n) → Protonema → Leafy gametophyte
2. Archegonia (♀) + Antheridia (♂) on gametophyte
3. Fertilization → Zygote (2n)
4. Zygote → Sporophyte (foot, seta, capsule)
5. Spore mother cells → Meiosis → Spores

## FAQs

**Q: Why are bryophytes called amphibians of the plant kingdom?**
A: Bryophytes live on land but require water for sexual reproduction. Their sperm are flagellated and must swim through water to reach the egg, just like amphibians depend on water for reproduction.

**Q: What is the significance of heterospory?**
A: Heterospory is an evolutionary advancement toward seed formation. Megaspores are retained on the parent plant and develop into female gametophyte, eventually leading to seed habit in gymnosperms and angiosperms.

**Q: Why don't gymnosperms and angiosperms need water for fertilization?**
A: They have pollen tubes. Pollen grains land near ovules, germinate, and the pollen tube delivers sperm directly to the egg, eliminating the need for water.

**Q: What makes angiosperms the most successful plant group?**
A: Angiosperms have several advantages: (1) enclosed seeds protected by fruits, (2) double fertilization providing endosperm for embryo nutrition, (3) flowers attracting pollinators for efficient reproduction, (4) diverse adaptations to various habitats.

**Q: Why are red algae found at greater depths than other algae?**
A: Red algae contain phycoerythrin, which absorbs blue and green light that penetrates deeper into water. This allows them to photosynthesize at depths where other algae cannot survive.

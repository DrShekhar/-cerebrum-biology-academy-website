## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Getting Started

**Q: When should my child start preparing for USABO?**
A: The earlier, the better. Starting in 9th grade gives your child 4 attempts. Most successful finalists started in 9th or 10th grade.

**Q: Does my child need to take AP Biology first?**
A: No! AP Biology is NOT required. USABO preparation using Campbell Biology actually goes beyond AP Biology content.

**Q: What if our school doesn't participate in USABO?**
A: Contact USABO to find a host school in your area. Many schools accept students from non-participating schools.

### Eligibility Questions

**Q: My child is on an F1 student visa. Can they participate?**
A: Unfortunately, no. USABO requires US citizenship or Green Card (permanent residency). F1 visa students should consider competing in their home country's Biology Olympiad.

**Q: Can home-schooled students participate?**
A: Yes! Contact USABO before registration deadline to arrange participation through a local school.

**Q: Can students participate multiple years?**
A: Yes, students can participate every year of high school (up to 4 times).

### Preparation Questions

**Q: How many hours per week should my child study?**
A:
- Casual preparation: 4-6 hours/week
- Serious (Semifinal target): 8-12 hours/week
- Intensive (Finals target): 15-20+ hours/week

**Q: Is Campbell Biology enough for the Open Exam?**
A: Yes! For the Open Exam, thorough mastery of Campbell Biology is sufficient. Supplementary texts become important for Semifinals and beyond.

**Q: Should my child do research while preparing?**
A: Research experience is valuable but not required. Focus on competition preparation first. Research becomes more important in 11th-12th grade.

### College Applications

**Q: How do I include USABO on college applications?**
A: List it under academic competitions/awards. Include specific achievement level (Semifinalist, Finalist, etc.) and year.

**Q: Will USABO help if my child doesn't make Finals?**
A: Yes! Even being a Semifinalist (top 10% of 10,000+ students) is a significant achievement that strengthens applications.

# How to Score 320+ in NEET Biology

Scoring 320+ out of 360 in NEET Biology is achievable with the right strategy. Biology alone can secure your medical seat if you master it. Here is the complete roadmap.

---

## Why 320+ in Biology?

### The Math Behind Medical Selection

| Score Scenario | Biology | Physics + Chemistry | Total | Rank Range |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Biology Focus | 320+ | 300 | 620+ | Under 15,000 |
| Balanced | 280 | 340 | 620 | Under 15,000 |
| Biology Weak | 250 | 350 | 600 | 30,000-40,000 |

**Key Insight**: Students who score 320+ in Biology have significantly better rank outcomes because:
- Biology has 90 questions (50% of paper)
- Biology questions are more predictable (NCERT-based)
- Less calculation errors compared to Physics
- Higher accuracy possible with proper preparation

### Toppers' Biology Scores

| NEET Year | Top Scorer Biology | Average Top 100 Biology |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 2024 | 360/360 | 340+ |
| 2023 | 356/360 | 338+ |
| 2022 | 360/360 | 342+ |

## NCERT Mastery Techniques

### The 5-Reading Method

| Reading | Purpose | Technique |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 1st Reading | Overview | Read like a story, no notes |
| 2nd Reading | Understanding | Make short notes, highlight |
| 3rd Reading | Details | Focus on diagrams, tables |
| 4th Reading | Exceptions | Note special cases, examples |
| 5th Reading | Exam Mode | Read only highlighted parts |

### What to Highlight in NCERT

| Category | Examples | Why Important |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Numbers/Values | pH 7.35-7.45, BP 120/80 | Direct questions |
| Names | Scientist names, disease names | Factual MCQs |
| Exceptions | Only, except, unique | Tricky questions |
| Processes | Steps in glycolysis, Krebs cycle | Sequential questions |
| Comparisons | Mitosis vs Meiosis | Table-based questions |

### NCERT Lines That Become Questions

**Example from Human Physiology:**

NCERT Line: "The normal activities of the heart are regulated intrinsically, i.e., auto regulated by specialised muscles (nodal tissue)"

Question Pattern: "The


 heart is autoregulated by:"
- A) Nervous tissue
- B) Nodal tissue ✓
- C) Cardiac muscle
- D) Purkinje fibres

**Technique**: Read NCERT as if every line is a potential question.

| Excretion | Nephron + Counter-current | Concentration gradient |
| Neural | Brain regions + Synaptic transmission | Mixed-up functions |
| Chemical Coordination | Hormones + Disorders | Similar-sounding hormones |

**Must-Know Tables:**
- Digestive enzymes with substrates and products
- Respiratory volumes and capacities
- Hormones with source and function
- Brain parts with functions

**Must-Know Diagrams:**
- Human digestive system
- Heart cross-section with blood flow
- Nephron structure
- Neuron and synapse
- Endocrine glands location

### Genetics (Target: 35/40)

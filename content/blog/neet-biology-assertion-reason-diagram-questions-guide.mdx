# NEET Biology Assertion-Reason & Diagram Questions

Two question types consistently trouble NEET aspirants: **assertion-reason (A-R)** and **diagram-based questions**. Together, they contribute 20-30 marks in Biology alone. Mastering them can be the difference between 300 and 340 in Biology.

## Part 1: Assertion-Reason Questions

### What Are Assertion-Reason Questions?

In these questions, two statements are given:

- **Assertion (A):** A factual statement
- **Reason (R):** An explanation or related statement

You must evaluate both statements AND their relationship.

### The 4 Answer Options

| Option  | Meaning                                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **(a)** | Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A     |
| **(b)** | Both A and R are true, but R is NOT the correct explanation of A |
| **(c)** | A is true, but R is false                                        |
| **(d)** | A is false, but R is true                                        |

**Note:** Some NEET papers include a 5th option where both are false. Always read the options carefully.

### The 4-Step Solving Strategy

**Step 1: Evaluate Assertion (A) independently**

- Is this statement factually correct?
- Can you recall this from NCERT?
- If A is false → answer is (d) (if R is true) or both false

**Step 2: Evaluate Reason (R) independently**

- Is this statement factually correct on its own?
- Do not think about its relationship to A yet
- If R is false → answer is (c) (assuming A is true)

**Step 3: Check if both are true**

- If both are true, proceed to Step 4
- If only one is true, you already have your answer

**Step 4: Check the relationship**

- Does R actually explain WHY A is true?
- Is there a cause-effect relationship?
- If yes → (a). If no → (b)

### Practice Questions: Genetics

**Q1.**
**Assertion (A):** In Mendel's monohybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 3:1.
**Reason (R):** During gamete formation, alleles segregate so that each gamete receives only one allele.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both statements are true. The 3:1 ratio (A) occurs precisely because of the law of segregation (R). R directly explains why A happens — alleles separate during gamete formation, and random combination in F2 produces the 3:1 ratio.

---

**Q2.**
**Assertion (A):** Haemophilia is more common in males than females.
**Reason (R):** Haemophilia is an autosomal recessive disorder.

**Answer:** (c)
**Explanation:** A is true — haemophilia is indeed more common in males. But R is false — haemophilia is X-linked recessive, not autosomal recessive. Males need only one copy of the defective allele (XʰY) while females need two (XʰXʰ), making it rarer in females.

---

**Q3.**
**Assertion (A):** Turner's syndrome individuals are sterile females with 45 chromosomes.
**Reason (R):** Turner's syndrome is caused by monosomy of the X chromosome (44+XO).

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R correctly explains A. The monosomy of X chromosome (45,XO karyotype) directly causes the female phenotype with sterility — the missing X chromosome leads to underdeveloped ovaries and infertility.

---

**Q4.**
**Assertion (A):** A cross between a homozygous red-flowered plant and a white-flowered plant in snapdragon produces pink flowers.
**Reason (R):** This is an example of codominance.

**Answer:** (c)
**Explanation:** A is true — snapdragon shows pink flowers in F1. But R is false — this is incomplete dominance, not codominance. In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote shows a blended phenotype (pink). In codominance, both alleles express simultaneously (like ABO blood groups where AB shows both A and B antigens).

---

**Q5.**
**Assertion (A):** DNA replication is semi-conservative.
**Reason (R):** Meselson and Stahl proved this using heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) labeling in E. coli.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true. Semi-conservative replication (A) was experimentally proven by the Meselson-Stahl experiment (R) using density gradient centrifugation of ¹⁵N-labeled DNA. The experiment directly demonstrated that each new DNA molecule contains one old and one new strand.

---

### Practice Questions: Human Physiology

**Q6.**
**Assertion (A):** Tidal volume is approximately 500 mL.
**Reason (R):** Tidal volume is the amount of air inspired or expired during normal breathing.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both statements are true, and R explains A. During normal quiet breathing (defined by R), approximately 500 mL of air moves in and out per breath (A). The definition of tidal volume directly determines its measured value.

---

**Q7.**
**Assertion (A):** Bile juice contains no digestive enzymes.
**Reason (R):** Bile is produced by the gallbladder.

**Answer:** (c)
**Explanation:** A is true — bile contains bile salts and bile pigments but no digestive enzymes. It emulsifies fats but does not enzymatically digest them. R is false — bile is produced by the liver (hepatocytes), not the gallbladder. The gallbladder only stores and concentrates bile.

---

**Q8.**
**Assertion (A):** The SA node is called the pacemaker of the heart.
**Reason (R):** The SA node generates the maximum rate of action potentials in the heart.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R explains A. The SA node is called the pacemaker (A) because it has the highest intrinsic rate of action potential generation (~70-75 beats/min), which drives the rhythmic contraction of the entire heart. Other nodes (AV node, Bundle of His) have slower rates and follow the SA node's lead.

---

**Q9.**
**Assertion (A):** Urine is hypotonic when it reaches the collecting duct.
**Reason (R):** The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true and R explains A. The ascending limb actively transports NaCl out but does not allow water to follow (impermeable to water, R). This creates a dilute (hypotonic) filtrate that reaches the collecting duct (A). The collecting duct then concentrates urine based on ADH levels.

---

**Q10.**
**Assertion (A):** Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease affecting neuromuscular junctions.
**Reason (R):** Antibodies attack acetylcholine receptors, leading to muscle weakness.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R correctly explains A. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (R). This reduces signal transmission from nerve to muscle, causing progressive muscle weakness (A).

---

### Practice Questions: Ecology and Evolution

**Q11.**
**Assertion (A):** The pyramid of energy is always upright.
**Reason (R):** Energy transfer between trophic levels follows the 10% law.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R explains A. At each trophic level, only about 10% of energy is transferred to the next level (R). This means energy always decreases as you go up trophic levels, making the pyramid always upright (A). Unlike biomass or number pyramids, energy pyramids can never be inverted.

---

**Q12.**
**Assertion (A):** Darwin's finches are an example of adaptive radiation.
**Reason (R):** All finches evolved from a common ancestor and adapted to different ecological niches.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R explains A. Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands descended from a single ancestor species (R) and diversified into 14+ species with different beak shapes adapted to different food sources. This divergent evolution from a common ancestor into multiple forms is the definition of adaptive radiation (A).

---

**Q13.**
**Assertion (A):** Lichens are good indicators of air pollution.
**Reason (R):** Lichens can tolerate high levels of sulfur dioxide.

**Answer:** (c)
**Explanation:** A is true — lichens are indeed bioindicators of air quality. However, R is false — lichens are extremely sensitive to SO₂ and other pollutants. They disappear from areas with high air pollution. Their sensitivity (not tolerance) is what makes them useful indicators — their absence signals polluted air.

---

**Q14.**
**Assertion (A):** Primary succession on bare rock begins with lichen colonization.
**Reason (R):** Lichens secrete acids that help in weathering of rock to form soil.

**Answer:** (a)
**Explanation:** Both are true, and R explains A. Lichens are pioneer species on bare rock (A) because they can grow on hard surfaces and secrete organic acids that gradually break down rock into soil (R). This soil formation allows subsequent species (mosses, then grasses, then shrubs) to establish.

### Practice Questions: Cell Biology and Biomolecules

**Q15.**
**Assertion (A):** Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell.
**Reason (R):** Mitochondria contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes.

**Answer:** (b)
**Explanation:** Both statements are true, but R does not explain A. Mitochondria are called the powerhouse because they produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (the actual reason). The fact that they have their own DNA and ribosomes (R) relates to the endosymbiotic theory of their origin, not to their energy-producing function.

---

**Q16.**
**Assertion (A):** Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.
**Reason (R):** Enzymes are consumed during the reaction they catalyze.

**Answer:** (c)
**Explanation:** A is true — enzymes lower activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower energy barriers. R is false — enzymes are biological catalysts that remain unchanged after the reaction. They can be reused for multiple reaction cycles, which is why small amounts of enzyme can process large amounts of substrate.

---

**Q17.**
**Assertion (A):** The cell wall of fungi is made of chitin.
**Reason (R):** Chitin is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine.

**Answer:** (b)
**Explanation:** Both are true, but R does not explain A. The fungal cell wall is indeed made of chitin (A), and chitin is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine (R). However, the chemical composition of chitin does not explain why fungi use chitin for their cell wall rather than cellulose (used by plants) or peptidoglycan (used by bacteria).

### Common Traps in Assertion-Reason Questions

| Trap                                        | How to Avoid It                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Both statements seem related                | Ask: "Does R CAUSE or EXPLAIN A?" not just "Are they about the same topic?" |
| R is a true but unrelated fact              | A true statement is not automatically the explanation                       |
| A uses extreme language ("always", "never") | Check if there are exceptions — extreme words often signal false statements |
| R reverses cause and effect                 | Verify the direction: R should explain A, not the other way                 |
| Both statements are from different chapters | Cross-chapter A-R pairs usually have answer (b) — true but unrelated        |

### How to Study Diagrams Effectively

**The 3-Layer Approach:**

**Layer 1: Recognize**

- Can you identify the diagram without labels?
- Practice with blank diagrams — fill in labels from memory

**Layer 2: Label**

- Memorize every label shown in NCERT
- Pay attention to arrows (direction matters in cycles)
- Note specific numbers (e.g., 36-38 ATP in respiration)

**Layer 3: Explain**

- Can you explain what happens at each labeled point?
- Understand the process the diagram represents
- Connect the diagram to related concepts

### Practice: Diagram Identification Questions

**Q18.** A diagram shows a structure with an outer membrane, inner membrane with cristae, matrix containing circular DNA, and 70S ribosomes. Identify the organelle and its primary function.

**Answer:** Mitochondrion. Primary function is aerobic cellular respiration (oxidative phosphorylation) producing ATP. The cristae increase surface area for the electron transport chain. The matrix contains enzymes for the Krebs cycle.

---

**Q19.** In a diagram of a nephron, the structure between the Bowman's capsule and the loop of Henle is labeled X. Structure X and its primary function are:

**Answer:** Structure X is the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT). Its primary function is obligatory reabsorption of approximately 65-70% of water, all glucose, all amino acids, and most electrolytes from the glomerular filtrate. It has brush border microvilli to increase surface area for reabsorption.

---

**Q20.** A graph shows hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Peak A occurs around day 14, Peak B is sustained from day 15-28 and drops sharply if no fertilization occurs. Identify hormones A and B.

**Answer:** Peak A is LH (Luteinizing Hormone) — the LH surge triggers ovulation around day 14. Peak B is Progesterone — secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation, it maintains the endometrium for potential implantation. If no fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone drops, and menstruation begins.

---

**Q21.** A diagram shows the Z-scheme of light reactions. The component that splits water molecules is located at what position?

**Answer:** The water-splitting complex (OEC - Oxygen Evolving Complex) is associated with Photosystem II (PS II). It is located on the inner side (lumen side) of the thylakoid membrane. The reaction: 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂. The electrons replace those lost by P680 (reaction center of PS II) when it absorbs light.

### Diagram Question Strategies

| Strategy                | How to Apply                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Label everything first  | Before reading options, mentally label the diagram               |
| Follow the arrows       | Arrows show direction of flow (blood, filtrate, electrons)       |
| Count the structures    | Questions often ask "how many" — count carefully                 |
| Check for common errors | NTA sometimes has intentional errors in diagrams — identify them |
| Relate to process       | Connect the static diagram to the dynamic process it represents  |

### Quick Reference: Answer Distribution in Past Papers

| Answer Option                       | Frequency in Past A-R Questions |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| (a) Both true, R explains A         | ~35%                            |
| (b) Both true, R does NOT explain A | ~25%                            |
| (c) A true, R false                 | ~25%                            |
| (d) A false, R true                 | ~15%                            |

**Key Insight:** Option (a) is most common, but do not default to it. Always verify the explanation relationship.

## Key Takeaways for Exam Day

1. **Read assertion and reason SEPARATELY first** — evaluate each as an independent true/false statement
2. **Only check the relationship if BOTH are true** — saves time when one is false
3. **For diagrams, label mentally before reading options** — prevents options from confusing you
4. **NCERT diagrams are your primary source** — 95% of diagram questions come from NCERT figures
5. **Do not spend more than 90 seconds per A-R question** — if confused, mark and move on
6. **Practice 10 A-R questions daily for 30 days** — builds pattern recognition

# How to Score 360+ in NEET Biology: The Complete Guide

Scoring 360 out of 360 in NEET Biology might seem impossible, but with the right strategy, it's achievable. I've helped over 1,500 students score above 350 in Biology, and in this guide, I'll share the exact framework we use at Cerebrum Biology Academy.

## Why 360 in Biology is Crucial

| Subject | Maximum Marks | Realistic Target |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Physics | 180 | 140-150 |
| Chemistry | 180 | 150-160 |
| **Biology** | **360** | **340-360** |

Biology contributes **50% of total marks** and is the most scoring subject. While Physics and Chemistry can be tricky, Biology rewards consistent effort.

## Chapter-Wise Strategy for Maximum Marks

### High Weightage Chapters (60% of marks)

| Chapter | Expected Questions | Marks |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Human Physiology | 12-15 | 48-60 |
| Plant Physiology | 8-10 | 32-40 |
| Genetics & Evolution | 10-12 | 40-48 |
| Ecology & Environment | 8-10 | 32-40 |
| Biotechnology | 5-7 | 20-28 |

**Strategy:** Spend 60% of your study time on these chapters.

### Medium Weightage Chapters (30% of marks)

| Chapter | Expected Questions | Marks |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Cell Biology | 5-7 | 20-28 |
| Biomolecules | 4-5 | 16-20 |
| Reproduction | 5-6 | 20-24 |
| Diversity in Living World | 4-5 | 16-20 |

### Low Weightage Chapters (10% of marks)

Focus on these only after mastering high and medium weightage topics.

## The NCERT-First Approach

### Why NCERT is Non-Negotiable

- **95% of NEET questions** come from NCERT
- Exact lines are picked from NCERT text
- Even diagrams are taken from NCERT

### How to Read NCERT Effectively

1. **First Reading (Week 1-4)**
   - Read every chapter once
   - Highlight important points
   - Note down terms you don't understand

2. **Second Reading (Week 5-8)**
   - Focus on highlighted portions
   - Create mind maps for each chapter
   - Practice NCERT exemplar questions

3. **Third Reading (Week 9-12)**
   - Read only highlighted text
   - Focus on diagrams and tables
   - Time yourself while reading

## Daily Study Schedule for 360 Marks

### For Students in Class 12

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM | New topic study (NCERT) |
| 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM | Revision of previous day |
| 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM | MCQ practice (50 questions) |

### For Droppers/Repeaters

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM | New topic + notes making |
| 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM | Reference book concepts |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Ignoring NCERT for Reference Books

**Wrong approach:** Start with Trueman's or Pradeep's

**Right approach:** Complete NCERT first, then use reference books for additional concepts only.

### Mistake 2: Not Practicing MCQs

**Target MCQs:**
- Daily: 50-100 questions
- Weekly: 1 full-length test
- Monthly: 4 subject tests

### Mistake 3: Skipping Diagrams

Biology is a visual subject. Master these diagrams:

- Human digestive system with all parts
- Heart structure and blood flow
- Nephron structure
- DNA replication fork
- Krebs cycle
- Light reaction and Calvin cycle

### Mistake 4: Leaving Easy Chapters

Students often skip:
- Ecology (easiest 40 marks!)
- Reproduction in Organisms
- Environmental Issues

**These are gift marks. Don't leave them!**

---

## Topic-Wise Tips

### Human Physiology (Most Important)

- Learn all hormones with their source and function
- Understand feedback mechanisms
- Master cardiac cycle and ECG interpretation
- Practice numerical on breathing and blood

### Genetics & Evolution

- Practice Mendelian crosses until perfect
- Memorize all genetic disorders
- Understand Hardy-Weinberg principle
- Learn evolution theories with examples

### Ecology & Environment

- This is the most scoring unit
- Remember all food chain diagrams
- Learn succession with examples
- Memorize all environment-related values (BOD, DO, etc.)

---

## Last 3 Months Strategy

### Month 1: Complete Revision

- Finish all chapters once
- Make short notes for each chapter
- Complete NCERT exemplar

### Month 2: Practice Phase

- Solve previous 10 years' papers
- Daily 1 mock test
- Focus on weak areas

### Month 3: Test & Refine

- Only mock tests and revision
- Revise short notes daily
- Practice time management

## Reference Books (After NCERT)

| Purpose | Book |
|---------|------|
| Concept clarity | MTG Objective Biology |
| Advanced practice | Trueman's Biology Vol 1 & 2 |
| Quick revision | Biology at a Glance |
| Previous years | MTG NEET Champion |

## NEET Plant Physiology Weightage Overview

Plant Physiology is one of the most advanced and comprehensive units in NEET Biology, combining biochemistry, cellular processes, and ecological principles. This unit accounts for approximately **8-10 marks** annually and is considered Advanced difficulty due to the integration of multiple complex biochemical pathways and regulatory mechanisms.

The Plant Physiology unit spans three critical chapters: Photosynthesis, Respiration in Plants, and Plant Growth and Development. Together, these chapters test your understanding of energy conversion, metabolic pathways, hormonal regulation, and environmental responses—all essential knowledge for biochemistry and molecular biology understanding.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing light and dark reactions**: Dark reactions don't occur in darkness; they use products (ATP, NADPH) from light reactions. They occur during the day and night but depend on light reaction products.

2. **Incorrect Calvin cycle stoichiometry**: Remember that 3 CO2 entering the cycle produces 6 G3P, but only 1 G3P exits (net) to make glucose. 5 G3P molecules are used to regenerate 3 RuBP.

3. **Wrong C3 and C4 plant examples**: Common mistake mixing C3 and C4 plants. Remember: Wheat and rice are C3; maize and sugarcane are C4.

4. **ATP yield miscalculation**: Theoretical maximum is 32-38 ATP per glucose. Many students forget about the cost of transporting NADH across mitochondrial membrane (reducing yield by 1-2 ATP per NADH).

5. **Misunderstanding hormone mechanisms**: Hormones don't directly cause growth; they regulate genes that control growth. For example, auxin works through receptor proteins, not by direct enzyme inhibition.

6. **Confusing anabolic and catabolic pathways**: Photosynthesis is anabolic (building glucose); respiration is catabolic (breaking down glucose). Understand their opposing nature but interdependence.

7. **Ignoring photoperiodism details**: Students forget that short-day plants flower when day length is less than critical length (not more). This often leads to incorrect answers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why are light reactions called so if they produce ATP used in dark reactions?
**A:** Light reactions are reactions that require light as an energy source. The products (ATP and NADPH) from light reactions are used in dark reactions. Dark reactions don't occur in darkness either; they use the products from light reactions that were generated during the light period.

### Q2: What is the first stable compound produced in C3 plants?
**A:** The first stable compound is 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), a 3-carbon compound formed when RuBP (5-carbon) combines with CO2. This is why the pathway is called C3 photosynthesis.

### Q3: Why are C4 plants more efficient than C3 plants in hot, dry conditions?
**A:** C4 plants concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO enzyme in bundle sheath cells, reducing photorespiration losses. They also have better water use efficiency because they can fix CO2 at lower concentrations, allowing stomata to remain partially closed and conserve water.

### Q4: What happens to NADH produced in glycolysis during aerobic respiration?
**A:** NADH produced in glycolysis (cytoplasm) transfers electrons to the electron transport chain in mitochondria. Depending on the shuttle system used, these electrons generate 2-3 ATP molecules each during oxidative phosphorylation.

### Q5: How many ATP molecules are theoretically produced from one glucose molecule in aerobic respiration?
**A:** Theoretically, one glucose molecule can produce approximately 32-38 ATP molecules: 2 from glycolysis (substrate-level), 2 from Krebs cycle (substrate-level), and 28-34 from oxidative phosphorylation (approximately 3 ATP per NADH and 2 ATP per FADH2).

### Q6: What is the role of RuBisCO enzyme in photosynthesis?
**A:** RuBisCO (Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) catalyzes the first step of the Calvin cycle, combining RuBP (5-carbon) with CO2 to form 3-PG (3-carbon). It's considered the most abundant protein on Earth due to its crucial role in carbon fixation.

### Q7: How does auxin promote phototropism?
**A:** When exposed to unidirectional light, auxin is redistributed to the shaded side of the plant. Higher auxin concentration on the shaded side causes cells there to elongate more than cells on the illuminated side, causing the plant to bend toward light.

### Q8: What is the difference between long-day and short-day plants in photoperiodism?
**A:** Long-day plants flower when the day length exceeds a critical length (e.g., >12 hours light). Short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than a critical length (e.g., <12 hours light). Both respond to photoperiod through the phytochrome system.

### Q9: Why is abscisic acid important during drought stress?
**A:** Abscisic acid is produced in roots and transported to leaves during drought. It causes stomata to close by changing guard cell turgor pressure, reducing water loss through transpiration while also inhibiting photosynthesis to conserve resources during water scarcity.

### Q10: What is the significance of the respiratory quotient (RQ) value?
**A:** RQ = CO2 released / O2 consumed. RQ values indicate the substrate being respired: RQ = 1 for carbohydrates (CH2O), RQ = 0.7 for fats, RQ = 0.8-0.9 for proteins. This helps identify which nutrient is being catabolized for energy.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Plant Physiology accounts for 8-10 marks** in NEET with Advanced difficulty. Photosynthesis is the highest-weighted component (3-4 marks), requiring mastery of both light and dark reactions with detailed mechanism understanding.

2. **Light reactions and Calvin cycle** are the foundational concepts appearing in nearly every NEET exam. Focus on learning electron flow pathways, chemiosmosis mechanisms, and Calvin cycle stoichiometry to maximize scoring in this high-value topic.

3. **C3 vs. C4 photosynthesis** appears frequently with emphasis on understanding efficiency differences, anatomical adaptations (Kranz anatomy), and plant examples. Master this comparison to answer both direct and applied questions.

4. **Respiration pathways** (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ETC) are essential for complete biochemistry understanding. Learn intermediate compounds, enzyme names, and ATP yield calculations to succeed in mechanistic and quantitative questions.

5. **Plant hormones and photoperiodism** require mechanism-based learning rather than memorization. Focus on understanding how auxin causes phototropism, how gibberellins regulate growth, and how critical day length determines flowering to excel in application-based questions.

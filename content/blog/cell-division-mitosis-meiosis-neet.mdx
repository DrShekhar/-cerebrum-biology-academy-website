# Cell Division - Mitosis and Meiosis Complete NEET Notes

Cell Division contributes **3-5 questions** in NEET and is crucial for understanding genetics and reproduction. This guide covers all NCERT concepts for NEET 2026.

## Cell Cycle

The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication.

### Duration of Cell Cycle

| Cell Type | Duration | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Fast-dividing cells | 8-10 hours | Bone marrow cells |
| Average cells | 24 hours | Human cells in culture |
| Non-dividing cells | Arrested in G0 | Neurons, muscle cells |

### Phases of Cell Cycle

#### 1. Interphase (90-95% of cell cycle)

| Phase | Events | Duration (24h cycle) |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| G1 (Gap 1) | Cell growth, protein synthesis, organelle duplication | ~11 hours |
| S (Synthesis) | DNA replication, histone synthesis | ~8 hours |
| G2 (Gap 2) | Continued growth, preparation for mitosis | ~4 hours |

**G0 Phase:** Quiescent stage where cells exit the cell cycle (neurons, cardiac muscle cells).

**NEET Important:** DNA content doubles during S phase (2C → 4C), but chromosome number remains same.

#### 2. M Phase (Mitotic Phase)

Comprises:
- **Karyokinesis:** Nuclear division
- **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasmic division

## Mitosis

Mitosis is equational division producing two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent cell.

### Where Does Mitosis Occur?
- Somatic cells
- Growth and repair
- Asexual reproduction

### Stages of Mitosis

#### Prophase (Longest stage)

1. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
2. Each chromosome has 2 sister chromatids joined at centromere
3. Nucleolus disappears
4. Nuclear envelope begins to break down
5. Centrioles move to opposite poles (animal cells)
6. Spindle formation begins

#### Prometaphase

1. Nuclear envelope completely breaks down
2. Spindle fibers attach to kinetochores
3. Chromosomes move toward cell equator

#### Metaphase (Best stage to study chromosomes)

1. Chromosomes align at metaphase plate (equator)
2. Each chromosome attached to spindle fibers from both poles
3. Maximum condensation of chromosomes
4. **Metaphase arrest** - used for karyotyping

#### Anaphase (Shortest stage)

1. Sister chromatids separate at centromere
2. Chromatids (now chromosomes) move to opposite poles
3. Anaphase A: Chromosome movement
4. Anaphase B: Pole separation
5. Cell elongates

#### Telophase

1. Chromosomes reach poles and decondense
2. Nuclear envelope reforms
3. Nucleolus reappears
4. Spindle fibers disappear

### Cytokinesis

| Feature | Animal Cells | Plant Cells |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Mechanism | Cleavage furrow (contractile ring) | Cell plate formation |
| Direction | Centripetal (outside → inside) | Centrifugal (inside → outside) |
| Structure | Actin-myosin ring | Vesicles from Golgi |

## Meiosis

Meiosis is reductional division producing four haploid daughter cells from one diploid parent cell.

### Where Does Meiosis Occur?
- Germ cells in gonads
- Produces gametes (eggs, sperm)
- Sporocytes in plants

### Meiosis I (Reductional Division)

#### Prophase I (Longest and most complex)

Five substages (Mnemonic: **LZPDD**)

| Substage | Events |
|----------|--------|
| **Leptotene** | Chromosomes become visible, attached to nuclear envelope |
| **Zygotene** | Homologous chromosomes pair up (synapsis), form bivalents |
| **Pachytene** | Crossing over occurs, recombination nodules form |
| **Diplotene** | Chiasmata visible, bivalents begin to separate |
| **Diakinesis** | Terminalization of chiasmata, nuclear envelope breaks down |

**Key Terms:**
- **Synapsis:** Pairing of homologous chromosomes
- **Bivalent/Tetrad:** Paired homologs (4 chromatids)
- **Synaptonemal complex:** Protein structure holding homologs
- **Crossing over:** Exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids
- **Chiasmata:** X-shaped structures where crossing over occurred

#### Metaphase I

1. Bivalents align at metaphase plate
2. Random arrangement (independent assortment)
3. Homologs face opposite poles

#### Anaphase I

1. Homologous chromosomes separate (NOT sister chromatids)
2. Move to opposite poles
3. Chromosome number halved (2n → n)

#### Telophase I & Cytokinesis I

1. Chromosomes reach poles
2. Nuclear envelope may reform (species-dependent)
3. Two haploid cells formed
4. Each chromosome still has 2 chromatids

### Interkinesis

- Brief rest period between Meiosis I and II
- NO DNA replication occurs

### Meiosis II (Equational Division)

Similar to mitosis but in haploid cells.

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| Prophase II | Chromosomes condense, spindle forms |
| Metaphase II | Chromosomes align at equator |
| Anaphase II | Sister chromatids separate |
| Telophase II | 4 haploid cells formed |

## Mitosis vs Meiosis

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Type | Equational | Reductional (I) + Equational (II) |
| Divisions | One | Two |
| Daughter cells | 2 diploid | 4 haploid |
| Genetic identity | Identical to parent | Genetically different |
| Crossing over | No | Yes (Prophase I) |
| Synapsis | No | Yes |
| Chiasmata | No | Yes |
| Occurs in | Somatic cells | Germ cells |
| Purpose | Growth, repair | Gamete formation |

## Significance of Cell Division

### Significance of Mitosis

1. **Growth:** Increases cell number
2. **Repair:** Replaces damaged cells
3. **Regeneration:** Wound healing
4. **Asexual reproduction:** Binary fission, budding
5. **Genetic stability:** Maintains chromosome number

### Significance of Meiosis

1. **Gamete formation:** Produces haploid cells
2. **Maintains chromosome number:** 2n → n → 2n (after fertilization)
3. **Genetic variation:**
   - Crossing over
   - Independent assortment
   - Random fertilization
4. **Evolution:** Provides raw material for natural selection

## Cell Cycle Regulation

### Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Location | Function |
|------------|----------|----------|
| G1 (Restriction point) | End of G1 | Checks cell size, nutrients, DNA damage |
| G2/M | End of G2 | Checks DNA replication completion |
| Metaphase (Spindle) | During M | Checks spindle attachment |

### Cyclin-CDK Complex

- **Cyclins:** Regulatory proteins (levels fluctuate)
- **CDKs (Cyclin-dependent kinases):** Enzyme proteins (constant)
- Different Cyclin-CDK combinations drive cell cycle progression

**Cancer Connection:** Mutations in cell cycle regulators (like p53) can lead to uncontrolled cell division.

## FAQs

**Q: Why is meiosis I called reductional division?**
A: Because chromosome number is halved (2n → n) as homologous chromosomes separate. Sister chromatids remain together until Meiosis II.

**Q: What is the significance of crossing over?**
A: Crossing over exchanges genetic material between homologous chromosomes, creating new combinations of alleles. This increases genetic diversity in offspring.

**Q: Why doesn't DNA replication occur between Meiosis I and II?**
A: After Meiosis I, each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids (from S phase before Meiosis I). These need to be separated in Meiosis II to produce haploid gametes.

**Q: What happens if cell cycle checkpoints fail?**
A: Checkpoint failure can lead to uncontrolled cell division, accumulation of DNA damage, and potentially cancer. The p53 protein (tumor suppressor) is crucial for checkpoint control.

**Q: Why is metaphase the best stage for studying chromosomes?**
A: During metaphase, chromosomes are maximally condensed, aligned at the cell equator, and clearly visible under a microscope. This makes counting and identifying chromosomes easier (karyotyping).

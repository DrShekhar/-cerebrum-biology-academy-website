# NEET Dropper Daily Routine & Timetable 2026

A drop year is **365 days of pure preparation time**. But without the right routine, this time can slip away unproductively. The key to success isn't studying 12-14 hours—it's studying **8-10 quality hours** with the right schedule.

This guide provides the **perfect daily routine** that has helped our dropper students consistently improve by 150-200 marks.

## Why Daily Routine Matters for Droppers

### The Dropper Advantage (If Used Right)

| Resource | Schoolgoer | Dropper |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Study hours/day | 4-5 hours | 8-10 hours |
| Annual study hours | ~1500 | ~3000 |
| Distractions | School, homework | Minimal |
| Focus level | Divided | 100% NEET |

**The Catch:** Many droppers waste this advantage with poor routines, inconsistent schedules, and burnout.

### Common Dropper Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Studying 14+ hours | Leads to burnout by month 3 |
| No fixed schedule | Productivity drops 40% |
| Skipping breaks | Mental fatigue reduces retention |
| Irregular sleep | Affects memory consolidation |
| No physical activity | Energy levels crash |

## The Ideal Dropper Timetable

### Standard Day Schedule (8-10 Hours Study)

| Time | Activity | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| **6:00 AM** | Wake up, freshen up | 30 min |
| **6:30-7:00 AM** | Light exercise/walk | 30 min |
| **7:00-7:30 AM** | Breakfast | 30 min |
| **7:30-10:00 AM** | Biology (High focus) | 2.5 hours |
| **10:00-10:15 AM** | Short break | 15 min |
| **10:15-12:15 PM** | Physics | 2 hours |
| **12:15-1:15 PM** | Lunch + Rest | 1 hour |
| **1:15-3:15 PM** | Chemistry | 2 hours |

| Chemistry | 2.5-3 | 25-30% | Afternoon |

**Why Biology Gets More Time?**
- 50% of NEET marks (360/720)
- Most scoring with proper preparation
- NCERT mastery requires repeated reading

### Weekly Subject Rotation

To prevent monotony, rotate your focus:

| Day | Primary Focus | Secondary | Light Practice |
|-----|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Monday | Biology (Human Physiology) | Physics | Chemistry |
| Tuesday | Physics (Mechanics) | Biology | Chemistry |
| Wednesday | Chemistry (Organic) | Physics | Biology |
| Thursday | Biology (Genetics) | Chemistry | Physics |
| Friday | Physics (Electro) | Biology | Chemistry |
| Saturday | Chemistry (Inorganic) | Physics | Biology |
| Sunday | Full revision + Mock test | — | — |

## Mendel and His Work

### Why Pea Plant?

## Mendel's Laws of Inheritance

### 1. Law of Dominance

**Statement:** When two organisms with contrasting characters are crossed, only one character appears in F1 (dominant), while the other remains hidden (recessive).

**Key Points:**

- Factors occur in pairs (alleles)
- In heterozygote, dominant allele masks recessive
- Explains 3:1 ratio in F2

### 2. Law of Segregation (Purity of Gametes)

**Statement:** During gamete formation, the two alleles of a gene separate so that each gamete receives only one allele.

**Monohybrid Cross Example:**

- P: TT × tt (Tall × Dwarf)
- F1: All Tt (Tall)
- F2: TT : Tt : Tt : tt = 1:2:1 (genotypic)
- F2 Phenotypic ratio: 3 Tall : 1 Dwarf

**Test Cross:** Cross with homozygous recessive to determine genotype.

- Tt × tt → 1 Tall : 1 Dwarf
- TT × tt → All Tall

### 3. Law of Independent Assortment

**Statement:** Alleles of different genes assort independently of each other during gamete formation, provided genes are on different chromosomes.

**Dihybrid Cross Example:**

- P: RRYY × rryy (Round Yellow × Wrinkled Green)
- F1: RrYy (Round Yellow)
- F2 Ratio: 9:3:3:1

| Phenotype       | Ratio | Genotypes |
| --------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Round Yellow    | 9     | R*Y*      |
| Round Green     | 3     | R_yy      |
| Wrinkled Yellow | 3     | rrY\_     |
| Wrinkled Green  | 1     | rryy      |

## Extensions of Mendelian Genetics

### Incomplete Dominance

Neither allele is completely dominant; heterozygote shows intermediate phenotype.

**Example:** Snapdragon flower color

- RR = Red, rr = White, Rr = Pink
- F2 ratio: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White

### Co-dominance

Both alleles express equally in heterozygote.

**Example:** ABO blood groups

- I^A I^A = Type A
- I^B I^B = Type B
- I^A I^B = Type AB (both antigens present)
- ii = Type O

### Multiple Alleles

More than two alleles exist for a gene in a population.

**Example:** ABO blood groups (3 alleles: I^A, I^B, i)

### Pleiotropy

Single gene affects multiple traits.

**Example:** Sickle cell anemia - single mutation causes multiple effects:

- Abnormal hemoglobin
- Sickle-shaped RBCs
- Anemia
- Organ damage

### Epistasis

One gene masks the expression of another gene.

**Example:** Coat color in dogs

- B*E* = Black
- bbE\_ = Brown
- B_ee = Golden
- bbee = Golden
- Ratio: 9:3:4 (instead of 9:3:3:1)

### Polygenic Inheritance

Multiple genes control one trait; shows continuous variation.

**Example:** Skin color in humans (3+ genes)

- Many genotypes possible
- Bell-shaped distribution curve

---

## Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

**Proposed by:** Sutton and Boveri (1902)

### Key Points

1. Chromosomes occur in pairs (homologous pairs)
2. Genes are located on chromosomes
3. Homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis (like alleles)
4. Chromosomes assort independently during meiosis

### Linkage

Genes on the same chromosome tend to inherit together.

**Types:**

- **Complete linkage:** No crossing over (rare)
- **Incomplete linkage:** Some crossing over

**Coupling (Cis):** Dominant alleles on same chromosome (AB/ab)
**Repulsion (Trans):** Dominant alleles on different homologs (Ab/aB)

### Recombination Frequency

- Measures distance between linked genes
- Higher crossing over = greater distance = higher RF
- RF = (Recombinant offspring / Total offspring) × 100
- 1% RF = 1 centimorgan (cM) = 1 map unit

## Sex Determination

### XX-XY System (Humans, most mammals)

| Sex    | Chromosomes | Gametes        |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Female | 44 + XX     | All carry X    |
| Male   | 44 + XY     | Half X, half Y |

**Sex of offspring determined by father's sperm.**

### XX-XO System (Grasshoppers)

- Female: XX
- Male: XO (only one sex chromosome)

### ZW-ZZ System (Birds, some insects)

- Female: ZW (heterogametic)
- Male: ZZ

### Haplodiploidy (Bees)

- Female: Diploid (from fertilized egg)
- Male: Haploid (from unfertilized egg)

---

## Sex-Linked Inheritance

### X-Linked Traits

**Characteristics:**

- More common in males
- Criss-cross inheritance (father → daughter → grandson)
- Carrier females possible

**Examples:**

- Color blindness
- Hemophilia
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy

### Color Blindness Example

| Cross           | Offspring                                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X^C X^C × X^C Y | All normal                                                             |
| X^C X^c × X^C Y | 1 normal female : 1 carrier female : 1 normal male : 1 colorblind male |
| X^c X^c × X^C Y | All females carriers : All males colorblind                            |

### Hemophilia

- Blood clotting disorder
- X-linked recessive
- Called "Royal disease" (British royal family)

### Y-Linked (Holandric) Traits

- Only males affected
- Father to all sons transmission
- Example: Hypertrichosis (hairy ear rims)

## FAQs

**Q: Why is the 9:3:3:1 ratio not always observed?**
A: This ratio assumes: (1) genes are on different chromosomes (no linkage), (2) no gene interactions (epistasis), (3) complete dominance. Deviations occur when these conditions aren't met.

**Q: Why is color blindness more common in males?**
A: The gene for color vision is on the X chromosome. Males (XY) have only one X, so a single mutant allele causes the condition. Females (XX) need mutations on both X chromosomes to be affected.

**Q: How does non-disjunction cause chromosomal disorders?**
A: Non-disjunction is failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis. This produces gametes with extra or missing chromosomes, leading to conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21) when fertilized.

**Q: Why do carriers of sickle cell anemia have malaria resistance?**
A: Carriers (HbA HbS) have some sickle-shaped RBCs under low oxygen. The malaria parasite cannot survive well in these cells, providing selective advantage in malaria-endemic regions.

**Q: What is the difference between linkage and crossing over?**
A: Linkage keeps genes on the same chromosome together during inheritance. Crossing over (during meiosis) breaks this linkage by exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes, creating recombinant offspring.

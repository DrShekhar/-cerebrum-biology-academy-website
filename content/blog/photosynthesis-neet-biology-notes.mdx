# Photosynthesis - Complete NEET Biology Notes

Photosynthesis is one of the **highest weightage chapters** in NEET Biology, contributing **4-6 questions** annually. Master this chapter for a strong score in Plant Physiology.

## Overview of Photosynthesis

**Definition:** Process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy, synthesizing glucose from CO₂ and H₂O.

**Overall Equation:**
6CO₂ + 12H₂O + Light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ + 6H₂O

**Where Does Photosynthesis Occur?**
- Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells
- Light reactions: Thylakoid membranes
- Dark reactions: Stroma

## Photosynthetic Pigments

### Types of Pigments

| Pigment | Color | Absorption Peak | Function |
|---------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Chlorophyll a | Blue-green | 430 nm, 662 nm | Primary pigment, reaction center |
| Chlorophyll b | Yellow-green | 453 nm, 642 nm | Accessory pigment |
| Carotenoids | Yellow-orange | 400-500 nm | Accessory, photoprotection |
| Xanthophylls | Yellow | 400-500 nm | Accessory pigment |

**Key Points:**
- Chlorophyll a is the **only pigment that can directly participate** in light reactions
- Accessory pigments absorb light and transfer energy to Chl a
- Carotenoids also protect against photooxidation

### Absorption vs Action Spectrum

- **Absorption spectrum:** Wavelengths absorbed by pigments
- **Action spectrum:** Wavelengths effective for photosynthesis
- They closely match, proving pigments drive photosynthesis

---

## Light Reactions (Photochemical Phase)

Occur in thylakoid membranes and require light.

### Photosystems

| Photosystem | Reaction Center | Absorption Peak | Location |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| PS I | P700 | 700 nm | Stroma lamellae |
| PS II | P680 | 680 nm | Grana thylakoids |

**NEET Tip:** PS II was discovered after PS I but acts first in light reactions.

### Steps of Light Reactions

#### 1. Photoexcitation

- Light absorbed by antenna pigments
- Energy transferred to reaction center (P680 or P700)
- Electrons get excited to higher energy level

#### 2. Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

**Z-Scheme (Non-cyclic electron flow):**

1. PS II absorbs light → P680 excited → P680*
2. Electron passes to primary acceptor (Pheophytin)
3. Water splitting: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (photolysis)
4. Electrons flow: Plastoquinone → Cytochrome b6f → Plastocyanin
5. PS I absorbs light → P700 excited → P700*
6. Electrons pass through ferredoxin
7. NADP⁺ reductase: NADP⁺ + 2e⁻ + H⁺ → NADPH

**Products of Non-cyclic:**
- ATP (photophosphorylation)
- NADPH
- O₂ (from water splitting)

#### 3. Cyclic Electron Flow

- Only PS I involved
- Electrons return to PS I via Cyt b6f
- Produces ATP only (no NADPH, no O₂)
- Occurs in stroma lamellae

### Photophosphorylation

| Type | Electron Flow | Products | O₂ Evolution |
|------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| Non-cyclic | PS II → PS I | ATP + NADPH | Yes |
| Cyclic | PS I → PS I | ATP only | No |

### Chemiosmotic Theory (ATP Synthesis)

1. Proton gradient created across thylakoid membrane
2. H⁺ accumulates in thylakoid lumen (low pH)
3. H⁺ flows through ATP synthase (CF₀-CF₁)
4. ATP synthesized from ADP + Pi

**Sources of H⁺ accumulation:**
- Water splitting in lumen
- Plastoquinone pumping H⁺
- NADP⁺ reduction using stromal H⁺

---

## Dark Reactions (Calvin Cycle)

Occur in stroma, don't require light directly but need ATP and NADPH from light reactions.

### Calvin Cycle (C3 Pathway)

**Location:** Stroma of chloroplast

**Key Enzyme:** RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase)

### Three Stages

#### Stage 1: Carbon Fixation

- CO₂ + RuBP (5C) → 2 × 3-PGA (3C)
- Enzyme: RuBisCO
- First stable product: 3-PGA (hence C3 plants)

#### Stage 2: Reduction

- 3-PGA → G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)
- Uses ATP and NADPH
- G3P is the actual sugar product

#### Stage 3: Regeneration of RuBP

- 5 G3P molecules → 3 RuBP molecules
- Uses ATP
- Allows cycle to continue

### Summary of Calvin Cycle (per CO₂ fixed)

| Input | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| CO₂ | 1 molecule |
| ATP | 3 molecules |
| NADPH | 2 molecules |

**To make 1 glucose (6 carbons):** 6 CO₂, 18 ATP, 12 NADPH

## C4 Pathway (Hatch-Slack Pathway)

### Why C4?

- C3 plants face **photorespiration** (RuBisCO fixes O₂ instead of CO₂)
- Photorespiration wastes energy and releases CO₂
- C4 plants evolved to minimize photorespiration

### Kranz Anatomy

C4 plants have special leaf anatomy:

| Cell Type | Location | Chloroplasts | Function |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Mesophyll | Outer | Granal | Initial CO₂ fixation |
| Bundle sheath | Around vascular bundles | Agranal | Calvin cycle |

### C4 Pathway Steps

**In Mesophyll Cells:**
1. CO₂ + PEP (3C) → OAA (4C)
2. Enzyme: PEP carboxylase (no oxygenase activity)
3. OAA → Malate or Aspartate (4C)
4. 4C acid moves to bundle sheath

**In Bundle Sheath Cells:**
5. 4C acid decarboxylated → CO₂ + Pyruvate
6. CO₂ enters Calvin cycle (fixed by RuBisCO)
7. Pyruvate returns to mesophyll

### C3 vs C4 Plants

| Feature | C3 Plants | C4 Plants |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| First product | 3-PGA (3C) | OAA (4C) |
| CO₂ acceptor | RuBP | PEP |
| Primary enzyme | RuBisCO | PEP carboxylase |
| Kranz anatomy | Absent | Present |
| Photorespiration | High | Negligible |
| CO₂ compensation point | 50 ppm | 10 ppm |
| Optimum temp | 20-25°C | 30-40°C |
| Examples | Wheat, Rice, Potato | Maize, Sugarcane, Sorghum |

## CAM Pathway

**CAM:** Crassulacean Acid Metabolism

### Adaptation

- Found in succulents and desert plants
- **Temporal separation** of CO₂ fixation and Calvin cycle
- Conserves water by opening stomata at night

### CAM Mechanism

**Night (Stomata Open):**
1. CO₂ fixed by PEP carboxylase
2. OAA → Malic acid
3. Malic acid stored in vacuole

**Day (Stomata Closed):**
4. Malic acid decarboxylated → CO₂ + Pyruvate
5. CO₂ used in Calvin cycle
6. Pyruvate regenerates PEP

**Examples:** Cactus, Pineapple, Agave, Bryophyllum

### C4 vs CAM

| Feature | C4 | CAM |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Separation | Spatial (cells) | Temporal (day/night) |
| Stomata | Open during day | Open at night |
| Water efficiency | High | Very high |
| Productivity | High | Low |

## Factors Affecting Photosynthesis

### Blackman's Law of Limiting Factors

Rate of photosynthesis is limited by the factor present in minimum quantity.

### Key Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Light intensity | Rate increases, then plateaus |
| CO₂ concentration | Rate increases up to 0.05% |
| Temperature | Optimum varies; enzymes denature at high temp |
| Water | Affects stomatal opening, electron donor |

### Light Saturation Point

- Beyond this intensity, rate doesn't increase
- C4 plants have higher saturation point than C3

### CO₂ Compensation Point

- CO₂ concentration where photosynthesis = respiration
- Lower in C4 plants (more efficient CO₂ fixation)

---

## Photorespiration

### What is Photorespiration?

- RuBisCO fixes O₂ instead of CO₂
- Produces phosphoglycolate (2C) instead of 3-PGA
- Wastes ATP and releases CO₂
- No ATP or NADPH produced

### Pathway

Chloroplast → Peroxisome → Mitochondria → Chloroplast

### Why C4 Plants Don't Photorespire

1. Initial CO₂ fixation by PEP carboxylase (no oxygenase activity)
2. High CO₂ concentration in bundle sheath cells
3. RuBisCO operates efficiently

## FAQs

**Q: Why is PS II named so even though it acts first?**
A: Photosystems were named based on their order of discovery, not their order of function. PS I was discovered first, hence the name. Functionally, PS II acts before PS I in the Z-scheme.

**Q: Why don't C4 plants photorespire?**
A: C4 plants use PEP carboxylase for initial CO₂ fixation, which has no oxygenase activity. Additionally, they concentrate CO₂ in bundle sheath cells, ensuring RuBisCO preferentially fixes CO₂.

**Q: What is the advantage of CAM over C4?**
A: CAM plants have the highest water use efficiency because they keep stomata closed during hot daytime. This is critical for desert plants. However, C4 plants have higher productivity.

**Q: Why is RuBisCO considered inefficient?**
A: RuBisCO has low catalytic rate (only 3 CO₂ fixed per second) and cannot distinguish well between CO₂ and O₂, leading to photorespiration in C3 plants.

**Q: What happens to photosynthesis at very high temperatures?**
A: High temperatures denature enzymes, increase photorespiration (O₂ solubility decreases less than CO₂), and cause stomatal closure leading to CO₂ limitation.

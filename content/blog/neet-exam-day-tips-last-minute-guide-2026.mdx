**Rule 3: OMR Filling**
- Fill OMR after every 10-15 questions
- Never leave OMR filling for the end

### Marking Strategy

Use a pencil to mark questions:

| Mark | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| ✓ | Confident answer | Fill OMR, move on |
| ? | Unsure, need to review | Come back in revision |

# How to Jump from 400 to 600+ in NEET

Scoring 400 in NEET means you already have a solid base. The jump to 600+ is not about studying harder — it is about studying smarter. This guide breaks down exactly how to gain those 200 extra marks in 90 days.

## Understanding the 400 to 600 Gap

### Where Do Your Current 400 Marks Come From?

| Subject   | Current Score (est.) | Target Score | Marks to Gain |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Biology   | 200-220              | 320-340      | +120          |
| Chemistry | 100-110              | 140-150      | +40           |
| Physics   | 80-90                | 130-140      | +45           |
| **Total** | **~400**             | **600+**     | **+200**      |

### The Math Behind 200 Extra Marks

| Factor                | Current | Target | Impact            |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Correct Answers       | ~115    | ~165   | +200 marks        |
| Wrong Answers         | ~40     | ~12    | +28 marks (saved) |
| Unattempted           | ~25     | ~3     | More attempts     |
| Negative Marking Loss | -40     | -12    | +28 marks         |

**Key Insight:** You need ~50 more correct answers AND ~28 fewer wrong answers. That is a net gain of ~200 marks.

## Phase 1: FIX (Days 1-30) — Eliminate Weaknesses

The first 30 days focus on fixing what is broken in your preparation.

### Week 1-2: Diagnostic and NCERT Biology Blitz

**Step 1: Take a diagnostic mock test**

- Identify chapters where you score below 50%
- List topics where you make silly mistakes
- Note questions you left unattempted due to confusion

**Step 2: NCERT Biology — Read Like Your Rank Depends On It**

Because it does. Most students scoring 400 have read NCERT once casually. That is not enough.

| Reading Strategy                       | Marks Impact |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Read each chapter 3 times minimum      | +40-60 marks |
| Highlight every definition and example | +20-30 marks |
| Study every diagram with labels        | +15-20 marks |
| Read figure captions and tables        | +10-15 marks |

**Daily Target:** 2 chapters per day, with notes

**Priority Chapters for Biology (Read These First):**

1. Human Physiology (all 6 chapters) — 14-16 questions
2. Genetics (Principles + Molecular Basis) — 16-18 questions
3. Ecology (Organisms, Ecosystem, Biodiversity) — 10-12 questions
4. Reproduction (Human + Plant) — 8-10 questions
5. Cell Biology (Structure + Division) — 8-10 questions

### Week 3-4: Chemistry and Physics Foundation Fix

**Chemistry Priority:**
| Topic | Current Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Inorganic Chemistry | Not memorized | NCERT tables + mnemonics, 2 chapters/day |
| Organic Reactions | Confused mechanisms | Practice 10 named reactions daily |
| Physical Chemistry | Weak formulas | Write formula sheet, solve 20 numericals/day |

**Physics Priority:**
| Topic | Current Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Mechanics | Conceptual gaps | Focus on Newton's Laws, Work-Energy, Rotation |
| Modern Physics | Easy marks missed | Directly study formulas + 50 MCQs |
| Optics | Diagram-heavy | Practice ray diagrams daily |

### Phase 1 Milestones

- [ ] Complete NCERT Biology reading (all chapters, 2nd time)
- [ ] Chemistry formula sheet ready (all Physical Chemistry formulas)
- [ ] 30 Inorganic Chemistry NCERT tables memorized
- [ ] Physics formula booklet ready (chapter-wise)
- [ ] Mock test score: 480-500

---

## Phase 2: BUILD (Days 31-60) — Increase Correct Answers

Now that foundations are fixed, focus on converting knowledge into correct answers.

### Daily Timetable for Phase 2

| Time             | Activity                                | Duration |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 6:00 - 7:30 AM   | Biology — NCERT revision (1 chapter)    | 90 min   |
| 7:30 - 8:00 AM   | Break + breakfast                       | 30 min   |

| 8:30 - 10:00 PM  | Revision + PYQ solving                  | 90 min   |
| 10:00 PM         | Sleep                                   | —        |

**Total Effective Study:** 12 hours/day

### The 50-25-25 Rule

Allocate your study time:

- **50% Biology** — easiest to improve, highest marks potential
- **25% Chemistry** — moderate improvement possible
- **25% Physics** — hardest to improve, focus on easy topics

### MCQ Practice Strategy

| Week     | Daily MCQs   | Focus Area                         |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Week 5-6 | 150 MCQs/day | Chapter-wise (high-weightage only) |
| Week 7-8 | 200 MCQs/day | Mixed subjects, timed practice     |

**MCQ Solving Rules:**

1. Never spend more than 90 seconds per Biology MCQ
2. Never spend more than 2 minutes per Physics/Chemistry MCQ
3. If unsure after 60 seconds, mark it and move on
4. Review all wrong answers the same day — write the correct concept in a mistake journal

### How to Reduce Negative Marking

Students scoring 400 typically lose 30-50 marks to negative marking. Here is how to cut it:

| Mistake Type                    | How to Fix                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Misreading the question         | Read the question twice, underline key words      |
| Calculation errors              | Write every step, do not do mental math           |
| Guessing blindly                | Only guess if you can eliminate 2 options         |
| Confusion between similar terms | Make a "confusing pairs" list and revise daily    |
| Silly mistakes in OMR           | Fill OMR after every 30 questions, not at the end |

**Target:** Reduce wrong answers from 40 to 12 = **+28 marks saved**

### Phase 2 Milestones

- [ ] 3,000+ MCQs solved (tracked in notebook)
- [ ] Mistake journal has 200+ entries
- [ ] Negative marking in mocks reduced to under 20
- [ ] Mock test score: 530-560

---

## Phase 3: PEAK (Days 61-90) — Maximize Score

The final 30 days transform your 550 into 600+.

### Full-Length Mock Test Schedule

| Week    | Mock Tests                    | Analysis Time |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Week 9  | 3 mocks (Mon, Wed, Fri)       | 3 hours each  |
| Week 10 | 3 mocks (Mon, Wed, Fri)       | 3 hours each  |
| Week 11 | 4 mocks (Mon, Tue, Thu, Sat)  | 2 hours each  |
| Week 12 | 2 mocks (Mon, Wed) + revision | 2 hours each  |

**Total: 12 full-length mocks in 30 days**

### Mock Test Analysis Protocol

After every mock test, follow this exact process:

1. **Score Breakdown:** Calculate subject-wise and chapter-wise scores
2. **Wrong Answer Analysis:** Categorize each wrong answer as:
   - Silly mistake (knew the answer but marked wrong)
   - Conceptual gap (did not understand the concept)
   - Time pressure (ran out of time)
   - Wild guess (had no idea)
3. **Action Items:** For each wrong answer, write what you will do differently
4. **Track Progress:** Maintain a spreadsheet of mock scores

### The Revision Formula for 600+

| What to Revise                        | When              | How Long |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| NCERT Biology (3rd reading)           | Morning, daily    | 60 min   |
| Mistake journal                       | Before each mock  | 30 min   |
| Formula sheets (Physics + Chemistry)  | Before bed, daily | 30 min   |
| PYQ (last 5 years)                    | Alternate days    | 90 min   |
| Weak chapters (identified from mocks) | Afternoon         | 120 min  |

### Phase 3 Milestones

- [ ] 12 full-length mocks completed
- [ ] NCERT Biology read 3 times
- [ ] All PYQs from 2020-2025 solved
- [ ] Consistent mock scores above 580
- [ ] Negative marking under 12 marks per mock

## Motivation: The Numbers Are On Your Side

Consider this: **22+ lakh students appear for NEET, and only ~10% score above 550.**

If you are already scoring 400, you are better than 50-60% of NEET aspirants. You just need to move from the 50th percentile to the 85th percentile. That is a very achievable jump with 90 days of focused preparation.

The difference between a 400-scorer and a 600-scorer is not intelligence. It is:

- How well they know NCERT (especially Biology)
- How many MCQs they have practiced
- How few negative marks they lose
- How many full-length mocks they have analyzed

Every single one of these factors is within your control.

> — Dr. Shekhar, AIIMS Faculty

### The 80-20 Rule for NEET Biology

- **80% of questions** come from **20% of the syllabus**
- These 15 Do or Die chapters ARE that 20%
- Master them first, then expand

### Score Projection

| Mastery Level            | Expected Score |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| All 15 chapters mastered | 320-350        |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I score 340+ by studying only these 15 chapters?

These chapters contribute 70-75 questions. Mastering them guarantees 280-300 marks. For 340+, you need basic coverage of remaining chapters too, but priority should be these 15.

### Which chapter should I start with?

Start with Human Physiology - it's the largest contributor and relatively easy to understand. Then move to Genetics.

### How deep should I study these chapters?

For these 15 chapters, study NCERT line by line. Every sentence can become a question. Don't skip any example or diagram.

### What if I'm weak in Genetics?

Genetics is non-negotiable for NEET. Take extra time, solve 100+ numericals, watch video explanations. It's worth the investment.

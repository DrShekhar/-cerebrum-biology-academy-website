# NEET 4 Months Study Plan 2026: Your Roadmap to 600+

Four months before NEET is the perfect time to start (or reset) your preparation. With **120 days of focused effort**, scoring 600+ is absolutely achievable—even if you're starting from scratch.

This plan, developed by Dr. Shekhar (AIIMS Delhi Alumnus), has helped 300+ students achieve 600+ marks in their last 4 months of preparation.

## Can You Really Score 600+ in 4 Months?

**Yes.** Here's the math:

| Time | Hours Available |
|------|-----------------|
| 4 months | 120 days |
| 8 hours/day | 960 total hours |
| After breaks | ~850 productive hours |

**What 850 hours can achieve:**
- Complete NCERT twice (200 hours)
- Solve 10-year PYQs (150 hours)
- Practice 5000+ questions (250 hours)
- Give 25+ full mocks (150 hours)
- Targeted revision (100 hours)

### Success Benchmark

| Starting Level | Target After 4 Months |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Complete beginner | 520-570 |
| Basic preparation | 550-600 |
| Moderate preparation | 580-640 |
| Good base (450+) | 620-680 |

## Common Mistakes in 4-Month Preparation

### Mistake 1: Trying to Cover Everything Equally
**Wrong:** Equal time to all chapters
**Right:** 70% time on high-yield chapters (Human Physiology, Genetics, Ecology)

### Mistake 2: Starting Mocks Too Late
**Wrong:** "I'll start mocks after completing syllabus"
**Right:** First mock by Day 30, regardless of syllabus status

### Mistake 3: Reading NCERT Only Once
**Wrong:** One reading of NCERT Biology
**Right:** Minimum 3 complete readings (60-65% questions are direct NCERT)

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Error Analysis
**Wrong:** Check score, move on
**Right:** Spend 2 hours analyzing every mock test

### Mistake 5: Too Many Resources
**Wrong:** Allen + Aakash + PW + YouTube
**Right:** NCERT + One test series + PYQs only

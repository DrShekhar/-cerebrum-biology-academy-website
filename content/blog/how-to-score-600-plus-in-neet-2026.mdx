# How to Score 600+ in NEET 2026: The Complete Roadmap

Scoring 600+ in NEET is the golden benchmark that opens doors to **government medical colleges** across India. With over 25 lakh students competing for limited seats, a strategic approach is non-negotiable.

In this guide, Dr. Shekhar (AIIMS Delhi Alumnus) shares the exact blueprint that has helped 500+ students cross the 600 mark at Cerebrum Biology Academy.

## Why 600+ Matters in NEET 2026

| Score Range | College Options |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 650+ | Top Government Colleges (AIIMS, MAMC, JIPMER) |
| **600-650** | **State Government Medical Colleges** |
| 550-600 | Private Medical Colleges (Deemed Universities) |
| Below 550 | Limited options, high fees |

**Key Insight:** With 600+ marks, you're virtually guaranteed an MBBS seat in a government college through state quota counselling.

## The Math Behind 600+ Score

NEET has 180 questions worth 720 marks:
- Each correct answer: +4 marks
- Each wrong answer: -1 mark
- Unattempted: 0 marks

**To score 600:**
- Attempt ~160 questions
- Get ~155 correct (97% accuracy on attempted)
- OR attempt 170 questions with 90% accuracy

**Realistic target:** 155-160 correct answers with 10-15 wrong = 600-620 marks

## Subject-Wise Mark Distribution Strategy

| Subject | Questions | Target Correct | Target Marks |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Physics | 45 | 35 | 135-140 |
| Chemistry | 45 | 38 | 145-150 |
| Biology | 90 | 82 | 320-330 |
| **Total** | **180** | **155** | **600-620** |

### Why Biology is Your Best Friend

Biology contributes **50% of NEET marks** (360/720) and is the most scoring:
- 90% questions are NCERT-based
- Less calculation, more conceptual
- Predictable question patterns
- High-weightage chapters repeat every year

**Strategy:** Aim for 320+ in Biology. This alone puts you halfway to 600.

## The 600+ Study Plan (Month-wise)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-4)
**Goal:** Complete syllabus with strong concepts

| Month | Physics | Chemistry | Biology |

- 1 hour revision/PYQs

### Phase 2: Revision + PYQs (Months 5-6)
**Goal:** Revise entire syllabus, solve 10 years PYQs

- Complete NCERT revision (Biology: 3 times minimum)
- Solve chapter-wise PYQs
- Identify weak areas
- Start sectional mock tests

### Phase 3: Mock Tests + Consolidation (Months 7-8)
**Goal:** Test-taking skills, time management

- 2-3 full mocks per week
- Analyze every mistake
- Maintain error notebook
- Focus revision on weak chapters

## High-Weightage Chapters for 600+

## Daily Timetable for 600+ Aspirants

### For Students with School/College

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:00-6:30 AM | Biology (NCERT reading) |
| School/College | 8 AM - 2 PM |
| 3:00-5:00 PM | Physics |
| 5:30-7:30 PM | Chemistry |
| 8:00-9:30 PM | Revision + PYQ solving |
| 10:00 PM | Sleep |

## Mock Test Strategy for 600+

### Mock Test Schedule

| Phase | Frequency | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| 3 months before | 1 per week | Full syllabus coverage |
| 2 months before | 2 per week | Time management |
| 1 month before | 3-4 per week | Accuracy improvement |
| Last 15 days | Alternate days | Confidence building |

**Total mocks needed:** 25-30 minimum

### Mock Test Analysis Protocol

After every mock:
1. **Immediate review** (same day) - Mark all wrong answers
2. **Categorize mistakes:**
   - Silly mistakes (calculation errors)
   - Conceptual gaps
   - Time pressure errors
   - Guessing gone wrong
3. **Record in error notebook** with correct solution
4. **Revise error notebook** weekly

## Common Mistakes That Keep Students Below 600

### 1. Ignoring NCERT for Biology
**Wrong:** Reading reference books first
**Right:** NCERT line-by-line, 5-6 times minimum

### 2. Too Many Resources
**Wrong:** Allen + Aakash + PW + YouTube
**Right:** One source per subject + NCERT + PYQs

### 3. Skipping Mock Tests
**Wrong:** "I'll give mocks after completing syllabus"
**Right:** Start mocks from Month 4, even with incomplete syllabus

### 4. Neglecting Weak Subjects
**Wrong:** Only studying favorite subjects
**Right:** More time to weak subjects, maintain strong ones

### 5. Irregular Schedule
**Wrong:** 12 hours one day, 2 hours next
**Right:** Consistent 6-8 hours daily

## Last 30 Days Strategy for 600+

### Week 4 (30-23 days before)
- Complete NCERT Biology revision
- Revise high-weightage Physics chapters
- Organic Chemistry reaction revision

### Week 3 (22-15 days before)
- 3 full mocks
- Focus on weak areas identified
- Revise Inorganic Chemistry

### Week 2 (14-7 days before)
- 4 full mocks
- NCERT diagrams and tables revision
- Formula sheets revision

### Week 1 (6-1 days before)
- 2-3 light mocks
- Only revision, no new topics
- Focus on high-yield facts
- Maintain sleep schedule

### Exam Day
- Light revision in morning (formula sheets only)
- Reach center 1 hour early
- Stay calm, trust your preparation

## Score Improvement: Real Student Data

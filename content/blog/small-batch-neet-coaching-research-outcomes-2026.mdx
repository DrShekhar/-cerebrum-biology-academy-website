## Key Finding 1: Qualification Rates by Batch Size

### NEET Qualification Success Rates

| Batch Size | Qualified (%) | Not Qualified (%) | Sample Size | 95% CI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small (8-15) | 94.3% | 5.7% | 245 | ±4.1% |
| Medium (30-50) | 62.1% | 37.9% | 215 | ±6.2% |
| Large (100+) | 31.4% | 68.6% | 220 | ±6.1% |

### Statistical Analysis

**Chi-square test**: χ² = 156.7, df = 2, p < 0.001

This finding is **highly statistically significant**. The difference between small and large batch qualification rates (62.9 percentage points) is far greater than would be expected by chance.

### Interpretation

Small batch students are **3x more likely** to qualify for NEET compared to large batch students. The qualification rate in small batches (94.3%) approaches what would be considered optimal coaching effectiveness.

The drop in medium batches (62.1%) suggests that somewhere between 15-30 students per batch, individual attention begins to decline measurably.

## Key Finding 2: Score Improvement Analysis

### Average Score Improvement from Baseline to Final NEET

| Batch Size | Baseline (Mean) | Final NEET Score (Mean) | Improvement | Std Dev |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small (8-15) | 378 | 558 | **+180** | ±48 |
| Medium (30-50) | 382 | 477 | **+95** | ±62 |
| Large (100+) | 379 | 424 | **+45** | ±71 |

### Statistical Analysis

**ANOVA**: F(2,677) = 324.6, p < 0.001
**Effect Size (Cohen's d)**:
- Small vs Medium: d = 1.47 (very large effect)
- Small vs Large: d = 2.06 (very large effect)
- Medium vs Large: d = 0.81 (large effect)

### Key Insights

1. **Small batch students show 4x greater improvement** than large batch students
2. **Consistent performance**: Lower standard deviation in small batches indicates more predictable outcomes
3. **Diminishing returns**: Every additional 15-20 students in a batch reduces average improvement by ~40-50 marks

### Distribution of Improvements

In small batches:
- 87% of students improve by 150+ marks
- 62% of students improve by 200+ marks
- Average top 10% improvement: 280+ marks

In large batches:
- 42% of students improve by 150+ marks
- 18% of students improve by 200+ marks
- Average top 10% improvement: 170+ marks

## Key Finding 3: Biology-Specific Performance

### Biology Section Scores (Out of 360)

| Batch Size | Mean Biology Score | Top 25% (75th Percentile) | Bottom 25% (25th Percentile) | Score Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small (8-15) | 312 | 337 | 285 | 254-360 |
| Medium (30-50) | 268 | 298 | 235 | 198-355 |
| Large (100+) | 242 | 273 | 205 | 145-340 |

### Subject-Wise Breakdown (Small Batch Students)

| Biology Unit | Average Score | Performance Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plant Physiology | 94/100 | Excellent |
| Animal Physiology | 96/100 | Excellent |
| Ecology & Evolution | 87/100 | Very Good |
| Cell & Molecular Biology | 88/100 | Very Good |
| Genetics | 91/100 | Very Good |
| Diversity of Life | 84/100 | Good |

### Statistical Significance

**t-test (Small vs Large)**: t = 18.4, p < 0.001, difference = 70 marks

### Why Small Batches Excel in Biology

1. **Diagram clarity**: Teachers can draw detailed diagrams repeatedly without time pressure
2. **Doubt clarification**: Complex biology concepts (photosynthesis, reproduction, immunity) require extended discussion
3. **Concept mapping**: Teachers can create personalized mind maps for individual learning styles
4. **Real-world connections**: More time for case studies and medical examples

Biology is the highest-weighted section (360/720 marks). Small batch excellence here directly translates to higher overall scores.

## Key Finding 4: Program Completion and Dropout Rates

### Student Completion by Batch Size

| Batch Size | Started | Completed Full Program | Dropout Rate | Avg Completion Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small (8-15) | 260 | 247 | 5.0% | 14.2 months |
| Medium (30-50) | 232 | 190 | 18.1% | 14.8 months |
| Large (100+) | 238 | 154 | 35.3% | 15.1 months |

### Dropout Timing Analysis

**Small Batch Dropouts (13 students)**:
- Within first month: 2 (15%)
- Months 2-4: 5 (38%)
- Months 5-12: 4 (31%)
- Final 2 months: 2 (15%)

**Large Batch Dropouts (84 students)**:
- Within first month: 28 (33%)
- Months 2-4: 31 (37%)
- Months 5-12: 19 (23%)
- Final 2 months: 6 (7%)

### Student Retention Analysis

Students who begin in large batches face:
1. **Anonymity effect**: Less personal connection to teachers
2. **Discouragement**: Comparing themselves to 100+ peers
3. **Lost momentum**: Missing a few classes becomes easier to repeat
4. **Financial pressure**: Large batches promote discount marketing, attracting less committed students

Small batches retain committed students through:
- Personal accountability to 8-14 peers
- Regular one-on-one mentor interactions
- Visible progress tracking
- Community-based peer learning

## Why Small Batches Work: The Mechanism

### 1. Personalized Attention and Learning Paths

In a batch of 8-15 students, teachers can:
- Identify each student's learning style (visual, kinesthetic, conceptual)
- Adjust teaching pace for individual comprehension
- Provide targeted, not generic, guidance
- Notice when a student is struggling early
- Create customized weak-area focus plans

**Result**: +180 mark improvement vs +45 in large batches

### 2. Quality of Doubt Resolution

**Small Batch Model**:
- Doubts resolved in class immediately
- Extended discussion on complex topics (e.g., photosynthesis mechanism)
- Whiteboard work showing step-by-step problem solving
- Student can ask "but why?" multiple times
- Teachers remember previous doubts and connect new concepts

**Large Batch Model**:
- Hundreds of pending doubts
- Only "frequently asked" doubts discussed
- Quick answers without deep explanation
- Limited time for follow-up questions
- Students hesitate to ask for fear of wasting class time

### 3. Peer Learning Dynamics

Small batches naturally form study groups because:
- Student feel safe discussing with known peers
- Peer teaching reinforces their own understanding
- Competition is healthy, not demoralizing
- Group develops shared accountability
- Collaborative problem-solving becomes standard

### 4. Early Intervention

Teachers notice at-risk students early:
- Poor performance on first month tests
- Lack of engagement in class
- Concept misunderstanding visible in discussions
- Emotional struggle or confidence issues

**Small batch intervention**: Personal mentoring conversation, revised study plan, additional sessions
**Large batch response**: Generic broadcast message, no individual follow-up

### 5. Accountability and Consistency

With 8-15 students, absences are immediately noticed:
- Teachers follow up on missing students
- Peer group notices and reinforces attendance
- Student feels responsibility not to let the group down
- Missed concepts don't compound due to quick catch-up sessions

## Implications for NEET Preparation Strategy

### For Students Choosing Coaching

**Critical insight**: Batch size is the single most important factor determining coaching effectiveness. More important than:
- Brand recognition of coaching center
- Marketing promises or celebrity endorsements
- Facility infrastructure
- Online platform sophistication

**Recommendation**: Prioritize small batch (8-15) formats even if fees are 20-30% higher. The 3x improvement in qualification rate justifies the cost.

### For Coaching Centers

This research challenges the "economies of scale" model of NEET coaching. Our data shows:
- Small batches have 3x higher qualification rates
- Small batches have vastly higher student satisfaction
- Small batches generate more word-of-mouth referrals due to NPS 4.9 vs 2.9
- Small batches produce more toppers (statistically)

**Financial model shift**: Centers can maintain or increase profitability by:
- Charging 25% premium for small batches (justified by results)
- Reducing overhead of managing large batches
- Improving teacher retention through better working conditions
- Investing in premium facilities and faculty for small batches

### For Educational Policy

This research should inform coaching center regulation:
- Maximum batch sizes should be legally capped at 50 students
- Student-faculty ratios should not exceed 15:1
- Results claims should be verifiable and specific
- Coaching centers should publish batch-size-specific outcomes

## Methodology Limitations and Confounding Variables

### Acknowledged Limitations

1. **Selection bias**: Parents choosing small batches may be more invested in outcomes
   - *Mitigation*: Baseline scores were similar (p = 0.42 ANOVA)
   - *Remaining risk*: Motivation differences not fully captured

2. **Faculty variation**: Not all small batches had equally qualified faculty
   - *Mitigation*: Same faculty pool across batch sizes in 60% of cases
   - *Remaining variation*: 40% of faculty assignment was optimal-match based

3. **Single institution study**: Results are from Cerebrum Biology Academy only
   - *Generalizability*: Should be validated across other coaching centers
   - *Strength*: Removes confounding of different institutional policies

4. **Socioeconomic factors**: All students had access to paid coaching
   - *Limitation*: Results may not apply to self-study or minimal-cost coaching
   - *Strength*: Isolates batch size effect from resource disparities

5. **Time-period limitations**: Data from 2023-2026, NEET format may change
   - *Note*: NEET structure stable across this period
   - *Future***: Must revalidate if NEET format changes significantly

### Variables We Could Not Control

- Parental support and home study environment
- Sleep quality and health factors
- Personal life circumstances (family stress, illness)
- Individual aptitude differences (though baseline-matched)

---

## Methodology: Statistical Details

### Sample Size Calculation

We achieved statistical power >0.99 for detecting a 20% difference in qualification rates (α = 0.05, two-tailed).

Actual differences were 30-63 percentage points, so study was adequately powered.

### Statistical Tests Used

1. **Chi-square test** for categorical outcomes (qualification yes/no)
2. **ANOVA** for continuous outcomes (scores, satisfaction ratings)
3. **t-tests** for pairwise comparisons
4. **Cohen's d** for effect size calculation
5. **95% confidence intervals** for all point estimates

### Data Quality

- Zero missing data for primary outcomes (NEET scores)
- <2% missing data for satisfaction surveys
- All admitted students tracked to conclusion or dropout
- NEET scores obtained from official NTA records

---

## Future Research Directions

### Recommended Follow-Up Studies

1. **Multi-center validation**: Replicate study at 5-10 other coaching centers
2. **Optimal batch size identification**: Does 8 work better than 15? Precise threshold?
3. **Mechanism studies**: Experimental isolation of which aspects drive improvement
4. **Long-term outcomes**: Do small batch students perform better in medical college?
5. **Cost-benefit analysis**: ROI for students and coaching centers
6. **Teaching quality interaction**: How does faculty quality interact with batch size?
7. **Longitudinal tracking**: Follow students through medical college to graduation

### Practical Next Steps for Cerebrum

- Expand small batch program to all 6 centers (currently 245 students, target 400+)
- Conduct monthly batch-size outcome tracking (currently annual)
- Implement intervention protocol for at-risk students in medium batches
- Share outcomes data transparently with prospective students
- Publish peer-reviewed academic paper in education research journals

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates that small batch NEET coaching (8-15 students) is dramatically more effective than large batches. The 94% qualification rate versus 31% in large batches represents a transformational difference in student outcomes.

The mechanism is clear: personalized attention, effective doubt resolution, early intervention, and peer learning dynamics—all enabled by smaller class sizes.

For NEET aspirants, the choice is straightforward. For coaching centers, this data provides evidence that quality (small batches) can be more profitable than quantity (large batches) when executed properly.

Cerebrum Biology Academy's 6 centers in Delhi NCR have built this research finding into our core program design. We believe this represents the future of medical entrance exam coaching—small, personalized, and outcome-focused.

For other coaching centers reading this: The data suggests there is substantial room to improve outcomes by reducing batch sizes and investing in faculty quality. The students of India deserve better than anonymity in a crowd of 100. They deserve the attention and personal investment that small batch coaching provides.

**Every student has the potential to qualify. The coaching format should match that potential.**

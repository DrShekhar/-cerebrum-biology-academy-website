---

## üéØ What to Do TODAY

### Step 1: Install MCP SDK (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/drshekhar/cerebrum-biology-academy-website
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

### Step 2: Test the Biology Content Server (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run the MCP server
npx tsx src/lib/mcp/servers/biology-content.ts

# It will wait for stdin/stdout communication
# This is how Claude Desktop connects to it
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop (10 minutes)

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Enable "Developer Mode"
3. Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cerebrum-biology": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/drshekhar/cerebrum-biology-academy-website/node_modules/.bin/tsx",
        "/Users/drshekhar/cerebrum-biology-academy-website/src/lib/mcp/servers/biology-content.ts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. You should see "cerebrum-biology" in available tools

### Step 4: Test with Claude (5 minutes)

Open Claude Desktop and try:

```
Use the cerebrum-biology server to:
1. Query 5 biology questions about Cell Biology
2. Get NCERT Class 11 content on Photosynthesis
3. Show me weak areas for student with ID "STU001"
```

Claude will use your MCP server to answer!

## üéì Next Steps (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Connect Real Database

Replace mock data in `biology-content.ts` with actual Prisma queries:

```typescript
// Before (mock):
const mockQuestions = [...]

// After (real):
const questions = await db.question.findMany({
  where: { topic, difficulty },
  take: limit,
  include: {
    solution: true,
    explanations: true
  }
})
```

### Day 3-4: Add More MCP Servers

Create `src/lib/mcp/servers/student-progress.ts`:

- Track student analytics
- Generate learning recommendations
- Predict NEET scores

Create `src/lib/mcp/servers/whatsapp-integration.ts`:

- Send/receive WhatsApp messages
- Automated student support
- Demo booking confirmations

### Day 5-7: Build AI Tutor

Create `src/app/api/ai/tutor/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { Anthropic } from '@anthropic-ai/sdk'

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { question, studentId } = await req.json()

  const claude = new Anthropic({
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  })

  // Claude uses MCP servers automatically!
  const response = await claude.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
    max_tokens: 2048,
    system: `You are an expert NEET biology tutor. Use the available MCP tools to:
    1. Query relevant biology questions
    2. Get NCERT content
    3. Check student's weak areas
    Provide personalized, accurate explanations.`,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: question,
      },
    ],
  })

  return Response.json(response)
}
```

## üîê Security Checklist

From Anthropic best practices research:

- [ ] Never paste production secrets in prompts
- [ ] Use environment variables for API keys
- [ ] Implement least-privilege for MCP tools
- [ ] Validate all MCP tool inputs
- [ ] Monitor token usage and costs
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Test with mock data first

---

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Claude API Costs (Current Pricing 2025)

**Claude Sonnet 4 (Recommended)**:

- Input: $3 per million tokens
- Output: $15 per million tokens

**For 200 students with 50 questions/day:**

- Daily: ~10M tokens = ~$50
- Monthly: ~$1,500

**Cost Reduction Strategies:**

1. MCP caching (84% reduction) = ~$250/month
2. Extended memory = fewer repeated contexts
3. Smart routing = use cheaper models when appropriate

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: ‚Çπ20K-30K for 200 students
**Revenue per Student**: ‚Çπ3,000/month
**ROI**: 200 √ó ‚Çπ3,000 = ‚Çπ6L revenue vs ‚Çπ30K cost = **20x ROI**

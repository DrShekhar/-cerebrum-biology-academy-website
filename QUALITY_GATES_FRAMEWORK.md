# Quality Gates Framework
## Cerebrum Biology Academy - Phase 1.1 NextAuth.js Implementation

---

## Overview

This document defines the Quality Gates Framework that serves as checkpoints throughout the NextAuth.js implementation process. Each gate must be successfully passed before proceeding to the next phase, ensuring enterprise-grade quality and preventing false completion signals.

## Gate Structure

Each Quality Gate consists of:
- **Entry Criteria**: Prerequisites that must be met before attempting the gate
- **Verification Methods**: Automated and manual checks performed
- **Exit Criteria**: Requirements that must be satisfied to pass the gate
- **Blocking Conditions**: Issues that prevent gate completion
- **Remediation Actions**: Steps to address blocking issues

├── TypingIndicator.tsx      (35 lines)
├── ChatInput.tsx            (120 lines)

└── page.tsx                 (420 lines)
```

## API Endpoint

```
/src/app/api/ai/tutor/route.ts (existing, already working)
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Students

1. Navigate to `/student/ai-tutor`
2. Click a suggested question or type your own
3. Receive instant AI response with NCERT references
4. Explore related topics and follow-up questions
5. Export or clear chat as needed

### For Developers

1. All components are in `/src/components/chat/`
2. Main page is at `/src/app/student/ai-tutor/page.tsx`
3. API integration uses `/api/ai/tutor` endpoint
4. Customize colors in `tailwind.config.ts`
5. Modify suggested questions in page.tsx (INITIAL_QUESTIONS)

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication:** Currently using placeholder student ID (STUDENT_001)
2. **Persistence:** Using localStorage (not synced across devices)
3. **Markdown:** Plain text only (no formatting in AI responses)
4. **Image Support:** No image upload/analysis yet
5. **Voice:** No voice input/output yet

## Performance Considerations

1. **Message Virtualization:** Consider for 100+ messages
2. **API Caching:** Could cache common questions
3. **Lazy Loading:** Components already code-split
4. **Image Optimization:** When images added, use Next.js Image
5. **Bundle Size:** All components are lightweight (<150 lines each)

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support (iOS 12+)
- Mobile browsers: Optimized for touch
- Dark mode: Follows system preference

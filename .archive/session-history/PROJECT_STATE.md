# üéØ CEREBRUM BIOLOGY ACADEMY - COMPLETE PROJECT STATE

> **READ THIS FIRST:** This file contains the complete current state of the project. Always read this file before making any changes or suggestions.

## üìä CURRENT STATUS (Last Updated: Sept 28, 2025)

### **üéØ PROJECT GOAL:**

Deploy Ceri AI (unified AI system) to cerebrumbiologyacademy.com with 3 AI providers:

- Anthropic Claude ‚úÖ (API key configured)
- OpenAI GPT ‚úÖ (API key configured)
- Google AI ‚úÖ (API key configured)

### **üö® CURRENT ISSUE:**

Domain cerebrumbiologyacademy.com shows "ClaudeChat" instead of "Ceri AI" - indicates deployment to wrong Vercel project.

## üîß WHAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED

### **‚úÖ AI System Development:**

- Unified AI client with 3 providers (`/src/lib/ai/unifiedAIClient.ts`)
- Mobile responsive chat interface (`/src/components/chat/IntelligentChatbot.tsx`)
- Error boundaries and graceful failure handling
- Performance monitoring with singleton pattern
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)
- Branding updated to "Ceri AI" throughout codebase

### **‚úÖ Environment Configuration:**

```bash
# .env.local (CONFIGURED WITH REAL KEYS)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-[CONFIGURED]
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-BXLl5n9MMtzlkQszkNOjOSxNZRmSH9XoTlcyiRhMqLEBvcAMC0VcGf69sh[CONFIGURED]
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAfp[CONFIGURED]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cerebrum-biology-academy-website-6d423uz4b.vercel.app
```

### **‚úÖ GitHub Actions Fixed:**

- Disabled 9+ conflicting workflows (.disabled files)
- Created single robust pipeline: `simple-deploy.yml`
- GitHub Secrets configured: VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
- Workflow tests: lint, type-check, build, deploy, verify

### **‚úÖ Deployment Scripts Created:**

- `deploy-fix-forever.sh` - Bulletproof deployment script
- `deploy-manual.sh` - Backup manual deployment
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

## üîç WHAT HAS BEEN TRIED

### **‚ùå Deployment Attempts (All Failed to Fix Domain):**

1. Multiple git commits to trigger auto-deployment
2. Vercel CLI deployment attempts
3. GitHub Actions workflow fixes
4. Domain configuration in Vercel dashboard
5. Environment variable updates
6. Build configuration changes

### **‚ùå Root Cause Identified:**

- Local `.vercel/project.json` has wrong project ID
- Domain points to old deployment instead of Ceri AI version
- Vercel project linking is incorrect

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

**RUN THIS COMMAND TO FIX EVERYTHING:**

```bash
./deploy-fix-forever.sh
```

This script will:

1. Remove wrong Vercel configuration
2. Re-link to correct project with domain
3. Deploy Ceri AI to cerebrumbiologyacademy.com
4. Verify all systems working

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO (AVOID REPEATING)

### **‚ùå DON'T:**

- Suggest creating new AI files (already exist and work)
- Recommend changing environment variables (already configured)
- Create new deployment workflows (simple-deploy.yml works)
- Suggest adding GitHub secrets (already added)
- Recommend domain configuration in Vercel UI (tried multiple times)
- Create new components or modify existing AI code (working locally)

### **‚úÖ DO:**

- Read this file first before any suggestions
- Focus on Vercel project linking issue
- Use the bulletproof deployment script
- Verify the fix worked by checking if domain shows "Ceri AI"

## üì± TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Stack:**

- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router
- TypeScript with strict checking
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vercel for deployment
- Node.js 22 with --legacy-peer-deps

### **Key Files:**

- Main AI client: `/src/lib/ai/unifiedAIClient.ts`
- Chat interface: `/src/components/chat/IntelligentChatbot.tsx`
- API endpoint: `/src/app/api/ai/unified-chat/route.ts`
- Deployment config: `vercel.json`, `.vercel/project.json`

### **URLs:**

- Target domain: https://cerebrumbiologyacademy.com/claudechat
- Working deployment: https://cerebrum-biology-academy-website-6d423uz4b.vercel.app (auth-protected)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/DrShekhar/-cerebrum-biology-academy-website

## üèÅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **When Fixed, You'll See:**

- ‚úÖ cerebrumbiologyacademy.com/claudechat shows "Ceri AI" (not "ClaudeChat")
- ‚úÖ All 3 AI providers work in production
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive interface loads correctly
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions show green checkmarks
- ‚úÖ API endpoint returns 401/405 (exists) not 404 (missing)

## üìû USER CONTEXT

- **User:** Dr. Shekhar (frustrated with repeated deployment issues)
- **Business:** Cerebrum Biology Academy (NEET preparation)
- **Goal:** Production-ready AI tutoring system
- **Priority:** Stop deployment battles, get system live permanently

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE:**
Always read this file before making suggestions. The user is frustrated with repeating solved tasks. Focus ONLY on running the bulletproof deployment script to fix the domain issue.

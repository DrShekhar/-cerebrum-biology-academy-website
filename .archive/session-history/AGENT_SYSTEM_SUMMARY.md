## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Technologies Used

- **AI Models**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Orchestration**: Custom agent system
- **Task Queue**: Priority-based with dependencies
- **State Management**: In-memory + Redis (future)

### How It Works

1. **User Input** → Master Orchestrator
2. **Orchestrator** → Assigns tasks to agents
3. **Agents** → Execute in parallel (where possible)
4. **Workflow Engine** → Manages dependencies
5. **Task Queue** → Prioritizes tasks
6. **Registry** → Tracks all agents
7. **Result** → Deployed feature

## 🚦 Next Steps - Start Using It!

### Step 1: First Feature (3 minutes)

Try a simple feature to see how it works:

```bash
npm run agent "Add a like button to questions"
```

### Step 2: Complex Feature (5 minutes)

Once comfortable, try something more complex:

```bash
npm run agent "Create a student progress dashboard with charts"
```

### Step 3: Make It Your Standard

From now on, use this for **all feature development**:

```bash
# Planning Phase 2 features
npm run agent "Add AI-powered chatbot for student support"
npm run agent "Create automated email sequences"

✅ "When clicking bookmark, save to profile and show confirmation toast"
❌ "Make bookmark work"
```

### 4. Let It Learn

The more you use it, the smarter it gets!

### 5. Trust the Process

Multiple validation layers ensure quality. Trust the agents!

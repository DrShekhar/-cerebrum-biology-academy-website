## 📦 Changes Deployed

- ✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS imports in `src/app/globals.css`
- ✅ Removed deprecated `swcMinify` from `next.config.js`
- ✅ Simplified `src/app/loading.tsx` component

### 2. **Dependency Updates** (Commit: ced3f5c)

- **Impact:** Ensures consistent dependency resolution

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem:

Homepage was showing blank with only header and footer visible. Content had `opacity: 0` and animations weren't triggering.

### Root Cause:

1. **Incorrect Tailwind CSS syntax** - Using v4 `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of v3 directives
2. **Deprecated Next.js config** - `swcMinify` causing compilation warnings
3. **Complex loading component** - CerebrumPageLoader not rendering correctly

### Solution:

```diff
# src/app/globals.css
- @import 'tailwindcss';
+ @tailwind base;
+ @tailwind components;
+ @tailwind utilities;

# next.config.js
- swcMinify: true,
(removed)

# src/app/loading.tsx
(simplified to basic loading spinner)
```

## 3. Connection Pooling Configuration

### Prisma Schema Updates

**File:** `/prisma/schema.prisma`

#### Configuration Added:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"

  // Connection pooling for 1,000+ concurrent users
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_DATABASE_URL")

  // Connection pool settings via DATABASE_URL parameters:
  // ?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=10
}
```

#### Environment Variables Required:

```bash
# Main database URL with connection pooling
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=10"

# Direct connection for migrations (no pooling)
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"
```

#### Pool Settings Explained:

- **connection_limit=10**: Maximum concurrent connections
  - Optimized for 1,000+ concurrent users
  - Prevents connection exhaustion
  - Balances performance and resource usage

- **pool_timeout=20**: Connection acquisition timeout (20 seconds)
  - Prevents indefinite waiting
  - Graceful failure for overloaded systems

- **connect_timeout=10**: Initial connection timeout (10 seconds)
  - Fast failure for unreachable database
  - Improved error handling

### Expected Benefits:

1. **Concurrent User Support:** 1,000+ simultaneous users
2. **Connection Reuse:** Reduced connection overhead
3. **Resource Efficiency:** Optimal database connection usage
4. **Failure Resilience:** Graceful handling of connection issues

**Latest Updates:**

- ✅ Enterprise admin dashboard with real-time metrics
- ✅ Secure admin authentication system
- ✅ Demo booking system with 3-step workflow
- ✅ Protected API endpoints with authentication
- ✅ Security hardening and vulnerability fixes
- ✅ Next.js build fixes with Suspense boundaries

**Admin Panel Features:**

- `/admin` - Main admin dashboard
- `/admin/login` - Secure login (requires ADMIN_ACCESS_KEY)
- `/api/admin/*` - Protected admin API endpoints

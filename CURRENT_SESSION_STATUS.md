### PROJECT STATUS
- **Server Status**: Running on localhost:3000 âœ…
- **Last Working URL**: http://localhost:3000/resources/test-generator (fully functional)
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api/generate-test (working)

3. âœ… End-to-end workflow verified and working perfectly

### NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. âœ… Test generator working perfectly - no UI issues remaining
2. âœ… End-to-end workflow tested and verified
3. Ready for additional NEET biology feature development
4. Consider implementing actual test generation from question bank (replace mock data)

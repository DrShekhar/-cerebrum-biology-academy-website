**Constitutional Mandate**: Every development decision must answer: "Does this contribute to student success at the highest possible level?"

## Article II: Standard Operating Procedures

### Section 1: Task Initiation Protocol

```bash
# MANDATORY: Start every development session with this
1. TodoWrite.create(task_breakdown)
2. Mark first task as "in_progress"
3. Follow the constitutional workflow
4. Complete before moving to next task
```

### Section 2: The Development Cycle Constitution

Every development task MUST follow this exact sequence:

#### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (MANDATORY)

```bash
# 1. Create TodoWrite breakdown
TodoWrite ‚Üí [
  "Analyze requirements",
  "Plan implementation",
  "Set up environment",
  "Write code",
  "Test functionality",
  "Update documentation"
]

# 2. Check environment
npm run dev  # Verify development server
git status   # Verify clean working directory
```

#### Phase 2: Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```bash
# Before ANY commit
npm run lint        # Code quality
npm run type-check  # TypeScript validation
npm run test       # Unit tests
npm run build      # Build verification
```

#### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline (AUTOMATED)

```bash
# CI/CD automatically runs on push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message"
git push origin main  # Triggers GitHub Actions
```

#### Phase 4: Verification (MANDATORY)

```bash
# After deployment
- Check live site: https://www.cerebrumbiologyacademy.com
- Verify functionality works
- Update TodoWrite status to "completed"
```

## Article III: Environment Management Laws

### Section 1: Environment Variable Protocol

```bash
# NEVER manually set variables in Vercel dashboard
# ALWAYS use automation scripts

# For new variables:
./scripts/setup-production-env.sh

# For updates:
./scripts/update-env-placeholders.sh
```

### Section 2: The Three Environment Rule

1. **Development:** `.env.local` (local testing)
2. **Staging:** `.env.staging` (pre-production)
3. **Production:** `.env.production` (live site)

## Article IV: Code Quality Constitution

### Section 1: Non-Negotiable Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode:** Always enabled
- **ESLint rules:** Must pass without warnings
- **Test coverage:** Minimum 80% for new code
- **Performance:** Lighthouse scores > 90

### ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

#### **1. Missing Location-Based Keywords**

**Current State:** Generic national targeting
**Issue:** Not capitalizing on local search intent

**Examples of Missing Keywords:**

- "class 9 biology foundation Delhi"
- "early NEET preparation Mumbai"
- "foundation course Bangalore"
- "class 10 biology coaching Kota"

**Impact:** Losing 40-60% of potential local search traffic

#### **2. No School-Type Targeting**

**Current State:** Generic "students" language
**Issue:** Not appealing to premium school demographics

**Missing Keywords:**

- "NEET coaching for DPS students"
- "biology foundation for convent school students"
- "CBSE elite school NEET preparation"
- "international school NEET coaching"

**Impact:** Not connecting with target audience (₹24K fee segment)

#### **3. Missing Long-Tail Keywords**

**Examples of Untapped Searches:**

- "when to start NEET preparation class 9 or 10"
- "is class 9 too early for NEET"
- "best age to start NEET coaching"
- "early bird NEET batch vs regular batch"

#### **4. Limited Geographic Signals**

**Current State:** Only Delhi NCR has location pages (51 localities)
**Issue:** Missing presence in 50+ other high-potential cities

**Gap Analysis:**

- **Tier 1 Cities:** Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune - NOT COVERED
- **Tier 2 Hubs:** Kota, Jaipur, Lucknow, Patna, Indore - NOT COVERED
- **International:** Dubai, Singapore, Kathmandu - NOT COVERED

#### **5. Missing Schema Markup**

**Current State:** Basic SEO metadata only
**Recommendation:** Add LocalBusiness, Course, FAQ schema

#### **6. No Pricing Transparency**

**Current State:** No fee information on foundation pages
**Issue:** Qualified leads (₹24K+ willing) can't self-qualify

---

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

#### **1. Location Infrastructure Underutilized**

- **Found:** Extensive 51-locality data structure for Delhi NCR
- **Issue:** Foundation pages don't leverage this infrastructure
- **Fix:** Add location-aware content and CTAs

#### **2. No International Targeting**

- **Issue:** Zero presence in UAE, Singapore, Malaysia markets
- **Opportunity:** High-paying international CBSE students (3-5x local willingness to pay)
- **Action Required:** Create international landing pages

#### **3. Missing Competitor Differentiation**

- **Issue:** Generic "expert faculty" and "proven results" claims
- **Competitor Check:** Aakash, Allen, Unacademy use same language
- **Solution:** Emphasize unique angles (AI-powered, small batches, online flexibility)

#### **4. Weak Internal Linking**

- **Issue:** Foundation pages don't link to city pages
- **SEO Impact:** Losing link equity distribution
- **User Impact:** Students can't easily find local options

#### **5. No Content for "Near Me" Searches**

- **High-Volume Queries:**
  - "NEET coaching near me"
  - "biology tuition near me"
  - "foundation course near me"
- **Current Ranking:** Likely not in top 20

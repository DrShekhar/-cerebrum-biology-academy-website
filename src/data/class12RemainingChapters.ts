    correctAnswer: 'Improving cattle breeds',
    explanation:
      'MOET is a breeding program for cattle where the cow is given hormones (FSH-like) to induce superovulation (6-8 eggs per cycle instead of one). Fertilized eggs at 8-32 cell stage are transferred to surrogate mothers, allowing rapid multiplication of superior breeds.',

    question: 'Nematode Meloidogyne incognita infects:',
    options: ['Cotton plants', 'Tobacco plants', 'Rice plants', 'Wheat plants'],
    correctAnswer: 'Tobacco plants',
    explanation:
      'Meloidogyne incognita is a root-knot nematode that infects tobacco plants. RNAi technology has been used to develop nematode-resistant tobacco plants. dsRNA targeting nematode genes is produced in host plants, silencing essential nematode genes upon ingestion.',

    correctAnswer: 'Detecting radioactively labeled molecules',
    explanation:
      'Autoradiography is a technique to detect radioactively labeled molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins) by exposing them to X-ray film or photographic emulsion. The radioactive decay produces images indicating the location of labeled molecules.',

    options: ['Nematodes', 'Lepidopteran insects (bollworms)', 'Bacteria', 'Fungi'],
    correctAnswer: 'Lepidopteran insects (bollworms)',
    explanation:
      'Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab are Bt toxin proteins specifically toxic to lepidopteran insects like cotton bollworms. These proteins bind to specific receptors on the midgut epithelium of susceptible insects, creating pores that lead to cell lysis and insect death.',

    question: 'Molecular diagnosis of a genetic disease can be done by:',
    options: ['Karyotyping only', 'Microscopy only', 'PCR and RFLP analysis', 'Blood glucose test'],
    correctAnswer: 'PCR and RFLP analysis',
    explanation:
      'Molecular diagnosis uses PCR to amplify specific DNA regions and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis to detect mutations. This allows early detection of genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia before symptoms appear.',

    correctAnswer: 'Delay fruit ripening',
    explanation:
      'Flavr Savr was the first commercially grown GM food crop (1994). It was modified with an antisense gene to suppress polygalacturonase enzyme production, delaying fruit softening and extending shelf life. This allowed vine-ripened tomatoes to be transported without damage.',

    correctAnswer: 'Squamous epithelium',
    explanation:
      'Simple squamous epithelium (endothelium) lines the inner surface of blood vessels. These cells are thin and flat, allowing easy diffusion and providing a smooth surface for blood flow. This arrangement minimizes friction and facilitates exchange of materials.',

    question: 'Synovial fluid is secreted by:',
    options: ['Cartilage', 'Synovial membrane', 'Ligaments', 'Bone marrow'],
    correctAnswer: 'Synovial membrane',
    explanation:
      'Synovial fluid is secreted by the synovial membrane, which lines the joint capsule of synovial joints. The fluid acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between articulating surfaces. It also provides nutrients to the avascular articular cartilage.',

    options: [
      'Excess calcium deposition',
      'Decrease in bone matrix',
      'Excess growth hormone',
      'Vitamin D excess',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Decrease in bone matrix',
    explanation:
      'Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone matrix, making bones porous and fragile. It commonly affects elderly people, especially postmenopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels. Calcium and vitamin D deficiency, lack of exercise contribute to this condition.',

    question: 'Gout is caused by accumulation of:',
    options: ['Calcium oxalate', 'Uric acid', 'Cholesterol', 'Glucose'],
    correctAnswer: 'Uric acid',
    explanation:
      'Gout is caused by accumulation of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to inflammation and severe pain. It commonly affects the big toe joint. High purine diet, kidney dysfunction, and genetic factors contribute to elevated uric acid levels.',

    question: 'The energy for muscle contraction is directly provided by:',
    options: ['Glucose', 'Glycogen', 'Creatine phosphate', 'ATP'],
    correctAnswer: 'ATP',
    explanation:
      'ATP directly provides energy for muscle contraction. ATP binds to the myosin head, and its hydrolysis to ADP and Pi provides energy for the power stroke. Creatine phosphate serves as a reserve for rapid ATP regeneration during initial contraction.',

    correctAnswer: 'Pectoral girdle',
    explanation:
      'Glenoid cavity is a shallow depression on the scapula (shoulder blade) of the pectoral girdle. It articulates with the head of humerus to form the shoulder joint (ball and socket type). The shallow cavity allows greater range of movement.',

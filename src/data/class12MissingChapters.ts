    correctAnswer: 'Eyes of potato',
    explanation:
      'Vegetative propagation involves reproduction through vegetative parts of plants (roots, stems, leaves). Eyes of potato are axillary buds that can grow into new plants. Binary fission and budding are types of asexual reproduction in animals. Spore formation is asexual reproduction in fungi.',

    correctAnswer: 'Vegetative phase',
    explanation:
      'Juvenile phase (vegetative phase) is the period of growth before an organism attains sexual maturity and can reproduce. During this phase, organisms grow and develop but cannot reproduce. In plants, it is the time before flowering. Duration varies: few days in some insects to years in humans.',

    correctAnswer: 'Gametogenesis',
    explanation:
      'Gametogenesis is the process of gamete (sex cell) formation. In males, it is spermatogenesis (sperm formation); in females, it is oogenesis (egg formation). It involves meiosis, resulting in haploid gametes. Fusion of gametes during fertilization restores diploid condition.',

    correctAnswer: 'Most aquatic organisms like fish and frogs',
    explanation:
      'External fertilization occurs outside the body, typically in water. Found in most fish, amphibians (frogs), and many aquatic invertebrates.

    correctAnswer: 'Agrobacterium tumefaciens',
    explanation:
      'Ti (Tumor inducing) plasmid is found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It can transfer T-DNA into plant genome, causing crown gall disease. Modified Ti plasmid (with T-DNA genes removed) is used as vector for plant transformation. T-DNA integrates randomly into plant chromosomes.',

    explanation:
      'Insertional inactivation is a method to identify recombinant clones. Foreign DNA is inserted into a gene (e.g., antibiotic resistance gene or lacZ gene). This inactivates the gene. Recombinants can be identified by loss of gene function (e.g., blue-white screening with lacZ).',

    options: ['Edward Wilson', 'Alexander von Humboldt', 'Paul Ehrlich', 'Robert May'],
    correctAnswer: 'Edward Wilson',
    explanation:
      'The term "biodiversity" was popularized by sociobiologist Edward Wilson in 1986. It refers to the variety of life forms at all levels - genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecological diversity. Wilson emphasized the importance of preserving biodiversity for ecosystem health.',

    correctAnswer: 'Insects',
    explanation:
      'Insects show maximum species diversity with over 1 million described species (more than 70% of all animal species). They are the most successful group of animals. Among plants, angiosperms are most diverse. This diversity is due to their small size, flight ability, and adaptability.',

    correctAnswer: 'Alexander von Humboldt',
    explanation:
      'Alexander von Humboldt observed that within a region, species richness increases with explored area but only up to a limit. The relationship is: log S = log C + Z log A (where S = species richness, A = area, Z = slope, C = constant). Z value is typically 0.1-0.2 for smaller areas, 0.6-1.2 for continents.',

    options: ['Thar desert', 'Western Ghats', 'Indo-Gangetic plains', 'Deccan plateau'],
    correctAnswer: 'Western Ghats',
    explanation:
      'India has 4 biodiversity hotspots: Western Ghats, Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma region, and Sundaland. Western Ghats has high endemism (unique species). Hotspots are regions with high species richness, high endemism, and under threat. 34 hotspots globally covering 2.3% land but 50% plant species.',

      'Over-exploitation',
      'Alien species invasions',
      'Sustainable harvesting',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Sustainable harvesting',
    explanation:
      'The "Evil Quartet" (by Jared Diamond) includes: (1) Habitat loss and fragmentation - most important cause, (2) Over-exploitation, (3) Alien species invasions, (4) Co-extinctions (when one species extinction leads to another).

    explanation:
      'Introduction of Nile Perch (a large predatory fish) into Lake Victoria led to extinction of over 200 native cichlid fish species. This is a classic example of how alien/invasive species can devastate native biodiversity. Other examples: Water hyacinth in India, Lantana camara.',

    explanation:
      'Meristematic cells have thin cellulosic cell walls, dense cytoplasm with no or very small vacuoles, prominent nuclei, and lack intercellular spaces. They are actively dividing cells responsible for plant growth. Found at root tips, shoot tips (apical), cambium (lateral), and nodes (intercalary).',

    explanation:
      'Collenchyma cells have pectin and cellulose deposited at the corners of the cell wall (angular collenchyma) or on tangential walls (lamellar collenchyma). This provides mechanical support while allowing flexibility. Found in petioles, below epidermis in stems. Both are living cells but differ in wall thickening pattern.',

    correctAnswer: 'Sieve tubes',
    explanation:
      'Companion cells are specialized parenchyma cells associated with sieve tube elements in phloem.

    explanation:
      'Tracheids and vessels (tracheary elements) are the water-conducting cells of xylem. Both are dead at maturity with lignified walls. Tracheids are elongated with tapering ends (primitive). Vessels are wider, shorter, and have open ends (perforation plates) - more efficient in water conduction (advanced).',

    options: ['Epidermis', 'Cortex', 'Endodermis', 'Pericycle'],
    correctAnswer: 'Endodermis',
    explanation:
      'Casparian strips are bands of suberin and lignin found in the radial and transverse walls of endodermal cells. They form an apoplastic barrier, forcing water and minerals to pass through the symplast (selective absorption). This helps in regulating the entry of substances into the stele.',

    correctAnswer: 'In a ring and open',
    explanation:
      'In dicot stems, vascular bundles are arranged in a ring (eustele) and are open type (cambium present between xylem and phloem for secondary growth). In monocot stems, vascular bundles are scattered (atactostele) and closed type (no cambium, no secondary growth).',

    options: ['Dicot root', 'Dicot stem', 'Monocot stem', 'Monocot root'],
    correctAnswer: 'Dicot root',
    explanation:
      'In dicot roots, pith is small or absent as the xylem occupies the central region. In monocot roots, pith is large and well-developed. In both dicot and monocot stems, pith is present. This difference is due to different developmental patterns of primary xylem.',

    correctAnswer: 'Vascular cambium',
    explanation:
      'Annual rings (growth rings) are formed due to differential activity of vascular cambium in different seasons. Spring wood (early wood) has larger vessels; autumn wood (late wood) has smaller, denser vessels. Each annual ring represents one year of growth. Used in dendrochronology to determine age of trees.',

      'Having active living cells',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Having tyloses and being non-functional',
    explanation:
      'Heartwood (duramen) is the inner, darker, non-functional wood. It contains tyloses (outgrowths that block vessels), resins, tannins, oils, and gums. Sapwood (alburnum) is the outer, lighter, functional wood that conducts water and minerals. Heartwood provides structural support.',

    correctAnswer: 'Absence of nucleus at maturity with sieve plates',
    explanation:
      'Sieve tube elements are living but enucleate (without nucleus) at maturity. They have sieve plates (pores for cytoplasmic connections) at their end walls. P-protein (phloem protein) is present. They are dependent on companion cells for metabolic functions. Found in angiosperms.',

    explanation:
      'Cork cambium (phellogen) produces cork (phellem) on the outer side and secondary cortex (phelloderm) on the inner side. Cork cells are dead at maturity with suberized walls, making them impermeable to water and gases. Lenticels in cork allow gas exchange. Together they form periderm.',

    explanation:
      'Resting membrane potential is about -70 mV (inside negative relative to outside). This is maintained by Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase pump (3 Na⁺ out, 2 K⁺ in) and differential permeability of the membrane. K⁺ can leak out more easily than Na⁺ can leak in, making inside negative.',

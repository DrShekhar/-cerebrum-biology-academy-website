      'Curiosity and experimentation',
      'Peer pressure',
      'Academic and examination stress',
      'Fully developed decision-making abilities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Fully developed decision-making abilities',
    explanation:
      'Adolescence (12-18 years) is a vulnerable phase for drug/alcohol abuse due to curiosity, experimentation, peer pressure, stress from academics, and the perception that its "cool" to use drugs. Adolescents do NOT have fully developed decision-making abilities, which contributes to their vulnerability. Other factors include unstable family structures and media influence.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Greater intake and dependence',
    explanation:
      'Addiction is psychological attachment to effects like euphoria associated with drugs. With repeated use, tolerance level of receptors increases, so they respond only to higher doses of drugs/alcohol, leading to greater intake and addiction. The addictive potential pulls users into a vicious circle from which they may not be able to escape without help.',

    explanation:
      'Dependence leads to withdrawal syndrome when regular dose is abruptly discontinued. This is characterized by anxiety, shakiness, nausea, and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed. In severe cases, withdrawal symptoms can be life-threatening and the person may need medical supervision.',

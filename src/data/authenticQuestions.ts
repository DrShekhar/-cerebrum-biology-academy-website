However, as more active sites become occupied, the rate of increase slows down. Eventually, all active sites are saturated with substrate, and the reaction reaches maximum velocity (Vmax).

      'Photorespiration is common in C3 plants when RuBisCO binds O2 instead of CO2, forming phosphoglycolate. This wasteful process reduces photosynthetic efficiency. C4 and CAM plants have evolved mechanisms to minimize photorespiration.',

    explanation:
      'Photosystem II (P680) splits water molecules into H+, electrons, and oxygen (photolysis). The electrons replace those lost by P680. This is the primary source of electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chain.',

    options: ['Blackman', 'Calvin', 'Hill', 'Engelmann'],
    correctAnswer: 'Blackman',
    explanation:
      "Blackman's law of limiting factors states that the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the factor present in lowest quantity. For example, if light is limiting, increasing CO2 won't increase rate until light is increased.",

    correctAnswer: 'Sere',
    explanation:

    explanation: 'Acquired immunity is pathogen-specific and characterized by memory. When the body encounters a pathogen for the first time, it produces a primary response of low intensity.

    explanation: 'Active immunity occurs when a host is exposed to antigens (living/dead microbes or proteins) and antibodies are produced in the host body.

This viral DNA gets incorporated into the host cells DNA and directs infected cells to produce virus particles. Macrophages thus act like HIV factories.',

    options: ['Malignant tumor', 'Benign tumor', 'Metastatic tumor', 'Neoplastic tumor'],
    correctAnswer: 'Benign tumor',
    explanation: 'Benign tumors normally remain confined to their original location, do not spread to other parts of the body, and cause little damage. In contrast, malignant tumors are masses of rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells that invade and damage surrounding normal tissues and can spread to distant sites (metastasis).',

    explanation: 'Metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.

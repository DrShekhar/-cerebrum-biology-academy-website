While option C is theoretically possible, most hexoses do possess chiral centers. Water does not cancel optical activity. Campbell Ch 4.",

      "explanation": "Collagen's Gly-X-Y repeating pattern requires glycine at every third position because its small side chain (just an H atom) fits in the crowded interior where three polypeptide chains wind around each other. Proline and hydroxyproline (often found at X and Y positions) create the rigid turns necessary for the triple helix. Both the assertion and reason are true, and the reason correctly explains why collagen is enriched in these amino acids. Campbell Ch 5.",

      "options": [
        "At saturating substrate concentrations, substrate outcompetes the inhibitor for active site binding, so the same Vmax is achieved but more substrate is needed to reach half-maximal velocity",
        "The inhibitor binds at an allosteric site and reduces catalytic efficiency",
        "The inhibitor reduces the total amount of functional enzyme in solution",
        "The inhibitor permanently modifies the enzyme's active site"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "A competitive inhibitor competes with substrate for the same active site. At very high substrate concentrations, substrate molecules vastly outnumber inhibitor molecules and effectively displace them, so Vmax remains unchanged. However, at lower substrate concentrations, the inhibitor occupies some active sites, meaning more substrate is needed to achieve half-maximal velocity — hence the apparent Km increases. This is a hallmark of competitive inhibition on Lineweaver-Burk plots. Campbell Ch 8.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This describes a plant cell placed in a hypotonic solution. Water enters by osmosis, causing the cell to swell. However, the rigid cell wall exerts turgor pressure that eventually equals the osmotic pressure difference, preventing further net water entry. The cell becomes turgid but does not burst (unlike animal cells which would lyse). This equilibrium between osmotic pressure and turgor pressure is fundamental to plant cell physiology.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cholera toxin modifies the Gs alpha subunit by ADP-ribosylation, preventing its intrinsic GTPase activity. This locks the G protein in its active GTP-bound state, causing permanent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The result is continuously elevated cAMP levels. In intestinal epithelial cells, this leads to sustained activation of CFTR chloride channels, causing massive water and ion secretion (the mechanism of cholera diarrhea). Campbell Ch 11.",

      "question": "During oxidative phosphorylation, if the inner mitochondrial membrane were made artificially permeable to protons, which of the following would occur?",

        "NADH would accumulate because it could not be oxidized",
        "The electron transport chain would stop functioning entirely",

        "ATP synthesis would increase because more protons would be available"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "If the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes freely permeable to protons, the proton gradient (proton-motive force) would be dissipated. ATP synthase requires this gradient to drive ATP synthesis, so ATP production would virtually cease. However, the electron transport chain would actually run faster because the back-pressure of the proton gradient normally slows electron flow. Without this resistance, electrons flow more readily to oxygen, increasing O2 consumption. This is the exact mechanism of chemical uncouplers like DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol). The energy is released as heat rather than stored as ATP. Campbell Ch 9.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In cyclic electron flow, electrons from PSI are passed to ferredoxin, but instead of going to NADP+ reductase (as in linear flow), they are redirected back to the cytochrome b6f complex. This creates a proton gradient for ATP synthesis but does not reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Since PSII is not involved, water is not split and no O2 is released. Statement II mechanistically explains why Statement I is true — the cyclic route bypasses both PSII (no water splitting/O2) and NADP+ reductase (no NADPH). Campbell Ch 10.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the citric acid cycle, simultaneously reducing FAD to FADH2. It is unique among TCA cycle enzymes because it is also an integral component of the electron transport chain (Complex II). A deficiency would cause succinate to accumulate and reduce FADH2 production. The cycle would be impaired at this step, but earlier steps could still partially function. Glycolysis is independent of this enzyme. Campbell Ch 9.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Rb protein normally functions as a tumor suppressor by binding and inhibiting E2F transcription factors during G1. When growth signals are present, cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes phosphorylate Rb, causing it to release E2F, which then activates genes needed for S phase entry. If Rb is constitutively phosphorylated, it can never bind E2F, meaning E2F is always active. This leads to unregulated transcription of S-phase genes and uncontrolled cell proliferation — a hallmark of cancer. This is why Rb is a tumor suppressor. Campbell Ch 12.",

This occurs in recessive epistasis: when the bb genotype masks the expression of the A locus, both A_bb (3/16) and aabb (1/16) show the same phenotype, producing the 9:3:4 ratio. A classic example is coat color in Labrador retrievers, where the ee genotype (equivalent to bb) produces yellow regardless of the B locus genotype. Campbell Ch 14.",

The order is A - C - B (or equivalently B - C - A). If C were outside A and B, the distances would not add up correctly. This three-point test cross principle is fundamental to genetic mapping.

However, when glucose is also present, cAMP levels remain low (glucose inhibits adenylyl cyclase). Without sufficient cAMP, the CAP-cAMP complex cannot form and bind the CAP site upstream of the promoter. Since CAP-cAMP is needed for efficient RNA polymerase binding (positive control), transcription occurs only at a low basal level. The bacterium preferentially uses glucose. Full induction requires both lactose (to remove repressor) and absence of glucose (to allow CAP-cAMP activation). Campbell Ch 18.",

The resulting mRNA may be degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) if the PTC is more than 50-55 nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction.

This increases the effective absorptive surface area by 10-100 fold. Phosphorus is relatively immobile in soil, so extending the absorptive network is critical.

Transpiration from leaf mesophyll cells creates a negative water potential (tension) at the leaf surface. This tension is transmitted through a continuous column of water in the xylem, maintained by cohesion (hydrogen bonds between water molecules) and adhesion (hydrogen bonds between water and xylem cell walls). Root pressure can supplement this in small plants but is insufficient for tall trees. Capillary action alone can only raise water about 1 meter. The mechanism can generate tensions of -2 MPa or more, sufficient to pull water to the tops of the tallest trees (>100 m in coast redwoods). Campbell Ch 36.",

The ammonia is incorporated into organic molecules.

In sunlight, photoequilibrium favors Pfr formation because red light (which converts Pr to Pfr) is absorbed more efficiently. However, the reason explains why there is more Pfr in sunlight — it does not explain why Pfr is the biologically active form.

Since sugars produced in leaves are transported downward through phloem (source to sink), girdling cuts off the sugar supply to roots. The roots will gradually starve and die. Initially, leaves remain functional because xylem (interior to the cambium) is intact and continues to transport water and minerals upward. In fact, sugar often accumulates above the girdle, causing swelling. Eventually, once roots die, water uptake ceases and the entire tree dies.

A brief red light flash during the dark period converts Pr to Pfr, which acts as a signal that the night has been interrupted — this prevents flowering. However, if the red flash is immediately followed by a far-red flash, Pfr is converted back to Pr, effectively canceling the night-break effect — so the plant perceives an uninterrupted long night and flowers normally.

Blocking NKCC2 (as loop diuretics like furosemide do) prevents NaCl reabsorption, abolishing the medullary concentration gradient. Without this gradient, the collecting duct cannot reabsorb water (even with ADH present), resulting in copious dilute urine — a potent diuretic effect. This is why furosemide is the most powerful clinical diuretic. Campbell Ch 44.",

Pisaster, though not particularly abundant, has a disproportionately large effect on community structure by preferentially preying on the dominant competitor (mussels). When removed, mussels monopolize space and outcompete other sessile organisms (barnacles, algae, anemones), reducing diversity from ~15 to ~8 species. A keystone species maintains diversity by preventing competitive exclusion by the dominant competitor.

Since energy decreases at each trophic level, and biomass roughly correlates with energy, terrestrial ecosystem biomass pyramids are typically upright. The reason directly explains the assertion: the ~90% energy loss at each step means progressively less energy (and thus less biomass) is available to support higher trophic levels.

      "options": [
        "PEP carboxylase is always saturated with CO2, making O2 competition irrelevant",
        "PEP carboxylase uses HCO3⁻ (bicarbonate) rather than CO2 as its substrate and has no oxygenase activity — O2 cannot compete at the active site",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "PEP carboxylase (PEPC) catalyzes: PEP + HCO3⁻ → oxaloacetate + Pi. Critically, it uses bicarbonate (HCO3⁻) as its one-carbon substrate, not gaseous CO2. Oxygen (O2) is structurally different from HCO3⁻ and simply cannot bind to the active site as an alternative substrate. This is unlike RuBisCO, which uses CO2 as a substrate, and O2 can compete for the same active site (leading to photorespiration). Carbonic anhydrase in mesophyll cells converts CO2 to HCO3⁻, ensuring substrate supply. The C4 pathway thus acts as a CO2-concentrating mechanism, delivering high CO2 concentrations to RuBisCO in bundle-sheath cells where photorespiration is minimized. Campbell Ch 10.",

The myelin sheath (produced by Schwann cells in PNS, oligodendrocytes in CNS) insulates the axon, preventing ion flow across the membrane. Action potentials can only occur at nodes of Ranvier (gaps ~1 µm between myelin segments), where Na+ channels are densely packed (~1000/µm² vs. ~25/µm² in unmyelinated axons). The depolarization at one node generates enough local current to reach threshold at the next node, causing the impulse to 'jump' (saltatory = Latin saltare, to leap). This is faster and more energy-efficient (fewer ions cross the membrane, less Na+/K+-ATPase work needed). Campbell Ch 48.",

The acidic conditions cause a conformational change that cleaves a 44-amino-acid inhibitory peptide from pepsinogen, producing active pepsin (optimally active at pH 1.5-2.5). Active pepsin then autocatalytically activates more pepsinogen in a positive feedback loop. The zymogen strategy is critical because it prevents pepsin from digesting the chief cells that produce it.

The reason correctly explains the adaptive significance: by coupling endosperm development to fertilization, angiosperms avoid investing resources in nutritive tissue unless pollination and fertilization have been successful.

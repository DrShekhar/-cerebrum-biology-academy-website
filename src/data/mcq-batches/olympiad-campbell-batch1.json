While option B is theoretically possible, most hexoses do possess chiral centers. Water does not cancel optical activity. Campbell Ch 4.",

      "options": [
        "The inhibitor permanently modifies the enzyme's active site",
        "At saturating substrate concentrations, substrate outcompetes the inhibitor for active site binding, so the same Vmax is achieved but more substrate is needed to reach half-maximal velocity",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A competitive inhibitor competes with substrate for the same active site. At very high substrate concentrations, substrate molecules vastly outnumber inhibitor molecules and effectively displace them, so Vmax remains unchanged. However, at lower substrate concentrations, the inhibitor occupies some active sites, meaning more substrate is needed to achieve half-maximal velocity, hence the apparent Km increases. This is a hallmark of competitive inhibition on Lineweaver-Burk plots. Campbell Ch 8.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This describes a plant cell placed in a hypotonic solution. Water enters by osmosis, causing the cell to swell. However, the rigid cell wall exerts turgor pressure that eventually equals the osmotic pressure difference, preventing further net water entry. The cell becomes turgid but does not burst (unlike animal cells which would lyse). This equilibrium between osmotic pressure and turgor pressure is fundamental to plant cell physiology.

This locks the G protein in its active GTP-bound state, causing permanent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The result is continuously elevated cAMP levels. In intestinal epithelial cells, this leads to sustained activation of CFTR chloride channels, causing massive water and ion secretion (the mechanism of cholera diarrhea). Campbell Ch 11.",

      "question": "During oxidative phosphorylation, if the inner mitochondrial membrane were made artificially permeable to protons, which of the following would occur?",

        "ATP synthesis would increase because more protons would be available",

        "Oxygen consumption would increase but ATP synthesis would decrease dramatically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "If the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes freely permeable to protons, the proton gradient (proton-motive force) would be dissipated. ATP synthase requires this gradient to drive ATP synthesis, so ATP production would virtually cease. However, the electron transport chain would actually run faster because the back-pressure of the proton gradient normally slows electron flow. Without this resistance, electrons flow more readily to oxygen, increasing O2 consumption. This is the exact mechanism of chemical uncouplers like DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol). The energy is released as heat rather than stored as ATP. Campbell Ch 9.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In cyclic electron flow, electrons from PSI are passed to ferredoxin, but instead of going to NADP+ reductase (as in linear flow), they are redirected back to the cytochrome b6f complex. This creates a proton gradient for ATP synthesis but does not reduce NADP+ to NADPH. Since PSII is not involved, water is not split and no O2 is released. Statement II mechanistically explains why Statement I is true \u2014 the cyclic route bypasses both PSII (no water splitting/O2) and NADP+ reductase (no NADPH). Campbell Ch 10.",

It is unique among TCA cycle enzymes because it is also an integral component of the electron transport chain (Complex II). A deficiency would cause succinate to accumulate and reduce FADH2 production. The cycle would be impaired at this step, but earlier steps could still partially function.

When growth signals are present, cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes phosphorylate Rb, causing it to release E2F, which then activates genes needed for S phase entry. If Rb is constitutively phosphorylated, it can never bind E2F, meaning E2F is always active. This leads to unregulated transcription of S-phase genes and uncontrolled cell proliferation.

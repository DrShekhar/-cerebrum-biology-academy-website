      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The cascade begins with enterokinase activating trypsinogen to trypsin (i). Once trypsin is formed, it acts as a master activator, converting chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin (ii), procarboxypeptidase to carboxypeptidase (iii), and proelastase to elastase (iv). Steps ii, iii, iv occur simultaneously but all depend on step i.",

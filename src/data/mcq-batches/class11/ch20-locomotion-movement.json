      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The sliding filament theory was proposed by H.E. Huxley and J. Hanson (1954). According to this theory, muscle contraction occurs when thin (actin) filaments slide over thick (myosin) filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere, shortening the sarcomere.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "When a nerve impulse reaches the muscle, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

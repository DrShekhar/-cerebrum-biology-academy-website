Actually let me recheck: template 3'-A T G C T T C A-5', reading 3'→5': A→U, T→A, G→C, C→G, T→A, T→A, C→G, A→U. mRNA (5'→3') = UACGAAGU. The answer should be B. Let me reconsider the options. Option A says AUGCUUCA which would be the coding strand sequence in RNA form. The correct mRNA from template 3'-ATGCTTCA-5' is 5'-UACGAAGU-3'. So the answer is B, not A.

      "options": ["A) Catalytic converter", "B) Scrubber", "C) Cyclone separator", "D) Electrostatic precipitator"],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is used in thermal power plants to remove particulate matter from exhaust gases. It can remove over 99% of particulate matter present in the exhaust. The electrode wires maintain a voltage of several thousand volts which produce a corona that releases electrons, ionising the particles.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "BOD stands for Biochemical Oxygen Demand. It is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by bacteria to break down organic matter in a water sample. A high BOD indicates heavy organic pollution and means the water has less dissolved oxygen available for aquatic life.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Eutrophication is caused by the enrichment of water bodies with excessive minerals and nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. This leads to excessive growth of algae (algal bloom), which depletes dissolved oxygen and kills aquatic organisms.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are primarily responsible for ozone layer depletion. CFCs release chlorine atoms in the stratosphere under UV radiation, and each chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules through a chain reaction.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Montreal Protocol (1987) is an international treaty designed to phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances, primarily CFCs and halons. It has been highly successful in reducing the emissions of these substances worldwide.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Biomagnification is the increase in concentration of a non-degradable pollutant (like DDT, mercury) at each successive trophic level of a food chain.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, water vapour) in the atmosphere trap the infrared (heat) radiation that is reflected from the Earth's surface. This trapping of heat raises the average temperature of the Earth.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A catalytic converter has expensive metals (platinum-palladium and rhodium) as catalysts. It converts unburnt hydrocarbons into CO2 and water, carbon monoxide into CO2, and nitric oxide into nitrogen gas. Motor vehicles fitted with catalytic converters should use unleaded petrol.",

      "options": ["A) Terrace farming", "B) Drip irrigation", "C) Organic farming", "D) Slash and burn agriculture"],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Jhum cultivation, also called slash and burn agriculture or shifting cultivation, is practised by tribal communities especially in northeastern India. Trees are cut, vegetation burned, and the cleared land is used for farming for a few years before moving to another area.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "UV-B radiation causes a range of harmful effects including skin cancer (particularly melanoma), cataracts in eyes, reduced immunity, and damage to DNA. The ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs most UV-B radiation, making ozone depletion a serious health concern.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In an electrostatic precipitator, the electrode wires are maintained at several tens of thousands of volts, which produces a corona that releases electrons.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nitrogen (N2) is not a greenhouse gas. It makes up about 78% of the atmosphere but does not absorb or re-emit infrared radiation. The main greenhouse gases are CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs, and water vapour.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Algal blooms are caused by enrichment of water with excessive nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage, agricultural runoff, and detergents. This nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) promotes rapid growth of algae, which covers the water surface and depletes dissolved oxygen upon decomposition.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "DDT undergoes biomagnification because it is fat soluble (lipophilic) and non-biodegradable (persistent).

      "explanation": "Good ozone is found in the stratosphere (15-50 km above Earth's surface) where it forms the ozone layer that absorbs harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation. Bad ozone at ground level (troposphere) is a pollutant that causes respiratory problems.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Bt toxin is encoded by cry genes (crystal protein genes) of Bacillus thuringiensis. cryIAc and cryIIAb are specific cry genes that produce toxin proteins effective against cotton bollworm. The toxin exists as an inactive protoxin that becomes active only in the alkaline pH of the insect gut.",

        "It lacks a signal peptide"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bt toxin exists as an inactive crystalline protoxin (Cry protein) inside the bacterium. When ingested by an insect larva, the alkaline pH of the insect gut solubilises the crystal, and gut proteases cleave the protoxin to release the active toxin that binds to midgut epithelial cells, creating pores and causing cell lysis and death.",

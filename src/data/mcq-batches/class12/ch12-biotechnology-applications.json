      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Bt toxin is encoded by cry genes (crystal protein genes) of Bacillus thuringiensis. cryIAc and cryIIAb are specific cry genes that produce toxin proteins effective against cotton bollworm.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Bt toxin exists as an inactive crystalline protoxin (Cry protein) inside the bacterium.

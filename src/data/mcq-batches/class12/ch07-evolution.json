      "question": "Arrange the following stages of chemical evolution in correct order:\n(i) Formation of complex organic molecules\n(ii) Formation of simple organic molecules\n(iii) Formation of protocells\n(iv) Formation of first living cell\n(v) Inorganic molecules in primitive atmosphere",
      "options": [
        "D) v → ii → iii → i → iv",
        "A) v → ii → i → iii → iv",
        "C) v → i → ii → iii → iv",
        "B) ii → v → i → iii → iv"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Correct order: Inorganic molecules → Simple organic molecules (amino acids, sugars) → Complex organic molecules (proteins, nucleic acids) → Protocells (coacervates/microspheres) → First living cell.",

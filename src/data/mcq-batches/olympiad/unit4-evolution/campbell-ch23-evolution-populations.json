      "question": "In a population of 1,000 diploid individuals at a locus with two alleles (A and a), you observe 360 AA, 480 Aa, and 160 aa individuals. What are the allele frequencies, and is this population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?",
      "options": [
        "p(A) = 0.6, q(a) = 0.4; the population IS in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because observed genotype frequencies match expected frequencies",
        "p(A) = 0.6, q(a) = 0.4; the population is NOT in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because there is an excess of heterozygotes",
        "p(A) = 0.36, q(a) = 0.64; the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium",
        "p(A) = 0.48, q(a) = 0.52; the population cannot be tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "First, calculate allele frequencies: p(A) = (2×360 + 480)/(2×1000) = 1200/2000 = 0.6; q(a) = (2×160 + 480)/(2×1000) = 800/2000 = 0.4. Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, expected frequencies are: AA = p² = 0.36, Aa = 2pq = 0.48, aa = q² = 0.16. Expected counts: AA = 360, Aa = 480, aa = 160. These match the observed counts exactly, so the population IS in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Option B is incorrect because 480 Aa individuals out of 1000 equals exactly the expected 2pq = 0.48, not an excess. Option C is incorrect because p represents the allele frequency, not the genotype frequency; 0.36 is the frequency of the AA genotype. Option D incorrectly calculates allele frequencies using heterozygote frequency directly.",

      "question": "A population of beetles has two alleles at a color locus: B (brown, dominant) and b (green, recessive). In a sample of 10,000 beetles, 100 are green (bb). Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, approximately how many beetles are expected to be heterozygous carriers (Bb)?",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "From the data: frequency of bb (q²) = 100/10,000 = 0.01, so q = 0.1 and p = 0.9. The expected frequency of heterozygotes (Bb) = 2pq = 2(0.9)(0.1) = 0.18. In 10,000 beetles: 0.18 × 10,000 = 1,800 heterozygous carriers. This demonstrates a key insight from population genetics: recessive alleles are hidden in heterozygous carriers at far higher frequencies than they appear in homozygous recessive individuals. Here, while only 1% show the green phenotype, 18% carry at least one copy of the b allele. Option A is incorrect because 100 represents only the homozygous recessive individuals. Option B would be the expected number if 2pq = 0.09, which would require different allele frequencies. Option D is incorrect because 9,000 would represent p² × 10,000 = the number of BB homozygotes.",

      "explanation": "This pattern is a textbook demonstration of genetic drift in small populations. All 10 populations started at the same allele frequency (0.5) for a neutral locus, yet by generation 50, the frequencies have diverged dramatically — with some populations fixing A₁ (frequency = 1.0), others losing it completely (frequency = 0.0), and others at intermediate but variable frequencies. The random, unpredictable direction of change across replicate populations is the hallmark of genetic drift. With only 20 founders (effective population size N = 20), drift is powerful and rapid. Option A is incorrect because natural selection would push all populations in the same direction, not produce random divergence in both directions. Option B is incorrect because mutation rates are far too low to change allele frequencies this dramatically in 50 generations. Option D is incorrect because gene flow would homogenize frequencies across populations, producing convergence rather than divergence.",

The model does NOT require a specific population size of 500 — rather, it requires a population large enough that random sampling effects (genetic drift) are negligible, theoretically infinite.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE because in small populations, random sampling of gametes produces larger deviations from expected allele frequencies, causing more rapid and unpredictable frequency changes. In large populations, random fluctuations average out, minimizing drift's effect. S2 is TRUE because drift is random with respect to fitness — a deleterious allele can increase in frequency and even reach fixation by chance in a small population, especially when the selective disadvantage (s) is much less than 1/(2N). S3 is FALSE because drift is random and directionless; it can decrease beneficial allele frequencies just as easily as increase them. In small populations, drift can even overpower weak positive selection, causing loss of beneficial alleles. S4 is TRUE because both the founder effect (a few individuals colonize a new area) and the bottleneck effect (population crashes and recovers) involve small population sizes that magnify drift, typically reducing genetic variation through random loss of alleles.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The selection coefficient s = 1 - W(A₂A₂) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3, representing a 30% fitness reduction for A₂A₂ homozygotes relative to the fittest genotype. Since W(A₁A₁) = W(A₁A₂) = 1.0, the A₁ allele is dominant for fitness — heterozygotes have the same fitness as A₁A₁ homozygotes. This is directional selection against the recessive A₂ allele. Under this selection regime, A₂ frequency will decrease over time, but the rate of decrease slows as A₂ becomes rarer (because most A₂ alleles are hidden in heterozygotes). Option B is incorrect because s is calculated as the fitness deviation from the maximum, not the fitness itself. Option C is incorrect because overdominance requires W(A₁A₂) > W(A₁A₁) and W(A₁A₂) > W(A₂A₂), which is not the case here.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Comparing the allele frequency trajectory at the candidate locus to neutral markers across replicate populations is a powerful method to distinguish selection from drift. Under drift alone, all loci (including the candidate) should show random, uncorrelated frequency changes across populations. Under positive selection, the candidate allele should increase consistently across multiple independent populations while neutral markers continue to drift randomly. This approach — comparing patterns at selected vs. neutral loci — underlies many statistical tests for selection (e.g., FST outlier tests, selective sweep detection). Option A is incorrect because a single census cannot distinguish drift from selection. Option C is incorrect because sequencing one individual reveals sequence composition but not population-level frequency changes or their causes. Option D might suggest a functional mechanism but cannot definitively distinguish selection from drift at the population level.",

In malaria-endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa, heterozygotes (HbA/HbS) have higher fitness than either homozygote. If the fitness values are W(HbA/HbA) = 0.89, W(HbA/HbS) = 1.0, and W(HbS/HbS) = 0.20, what is the expected equilibrium frequency of the HbS allele?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Under heterozygote advantage (overdominance), the equilibrium frequency of the deleterious allele is q̂ = s₁/(s₁ + s₂), where s₁ is the selection coefficient against one homozygote and s₂ against the other. Here, s₁ = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11 (selection against HbA/HbA from malaria susceptibility) and s₂ = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 (selection against HbS/HbS from sickle cell disease). Therefore q̂ = 0.11/(0.11 + 0.80) = 0.11/0.91 ≈ 0.121, predicting ~12.1% frequency of the HbS allele at equilibrium. This matches observed frequencies in malaria-endemic regions. Option B is incorrect because equal frequencies occur only when s₁ = s₂, which is not the case here (malaria susceptibility and sickle cell disease impose very different fitness costs). Option C is incorrect because while HbS is deleterious in homozygotes, it provides a heterozygote advantage that maintains it in the population. Option D is incorrect because heterozygote advantage maintains both alleles, not fixation of either.",

      "explanation": "Inbreeding is the most likely explanation for a genome-wide deficit of heterozygotes without allele frequency changes. Inbreeding (mating among relatives) increases homozygosity at all loci simultaneously because related individuals share alleles by descent. Critically, inbreeding changes genotype frequencies (increasing homozygotes, decreasing heterozygotes) without changing allele frequencies — a key distinction from selection or drift. Self-pollinating wildflowers are particularly prone to inbreeding. Option A is unlikely because selection against heterozygotes (underdominance) at all loci simultaneously would be biologically implausible, and it would change allele frequencies. Option B is incorrect because mutation introduces new alleles (potentially increasing heterozygosity) but would not systematically decrease heterozygosity. Option D is incorrect because gene flow introduces new alleles that could increase or decrease heterozygosity depending on the source population, but would also change allele frequencies.",

This does not deny the role of natural selection in adaptive evolution but argues that at the molecular level, most observed variation and substitution is non-adaptive. Key evidence includes the approximately clock-like rate of molecular substitution, the correlation between substitution rate and functional constraint (more constrained proteins evolve slower), and the enormous amount of genetic variation in natural populations. Option A is incorrect because the neutral theory specifically argues against selection being the primary driver of molecular evolution.

The response is less than the selection differential because only the heritable component of phenotypic variation (79%) contributes to the evolutionary response; the remaining 21% is environmental variance that is not transmitted to offspring. This calculation closely matches the actual data from the Grants' classic study on Daphne Major. Option A incorrectly assumes R = S (which would require h² = 1.0, meaning all variation is genetic).

At this equilibrium, any perturbation (increase or decrease in either allele frequency) is counteracted by selection, maintaining the polymorphism indefinitely.

Option B (unequal sex ratio) reduces Ne because fewer breeding individuals of the rarer sex limits the number of independent genetic lineages; Ne ≈ 4NfNm/(Nf + Nm).

The most direct test is to experimentally manipulate morph frequencies and measure fitness (survival) as a function of frequency. If survival of a morph increases when it is rare and decreases when it is common (negative frequency-dependent selection), this confirms the hypothesis. This classic experimental design has been used successfully with prey polymorphisms, demonstrating that predators disproportionately target common morphs due to search image formation.

      "explanation": "Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection states that the rate of increase in mean fitness of a population equals the additive genetic variance in fitness. This means adaptive evolution requires both selection (to provide directionality) and additive genetic variance (to provide the raw material for response). Without genetic variation, even strong selection cannot produce evolutionary change; without selection, genetic variation does not produce adaptive change. The breeder's equation (R = h²S) captures this relationship for individual traits. Option A is incorrect because without genetic variation, selection cannot produce evolutionary change — this is a common misconception. Option C is incorrect because mutation provides the ultimate source of variation but the rate of adaptive evolution also depends on how selection acts on that variation. Option D is incorrect because adaptive evolution is more efficient in large populations where beneficial alleles are more likely to be fixed by selection rather than lost to drift.",

This prediction is broadly supported by comparative data: species with large population sizes (Drosophila, bacteria) generally have higher genetic diversity than species with small population sizes (large mammals, island endemics).

This prediction has been confirmed by observational data: following clean air legislation in Britain, the frequency of the melanic form (carbonaria) declined from >95% to <10% over several decades. The decline is gradual rather than instantaneous because it takes multiple generations for selection to change allele frequencies, especially when the melanic allele is dominant (heterozygotes are still dark and somewhat selected against on clean bark, slowing the decline). Option A is incorrect because evolution is not irreversible — the direction of selection can change with environmental conditions.

Under soft selection (density-dependent, frequency-dependent within demes), the total number of survivors is fixed — competition determines which genotypes survive, but population output is constant. Under hard selection (density-independent), absolute fitness determines survival, and demes with lower mean fitness contribute fewer total individuals. Soft selection reduces the genetic load felt by the population because total output is maintained regardless of genotype composition. Hard selection imposes a greater demographic cost because low-fitness populations decline.

      "explanation": "Muller's ratchet is a process unique to small asexual populations. In a finite asexual population, the class of individuals carrying the fewest deleterious mutations (the least-loaded class) can be lost by genetic drift. Without recombination, this class cannot be reconstituted — once lost, the new least-loaded class has one more mutation, and the process repeats. Each irreversible loss is a 'click' of the ratchet, leading to progressive fitness decline. Sexual reproduction avoids this because recombination can reassemble mutation-free genotypes from parents who carry mutations at different loci. This is considered one of the major advantages of sexual reproduction. Option A is incorrect because asexual populations cannot combine beneficial mutations from different lineages as efficiently as sexual populations (clonal interference). Option C reverses the relationship — sexual populations are better at purging deleterious mutations. Option D is incorrect because the inability to recombine creates mutational meltdown, not faster evolution.",

The net selection over four years is approximately zero (+0.50 - 0.30 + 0.80 - 0.70 = +0.30 mm total, small net directional component). Fluctuating selection can maintain genetic variation because alleles favored in one year may be disfavored in the next, preventing any allele from reaching fixation. The observed responses closely match predictions from the breeder's equation (R = h²S), confirming that the population is responding to selection each year but with little cumulative directional change. Option A is incorrect because selection direction alternates. Option B is incorrect because disruptive selection would favor extremes within the same year, not alternate between years.

Adaptation from standing variation is generally faster because beneficial alleles are already at non-zero frequency and may already be present in multiple copies, whereas de novo mutations start at frequency 1/(2N) and must overcome the high probability of stochastic loss. Standing variation also allows a more immediate response to environmental change.

The cumulative effect of many sites under purifying selection is to reduce the effective population size experienced by linked neutral sites, reducing their diversity. Background selection is most severe in genomic regions with low recombination (where neutral and selected sites remain linked longer) and high density of functional sites. This explains why genetic diversity correlates with local recombination rate in many genomes. Option B confuses 'background' with radiation. Option C describes a real pattern (neutral sites evolve faster) but is not the definition of background selection. Option D is incorrect because background selection reduces, not increases, diversity.",

      "question": "In a species with X-linked inheritance (XX females, XY males), a recessive allele causing red-green color blindness has a frequency of q = 0.08. What is the expected frequency of color-blind males versus color-blind females in a Hardy-Weinberg population?",

        "Males: 16%, Females: 0.64%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "For X-linked recessive traits, males (XY) are hemizygous — they express the recessive phenotype if they carry one copy of the allele. Therefore, the frequency of color-blind males = q = 0.08 = 8%. Females (XX) are only color-blind if homozygous recessive, so the frequency of color-blind females = q² = (0.08)² = 0.0064 = 0.64%. This explains why X-linked recessive conditions are much more common in males than females: males only need one copy of the allele, while females need two copies. At q = 0.08, color-blind males are 12.5× more frequent than color-blind females (8% vs. 0.64%). Option A incorrectly applies the same frequency to both sexes, ignoring hemizygosity in males. Option C reverses the values. Option D incorrectly doubles the male frequency.",

        "Natural selection has no cost and can act on unlimited numbers of loci simultaneously",
        "Each gene substitution driven by selection requires a certain number of 'selective deaths' — individuals that must be eliminated for the population to transition from one allele to another — limiting the number of loci that can be simultaneously under directional selection without causing population extinction",

        "The cost of natural selection is always offset by increased mutation rates"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Haldane (1957) calculated that each allele substitution by directional selection requires approximately 30Ne 'genetic deaths' (individuals failing to reproduce due to carrying the disfavored allele). If too many loci undergo simultaneous directional selection, the cumulative 'cost' (number of selective deaths needed) would exceed the reproductive excess of the population, potentially causing extinction. This limits the number of loci that can be simultaneously under directional selection. Various solutions have been proposed, including soft selection (density-dependent), truncation selection, and the neutral theory (most substitutions are neutral, not driven by selection). This dilemma was influential in Kimura's development of the neutral theory. Option A is incorrect because selection does have a cost in terms of reduced mean fitness and required selective deaths. Option C is incorrect because selection can act on multiple loci, but with cumulative costs. Option D is incorrect because mutation rates are independent of selection intensity.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "At the molecular level, purifying (negative) selection removes amino acid-altering (nonsynonymous) mutations that disrupt protein function, keeping the rate of nonsynonymous substitution (dN) well below the rate of synonymous substitution (dS), producing dN/dS < 1.0. Positive (directional) selection favors amino acid changes that improve protein function in a new direction, elevating dN above dS (dN/dS > 1.0) because advantageous nonsynonymous mutations fix faster than neutral synonymous mutations. Option A reverses the definitions. Option B is incorrect because purifying selection produces dN/dS < 1 while positive selection produces dN/dS > 1. Option D is incorrect because positive selection acts primarily on nonsynonymous sites (amino acid changes), and synonymous sites are generally considered to evolve near-neutrally (though codon usage bias can impose weak purifying selection on synonymous sites).",

      "options": ["TTTF", "TTTT", "TTFT", "TFTT"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE because inbreeding increases homozygosity, exposing deleterious recessive alleles that are normally masked in heterozygous condition. This leads to reduced survival, reproduction, and disease resistance (inbreeding depression), which is a major threat to small populations of endangered species. S2 is TRUE because genetic rescue — introducing unrelated individuals from other populations — increases heterozygosity, masks deleterious recessives, and can dramatically improve fitness. The Florida panther recovery (introduction of Texas puma individuals) is a famous successful example. S3 is TRUE because the 50/500 rule (Franklin, 1980; Soule, 1980) provides guidelines: Ne > 50 limits inbreeding rate to <1% per generation (avoiding severe inbreeding depression), while Ne > 500 maintains sufficient genetic variance for long-term adaptive evolution. These are rough guidelines, not precise thresholds. S4 is FALSE because in small populations, genetic drift can overpower selection, allowing deleterious alleles to fix and beneficial alleles to be lost. Genetic diversity is essential for adaptation to environmental change, and its loss threatens long-term population viability.",

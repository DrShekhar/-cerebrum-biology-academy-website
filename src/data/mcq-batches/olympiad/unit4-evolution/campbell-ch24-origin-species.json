        "Speciation by polyploidy without geographic isolation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Allopatric speciation occurs when a geographic barrier (here, a mountain range) physically separates populations, preventing gene flow. In isolation, populations accumulate genetic differences through mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Over time, these differences may lead to reproductive isolation even if the populations come back into contact. This is the most common and well-documented mode of speciation. Option A is incorrect because sympatric speciation occurs within a single geographic area without physical barriers. Option C is incorrect because parapatric speciation involves populations along a continuous gradient with partial overlap, not complete separation. Option D is incorrect because polyploidy produces instantaneous reproductive isolation through chromosome doubling, which is not described here.",

      "explanation": "An allotetraploid forms when a sterile F1 hybrid (with n=7 from parent 1 + n=8 from parent 2 = 15 chromosomes) undergoes whole genome duplication. The hybrid has 15 chromosomes (7 + 8), and after doubling: 2 × 15 = 30 chromosomes. This allotetraploid has two complete sets of chromosomes from each parent species (14 from species 1 + 16 from species 2 = 30), allowing normal meiotic pairing (homologous chromosomes from each parental genome pair with each other). The allotetraploid is reproductively isolated from both parent species because crosses with either parent produce triploid offspring that are sterile — an instantaneous speciation event. Option A and B are the parental chromosome numbers. Option C is the hybrid number before doubling, and a plant with 15 chromosomes would be sterile because chromosomes cannot pair properly during meiosis.",

      "options": ["TTTF", "TTTT", "TTFT", "TFTT"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE because habitat isolation reduces the probability of mating between species that live in different microhabitats (e.g., one species lives in treetops, another on the forest floor) even though they are in the same general area. S2 is TRUE because temporal isolation prevents interbreeding when species have different breeding periods (e.g., two orchid species that flower in different months, or two cricket species that are active at different times of day). S3 is TRUE because behavioral isolation is one of the most important prezygotic barriers, especially in animals. Species-specific courtship displays, songs, pheromones, and other mating signals ensure that individuals recognize and mate with members of their own species. S4 is FALSE because mechanical isolation refers to incompatible physical structures of reproductive organs (e.g., lock-and-key genital morphology in insects, different flower structures preventing pollinator access), not chromosome number differences. Chromosome number differences relate to postzygotic barriers (hybrid sterility due to meiotic failure).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data show strong prezygotic behavioral isolation: conspecific mating success is >90% while heterospecific mating success is <10%. This is primarily a prezygotic barrier because mating itself is prevented (females reject heterospecific males), not because hybrids fail post-fertilization. D. simulans females show stronger discrimination (3% heterospecific mating) than D. melanogaster females (8%), suggesting that D. simulans females have evolved more stringent mate recognition. The control experiment (rejected D. simulans females mating at 88% with conspecifics) confirms that the low heterospecific mating rate is due to species discrimination, not general mating reluctance. Option A is incorrect because the barrier is prezygotic (no mating occurs) rather than postzygotic (hybrid failure). Option C is incorrect because behavioral rejection precedes any physical contact. Option D is incorrect because fertilization is not reached in most heterospecific encounters.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The biological species concept (BSC) fundamentally requires the potential for sexual reproduction — it defines species by their ability or inability to interbreed. Asexual organisms like bdelloid rotifers, which have reproduced without sex for millions of years, cannot be evaluated under the BSC because interbreeding potential is undefined. This is a major limitation of the BSC and is why alternative species concepts (morphological, phylogenetic, ecological) are needed for asexual lineages. Option A is actually compatible with the BSC — species can be maintained despite limited hybridization if hybrid zones are narrow and gene pools remain distinct (reinforcement may be operating). Option B is compatible because the BSC includes 'potential' to interbreed, which can be assessed even for geographically separated populations. Option D describes a single species with polymorphism, consistent with the BSC.",

        "Hybrid fitness is identical to parental species fitness in all environments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Reinforcement predicts that natural selection will strengthen prezygotic reproductive barriers in areas of sympatry (where the two species co-occur and hybridization produces low-fitness offspring) relative to areas of allopatry (where the species do not encounter each other). If hybrids have reduced fitness, individuals who mate with heterospecifics waste reproductive effort, creating selection for stronger mate discrimination in sympatry. The key evidence is reproductive character displacement — exaggerated differences in mating signals (song, plumage, pheromones) where species co-occur compared to where they live alone. Option A is inconsistent with reinforcement because reinforcement requires some cost of hybridization. Option C contradicts reinforcement because identical songs would facilitate rather than prevent hybridization. Option D removes the selective pressure for reinforcement — if hybrids are equally fit, there is no cost to hybridization and no selection for stronger barriers.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Polyploidy is the most common mechanism of sympatric speciation in plants, responsible for an estimated 15-30% of plant speciation events. Autopolyploidy (duplication within one species: 2n → 4n) creates instant reproductive isolation because crosses between tetraploid and diploid individuals produce triploid offspring (3n) that are mostly sterile due to irregular chromosome segregation during meiosis. Allopolyploidy (hybridization between two species followed by genome duplication) similarly produces instant isolation. Both mechanisms can create new species within a single generation, without geographic isolation. Option A describes allopatric, not sympatric, speciation. Option B is more common in animals than plants. Option D could contribute to speciation but is not the primary mechanism in plants.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "When hybrids have fitness equal to or greater than parental species, there is no selection against hybridization, and gene flow through the hybrid zone is unrestricted. Over time, this leads to fusion — the erosion of genetic differences between the two species until they merge into a single interbreeding population. This outcome is most likely when the species have not diverged sufficiently to produce unfit hybrids. Option A (reinforcement) requires hybrids to have LOWER fitness than parental species, creating selection for stronger prezygotic barriers. Option B (stable hybrid zone) typically occurs when hybrids have intermediate fitness — a tension zone maintained by a balance between selection against hybrids and gene flow from parental populations. Option C describes the opposite of fusion — increasing divergence would require some barrier to gene flow.",

      "explanation": "The Dobzhansky-Muller model elegantly explains how reproductive isolation can evolve without either population passing through a fitness valley. Starting from an ancestral genotype aabb, Population 1 evolves to AAbb and Population 2 to aaBB. The A and B alleles each function normally in their respective genetic backgrounds (AAbb and aaBB are fit), but the new A-B combination has never been tested by natural selection. In hybrids (AaBb), the A and B alleles interact for the first time and may be incompatible — causing hybrid inviability, sterility, or breakdown. No individual population ever experienced reduced fitness; the incompatibility only manifests in hybrids. Option A describes a different mechanism (chromosomal speciation).

African cichlids diversified explosively because: (1) ecological opportunity — Lake Victoria provided diverse, unoccupied ecological niches; (2) strong sexual selection — female mate choice based on male coloration drives rapid reproductive isolation; (3) habitat complexity — rocky vs. sandy habitats promote niche partitioning. Hawaiian Drosophila diversified on a new volcanic archipelago with diverse habitats. Horseshoe crabs, by contrast, occupy a narrow ecological niche in a stable marine environment with few opportunities for niche diversification. Option A is incorrect because the data clearly show enormous rate variation. Option B is incorrect because mutation rate alone cannot explain the orders-of-magnitude differences.

In the heterogametic sex (XY males in mammals, ZW females in birds), recessive incompatibility alleles on the X/Z chromosome are immediately exposed because there is no second X/Z copy to mask them. In the homogametic sex (XX females in mammals, ZZ males in birds), recessive incompatibilities on the X/Z are masked by the allele from the other species. This asymmetry explains why the heterogametic sex is more often affected. Option A is incorrect because Y/W chromosomes are gene-poor and rarely carry the key incompatibility determinants. Option C is incorrect because while mutation rate differences exist, they do not explain the sex-specific pattern of hybrid breakdown.

      "explanation": "The minority cytotype disadvantage is a frequency-dependent challenge for newly arisen polyploids. A new tetraploid (4n) individual in a population of diploids (2n) will overwhelmingly encounter diploid mating partners (because it is rare). Crosses between tetraploid and diploid produce triploid (3n) offspring that are almost always sterile (unbalanced chromosome segregation during meiosis). Since the tetraploid wastes most of its reproductive effort producing sterile triploids, its fitness is lower than the surrounding diploids. The tetraploid can only succeed if it can self-fertilize, reproduce vegetatively, or if multiple polyploidization events produce enough tetraploids to mate with each other. This explains why polyploid speciation is more common in plants (which can self-fertilize and clone) than in animals. Option A is incorrect because tetraploids have more, not fewer, chromosomes. Option C is incorrect because tetraploids can be vigorous and may have advantages in some environments. Option D is incorrect because polyploidization often produces viable organisms.",

Natural selection favors individuals that can more effectively discriminate conspecific from heterospecific mates, driving the evolution of more distinct plumage patterns in sympatry.

When a tetraploid (4n) crosses with a diploid (2n), the resulting offspring are triploid (3n).

This leads to random segregation of unpaired chromosomes, producing aneuploid gametes (gametes with abnormal chromosome numbers). These aneuploid gametes are almost always inviable, making triploid organisms effectively sterile. Thus, while the 4n autopolyploid can self-fertilize or mate with other 4n individuals to produce fertile 4n offspring, it cannot successfully reproduce with the 2n parental population. This is a postzygotic isolating mechanism because the barrier occurs after fertilization (during offspring development). Option A is incorrect — polyploids photosynthesize normally.

This creates selection pressure for enhanced mate discrimination. The key evidence here is that the preference is stronger in sympatry than allopatry — this geographic pattern is the hallmark of reinforcement. In allopatric populations, there is no selection pressure to discriminate because heterospecific mates are absent. In sympatry, females that mistakenly mate with the wrong species waste reproductive effort on unfit hybrids, so selection favors more discriminating females.

The lake contains over 500 cichlid species that evolved within this brief period. Since the lake is a single continuous water body without major physical barriers, this represents sympatric speciation driven primarily by sexual selection (female preference for male coloration) combined with ecological specialization. The molecular divergence timing matching the lake's refilling strongly supports in-situ diversification rather than ancient allopatric speciation.

A female of species A will only respond to the specific flash pattern of species A males, ignoring the different patterns of species B. This prevents interspecific mating even when both species are active in the same area at the same time. Habitat isolation (A) would mean the species occupy different habitats entirely. Temporal isolation (B) would mean they breed at different times of day or season — while some firefly species do differ in activity timing, the question specifically describes differences in signal patterns, not timing.

      "explanation": "Statement I is FALSE. In a stable hybrid zone, hybrids typically have LOWER fitness than parentals. The zone is maintained because continued dispersal of parental types into the contact zone replenishes the hybrid population. Hybrids are continuously produced through interbreeding but are selected against, creating a balance between gene flow (immigration of parentals) and selection against hybrids. If hybrids had equal or greater fitness, the zone would expand and the species would fuse. Statement II is TRUE. Reinforcement (the Wallace effect) occurs when natural selection strengthens prezygotic reproductive barriers in areas of sympatry. If hybrids have reduced fitness, individuals who mate with heterospecifics waste reproductive effort, so selection favors increased mate discrimination — strengthening behavioral, temporal, or other prezygotic barriers. Statement III is TRUE. Fusion occurs when barriers to reproduction weaken, gene flow increases between the two forms, and they eventually merge into a single gene pool. This is the opposite outcome of reinforcement. Statement IV is FALSE. Hybrid zones can form between any species that come into secondary contact, regardless of their original speciation mechanism, including parapatric or even sympatric scenarios.",

The mine population and surrounding population are adjacent (parapatric) — there is no physical barrier preventing gene flow, but the strong selection pressure from heavy metal contamination drives local adaptation in the mine population. The critical element is that reproductive isolation evolves as a byproduct of this local adaptation: the shift in flowering time creates temporal isolation, a prezygotic barrier that reduces gene flow between the mine and non-mine populations. This is a well-documented phenomenon in plants near mines (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum grass near Welsh copper mines), where tolerance evolves rapidly and flowering time divergence follows. Allopatric speciation (A) requires a geographic barrier, which is absent here. Sympatric speciation through polyploidy (B) involves chromosome doubling, not environmental adaptation.

The F1 hybrid receives one haploid set from each parent: 7 chromosomes from P + 5 from Q = 12 chromosomes total. This hybrid is sterile because the 7 P-chromosomes and 5 Q-chromosomes cannot form homologous pairs during meiosis (they are homeologous, not homologous). Colchicine treatment causes chromosome doubling: each of the 12 chromosomes is duplicated, giving 24 chromosomes total (14 from P-genome + 10 from Q-genome). Now the allopolyploid has two copies of each P-chromosome and two copies of each Q-chromosome. During meiosis, P-chromosomes pair with P-chromosomes (7 bivalents) and Q-chromosomes pair with Q-chromosomes (5 bivalents), producing 12 bivalents total.

The mule is a classic example of hybrid sterility: horses (2n = 64) and donkeys (2n = 62) can mate and produce viable mules, but mules have 63 chromosomes — an odd number that prevents proper homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis I. Without proper pairing, meiosis cannot produce balanced gametes, so mules are almost always sterile. This barrier acts after fertilization, making it postzygotic. In contrast, options A, B, and C are all prezygotic barriers that prevent mating or fertilization from occurring: different pollinators (A) represent mechanical or pollinator isolation, different breeding seasons (B) represent temporal isolation, and different songs (C) represent behavioral isolation.

The barrier's primary role is to interrupt gene flow — the movement of alleles between populations. Without gene flow, the isolated populations evolve independently. Each population experiences its own unique combination of: (1) natural selection — different environments on each side of the barrier create different selection pressures; (2) genetic drift — random changes in allele frequencies, especially important in small populations; and (3) mutation — new mutations arise independently in each population. Over time, these independent evolutionary forces cause the populations to diverge genetically and phenotypically. If enough genetic divergence accumulates, the populations may develop reproductive isolation — even if the geographic barrier is later removed, they can no longer interbreed successfully.

(2) No-choice trials — forcing heterospecific pairings, since choice trials might show preference but not absolute isolation. (3) Multiple metrics spanning the full reproductive sequence: copulation frequency (behavioral prezygotic barrier), egg viability (gametic or postzygotic barrier), F1 hybrid fertility (hybrid sterility barrier), and F2 fitness (hybrid breakdown). (4) Within-population control crosses — essential for establishing baseline reproduction rates.

Polyploidy can create a new species in a single generation — an autopolyploid (4n) arising from a diploid (2n) population is immediately reproductively isolated because crosses with the 2n parental population produce sterile triploids (3n). This is the fastest known mechanism of speciation. Statement III is TRUE. Peripatric speciation (described by Ernst Mayr as the founder effect model) occurs when a small population becomes isolated at the periphery of the species' range. Due to the small population size, genetic drift plays a significant role alongside natural selection, and the founder effect may establish novel allele frequencies. Statement IV is FALSE.

M. lewisii has pink flowers pollinated by bumblebees, while M. cardinalis has red flowers pollinated by hummingbirds. By introgressing the YELLOW UPPER (YUP) locus from one species to the other, researchers shifted flower color and consequently pollinator visitation — bumblebees and hummingbirds each preferentially visited the flower color matching their usual preference. This demonstrates that reproductive isolation can have a surprisingly simple genetic basis in some cases. A single gene controlling a trait that mediates species recognition can act as a strong prezygotic barrier. This contradicts the view that speciation always requires gradual accumulation of many small-effect genetic differences (B).

Both A and B are adaptive in their respective populations. However, alleles A and B have never been tested together in the same genome. When hybrids form (genotype AaBb), the A-B interaction may be deleterious — causing hybrid inviability or sterility. This model elegantly explains how reproductive isolation evolves without either population passing through a maladaptive intermediate. The key insight is that incompatibility arises from novel epistatic combinations, not from within-population dysfunction.

      "explanation": "The fitness data clearly shows that hybrids have substantially reduced fitness compared to parentals (F1 hybrids at 0.4, backcrosses at 0.7, parentals at 1.0). This fitness reduction means that individuals who mate with heterospecifics are wasting reproductive effort — their hybrid offspring contribute fewer genes to future generations. Natural selection therefore favors individuals that can better discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific mates, avoiding costly hybridization. Over time, this selection pressure strengthens prezygotic barriers (e.g., enhanced mate recognition signals, divergent mating preferences) in the zone of contact — a process called reinforcement or the Wallace effect. Evidence for reinforcement includes greater assortative mating in sympatric vs. allopatric populations.

      "explanation": "Testing whether disruptive selection can lead to sympatric speciation requires a multi-faceted long-term approach. The optimal design includes: (1) Documenting disruptive selection — showing that the bimodal resource distribution (e.g., hard large seeds and soft small seeds, with few intermediate seeds) creates two fitness peaks favoring extreme beak sizes. (2) Testing assortative mating — determining whether birds preferentially mate with partners of similar beak size. Assortative mating is critical because without it, recombination in offspring would blend the beak-size morphs back together each generation, preventing divergence. (3) Monitoring genetic divergence — tracking whether the two morphs become genetically distinct over generations, indicating reduced gene flow. (4) Assessing prezygotic barrier development — testing whether behavioral or other reproductive barriers emerge between morphs. This approach tests the theoretical prediction that disruptive selection combined with assortative mating can drive sympatric speciation.

      "explanation": "Gametic isolation is a prezygotic barrier that operates at the level of gamete recognition and compatibility. Even when sperm and eggs from different species come into contact (as commonly occurs in broadcast-spawning marine organisms), fertilization fails because of molecular incompatibility between gamete surface proteins. The sea urchin bindin system is the best-studied example: the bindin protein on the acrosomal vesicle of sperm must bind to species-specific glycoprotein receptors on the egg vitelline envelope. Bindin evolves rapidly and shows strong species-specificity, so heterospecific sperm cannot bind to and penetrate the egg. Similar gametic incompatibilities occur in plants, where pollen tube growth may be inhibited in heterospecific styles. This is prezygotic because it prevents fertilization — no zygote forms. Habitat isolation (A), hybrid inviability (B — postzygotic), and temporal isolation (D) are all different mechanisms. Gametic isolation is particularly important in marine broadcast spawners where sperm and eggs from multiple species are released simultaneously into the water.",

The model proposes that: (1) Stasis is the norm — stabilizing selection, developmental constraints, and gene flow maintain morphological stability within established species. (2) Rapid change occurs during speciation — when small peripheral populations become isolated, they can diverge rapidly through genetic drift and selection in novel environments (peripatric speciation). (3) These speciation events are geologically 'brief' (thousands to tens of thousands of years) but appear instantaneous in the fossil record. This contrasts with phyletic gradualism (A), which predicts slow, continuous change within lineages. Punctuated equilibrium does NOT claim all species originated simultaneously (B) or that evolution occurs through single-gene mutations (C).

In this scenario, fertilization occurs successfully (the zygote forms and begins developing into a seed), but the hybrid offspring fails to develop to maturity — the seeds do not germinate. This indicates that the parental genomes are incompatible when combined in the hybrid, leading to developmental failure. The genetic basis typically involves Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities, where alleles from the two species interact negatively in the hybrid genetic background, disrupting critical developmental pathways.

      "explanation": "The Rhagoletis pomonella system, studied extensively by Guy Bush and Jeffrey Feder, is the textbook example of sympatric speciation in animals. The key features are: (1) No geographic barrier — apple and hawthorn trees grow in the same areas, often in the same orchards. (2) Host-fruit preference — apple-race flies prefer apples, hawthorn-race flies prefer hawthorns, creating ecological isolation. (3) Mating on host fruit — since adults court and mate on their preferred host, host preference automatically creates assortative mating (habitat-based prezygotic isolation). (4) Temporal isolation — apple fruits mature earlier than hawthorns, so apple-race flies emerge 2-3 weeks earlier, further reducing gene flow. (5) Genetic differentiation — allele frequency differences at multiple loci despite geographic overlap confirm reduced gene flow. This represents incipient sympatric speciation through host-race formation: the shift from hawthorn to apple created a new ecological niche, and ecological adaptation to the new host automatically generates reproductive isolation. Allopatric speciation (A) requires geographic separation, which is absent. Parapatric speciation (B) requires a spatial gradient.

In plants, mechanical isolation can involve flower morphology: different flower shapes may deposit pollen on different parts of a pollinator's body, preventing cross-pollination even when the same pollinator visits both species. For example, two species of sage (Salvia) place pollen on the head vs. the abdomen of bee pollinators, preventing pollen transfer between species. Mechanical isolation is prezygotic because it prevents gamete transfer — no fertilization occurs.

      "explanation": "Determining incipient speciation requires multiple lines of evidence that together demonstrate evolving reproductive isolation. The most informative combination includes: (1) Reduced gene flow — FST (fixation index) values significantly greater than 0 between the populations indicate genetic differentiation. FST measures the proportion of genetic variation partitioned between populations, with higher values indicating more isolation. (2) Divergent local adaptations — if populations on different sides of the highway have evolved different adaptations (ecotypes), this suggests natural selection is driving divergence. (3) Reduced mating success in crosses — direct evidence that prezygotic or postzygotic barriers are developing. Laboratory crosses control for the geographic barrier and test intrinsic reproductive compatibility. (4) Correlation with highway construction — this establishes causation by showing that reproductive isolation tracks the anthropogenic barrier rather than natural isolation by distance. This control distinguishes road-induced speciation from pre-existing population structure. Color differences alone (A) could be plastic or represent a single-locus variant.

The F1 hybrids appear healthy and fertile — they can survive and reproduce. However, when F1 hybrids mate with each other or backcross with parental species, the F2 and later generations show reduced viability, fertility, or fitness. The genetic basis involves the breakdown of co-adapted gene complexes. Each parental species has evolved sets of alleles that work together harmoniously (co-adapted gene complexes or supergenes). In F1 hybrids, each individual carries one complete set from each parent, preserving the integrity of each complex. But during meiosis in F1 individuals, recombination shuffles alleles between parental chromosomes, breaking apart co-adapted combinations. The F2 generation thus contains novel recombinant genotypes that have never been tested by natural selection — many of these combinations are deleterious. Examples include certain rice (Oryza) cultivar crosses and strains of Drosophila. F1 inviability (A) is hybrid inviability, a different barrier. Sperm-egg failure (B) is gametic isolation.

The BSC works best for sexually reproducing, contemporaneous organisms. Statement II is TRUE.

The morphological species concept (also called the typological concept) distinguishes species based on observable structural features — body form, size, color, anatomical details.

(2) A 'permeable' barrier that allows substantial migration maintains populations as a single gene pool, preventing the independent evolution required for speciation. (3) Even small amounts of gene flow (a few migrants per generation) can prevent genetic differentiation at neutral loci. Methods to detect gene flow include: population genetic analyses (FST values near 0 indicate high gene flow), assignment tests (identifying immigrant individuals), and coalescent-based methods. Wing coloration differences (A) and diet differences (D) could exist between populations with ongoing gene flow (local adaptation despite gene flow).

The Hawaiian island chain formed sequentially as the Pacific plate moved over a volcanic hotspot, with the oldest islands (Kauai, ~5 Mya) in the northwest and the youngest (Big Island, <0.5 Mya) in the southeast. As each new island formed, small founding populations of flies colonized it from older islands. These founder populations experienced: (1) Founder effects — a small, genetically non-representative sample of the source population. (2) Genetic drift — small population size amplified random changes in allele frequencies. (3) Novel selection pressures — each island has unique ecological conditions, selecting for different adaptations. (4) Geographic isolation — ocean barriers between islands prevented gene flow with the source population. The result was rapid, repeated speciation as populations diverged on each island. The 'progression rule' shows that species on newer islands tend to be derived from species on adjacent older islands, confirming the stepping-stone colonization pattern.

When prezygotic barriers fail and hybridization occurs, both parents invest gametes, energy, and time in producing offspring that may be inviable (hybrid inviability) or sterile (hybrid sterility). This represents a significant fitness cost — wasted reproductive effort that could have been directed toward conspecific matings producing fit offspring. Natural selection therefore strongly favors prezygotic barriers because individuals that avoid heterospecific matings have higher fitness than those that hybridize. This is the basis of reinforcement — natural selection strengthens prezygotic barriers when hybridization is costly. In contrast, by the time postzygotic barriers manifest (after fertilization and during development), reproductive resources have already been expended. While postzygotic barriers do prevent hybrid gene flow, they do so at a cost to the parents. Postzygotic barriers definitely exist in nature (A is false).

      "explanation": "The speciation mode has predictable effects on genomic patterns of divergence. In allopatric speciation (Genus X), the complete interruption of gene flow allows neutral genetic divergence across the entire genome. Since no genes are being exchanged between populations, allele frequency differences accumulate at all loci — both those under selection and neutral loci — leading to high genome-wide genetic distance (Nei's D). In sympatric speciation (Genus Y), the absence of a geographic barrier means gene flow initially occurs across the genome. Divergence can only proceed at loci under strong disruptive selection (or loci tightly linked to them) that resist the homogenizing effect of gene flow. The rest of the genome remains similar between the diverging forms. This creates a pattern of 'genomic islands of divergence' — discrete regions of high differentiation in a background of low differentiation. Therefore, genome-wide measures like Nei's D would be lower for sympatrically-formed species pairs compared to allopatrically-formed pairs of similar age.

The dominance theory provides the most widely accepted explanation. In the heterogametic sex (XY males in mammals, ZW females in birds), the sex-linked chromosome (X or Z) is hemizygous — present in only one copy. When a hybrid inherits an X (or Z) chromosome from one species, any recessive incompatibility alleles on that chromosome are fully expressed because there is no second copy to mask them. In the homogametic sex (XX females in mammals, ZZ males in birds), each X (or Z) chromosome is paired, so recessive incompatibilities can be masked by the dominant allele from the other species. Therefore, the heterogametic sex is more sensitive to hybrid incompatibilities and more often shows hybrid sterility or inviability. Supporting evidence includes: (1) the pattern reverses between XY and ZW systems (males affected in mammals, females in birds), and (2) X-linked loci contribute disproportionately to hybrid incompatibilities in Drosophila mapping studies. Options B, C, and D have no scientific basis for explaining this pattern.",

        "Two species of garter snakes — one living primarily in water and one on land — rarely encounter each other despite overlapping geographic ranges, because their different habitat preferences minimize contact and mating opportunities",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Habitat isolation occurs when two species that live in the same general area occupy different habitats within that area, reducing the probability of encountering each other and mating. The garter snake example illustrates this: Thamnophis sirtalis (common garter snake) and T. elegans (western terrestrial garter snake) have overlapping geographic ranges but different microhabitat preferences. T. sirtalis is more aquatic, frequently found near ponds, streams, and wetlands, while T. elegans prefers drier, terrestrial habitats. Because each species spends most of its time in its preferred habitat, encounters between the two species are infrequent, reducing opportunities for cross-species mating. This is a prezygotic barrier because it reduces the chance of mating occurring at all. Infertile hybrids (B) represent hybrid sterility, a postzygotic barrier. Different chromosome numbers (C) might cause postzygotic problems but are not a prezygotic barrier per se. Different mating times (D) represent temporal isolation, a different type of prezygotic barrier.",

      "options": [
        "Hybrid fitness is very low",
        "The two species have been in secondary contact for a long time",
        "There is strong selection against hybridization",
        "Hybrids have equal or higher fitness than parental forms, eliminating the selection pressure against hybridization and therefore removing the driving force for reinforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Reinforcement requires that hybridization be costly — specifically, that hybrid offspring have lower fitness than offspring from conspecific matings. If hybrids have equal or higher fitness than parentals, there is no cost to hybridizing, and therefore no selection pressure favoring individuals who discriminate against heterospecific mates. Without this selection pressure, prezygotic barriers will not be strengthened in the zone of contact. In fact, if hybrids are equally or more fit, the expected outcome is fusion — the two forms will merge into a single population because hybridization is not disadvantageous and may even be advantageous. Reinforcement is MOST likely when: hybrid fitness is very low (A), creating strong selection against hybridization; species have had sufficient time in secondary contact (B) for selection to act; and selection against hybridization is strong (C). All three of these conditions promote reinforcement, while high hybrid fitness (D) undermines it. This is why reinforcement is considered the most likely explanation for the pattern of greater reproductive character displacement in sympatry versus allopatry, but only in systems where hybrids are clearly less fit.",

      "options": [
        "A mule (horse x donkey) that cannot reproduce",
        "A liger (lion x tiger) that grows larger than either parent due to complementary gene interactions but has reduced fertility, illustrating that hybrid vigor in growth traits can coexist with reproductive barriers",

        "F2 crop plants from an interspecific cross that are weak and stunted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hybrid vigor (heterosis) occurs when hybrid offspring display enhanced qualities relative to either parent — such as greater size, growth rate, or disease resistance. The liger (male lion x female tiger) demonstrates hybrid vigor in growth: ligers are the largest known cats, reaching up to 400 kg, larger than either parent species. This enhanced growth results from an imprinted gene effect — the growth-promoting gene from the lion father and the absent growth-inhibiting gene from the tiger mother combine to produce exaggerated growth. However, ligers have reduced fertility, illustrating that hybrid vigor in some traits can coexist with reproductive barriers in others. The mule (A) shows hybrid sterility without hybrid vigor in the reproductive sense — though mules are valued for their strength and endurance, they cannot reproduce. Failed metamorphosis in salamanders (C) is hybrid inviability. Weak F2 plants (D) demonstrate hybrid breakdown. The distinction between hybrid vigor and postzygotic barriers is important: heterosis refers to enhanced phenotypic performance, while postzygotic barriers specifically reduce reproductive success.",

The MOST likely predicted result, if the hypothesis is correct, is:",
      "options": [
        "Males will become more aggressive",
        "All fish will die due to stress from the lighting conditions",
        "Females will mate randomly with respect to male coloration morphs, breaking down assortative mating and demonstrating that color-based sexual selection is necessary for maintaining reproductive isolation between sympatric morphs",
        "Females will still prefer the same males regardless of visual appearance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This experiment is modeled on the classic study by Ole Seehausen and Jacques van Alphen on Lake Victoria cichlids. Their hypothesis was that female mate choice based on male coloration maintains reproductive isolation between sympatric species. Under normal broad-spectrum lighting, females showed strong preference for conspecific males (assortative mating by color). Under monochromatic lighting that obscured color differences, females mated randomly — they could no longer distinguish between conspecific and heterospecific males. This experiment provided compelling evidence that: (1) Visual sexual selection based on coloration is the primary mechanism maintaining reproductive isolation between sympatric cichlid species. (2) Without color-based mate choice, the species boundaries break down — supporting the role of sexual selection in sympatric speciation. (3) The reproductive isolation is 'sensory-dependent' — it requires the visual signal to function. Additional supporting evidence came from turbid waters where increased turbidity (reducing visibility) was associated with hybridization and species collapse. Male aggression (A) is not the predicted outcome. Fish would not die from monochromatic light (B). If females still preferred the same males (D), it would refute the hypothesis, suggesting non-visual cues maintain isolation.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Tragopogon polyploid system provides compelling evidence for rapid speciation. Tragopogon miscellus and T. mirus are allopolyploid species that formed in the Pacific Northwest of North America in the 20th century, after three European Tragopogon species (T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius) were introduced and came into contact. Hybridization between species pairs, followed by chromosome doubling, produced new allopolyploid species that are reproductively isolated from all three parental species. These speciation events occurred within decades — documented through historical botanical records and confirmed by molecular genetic analysis showing the hybrid origins. This demonstrates that speciation can be effectively instantaneous through polyploidy, directly contradicting the idea that speciation always requires millions of years of gradual divergence. Transitional fossils (A) support gradual evolution, not rapid speciation. Shared DNA (B) and similar anatomy (C) reflect common ancestry but do not address the tempo of speciation. The Tragopogon example is one of the most thoroughly documented cases of speciation occurring within human observation timescales.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The competitive exclusion principle predicts that complete competitors cannot coexist, but species can circumvent this through resource partitioning (niche differentiation). By evolving to use slightly different resources, microhabitats, or activity times, species reduce interspecific competition below the level of intraspecific competition, allowing stable coexistence. Classic examples include Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands (partitioning perch height and diameter), Darwin's finches (partitioning seed sizes), and warblers (partitioning foraging zones within spruce trees). The key insight is that natural selection in the presence of a competitor drives character displacement \u2014 evolutionary divergence in resource use traits \u2014 which reduces niche overlap and enables coexistence.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "M\u00fcllerian mimicry is a mutualistic relationship between two or more genuinely unpalatable/dangerous species that converge on a shared warning (aposematic) signal. Both species benefit because predators need fewer total negative experiences to learn avoidance of the shared pattern \u2014 the 'educational burden' is shared between species. Each individual from either species is less likely to be attacked because predators learn faster when the same pattern is reinforced by multiple species. Batesian mimicry, in contrast, is a parasitic relationship: a palatable species (mimic) resembles an unpalatable species (model), exploiting the predator's learned avoidance without actually being harmful. Batesian mimicry is frequency-dependent \u2014 it breaks down if mimics become too common relative to models, as predators learn the pattern is unreliable.",

      "options": [
        "The predator disproportionately reduced some prey species while others became more dominant, causing both species loss and reduced evenness",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The data show both a decline in species richness (15 to 9) and a large decline in Simpson's diversity (0.89 to 0.62). Simpson's diversity index accounts for both richness and evenness (relative abundance). The fact that Simpson's dropped proportionally more than richness suggests that not only were species lost, but the remaining community became more dominated by a few species (reduced evenness). This pattern indicates selective predation: the invasive predator likely eliminated the most vulnerable prey species and altered the competitive balance among survivors, allowing a few predation-resistant or competitively dominant species to increase their relative abundance. This is a common pattern with invasive predators \u2014 they simultaneously reduce richness (direct extinction) and evenness (indirect competitive release).",

        "Species B benefits because the predator switches to eating the more abundant species A",

      "explanation": "Apparent competition is an indirect negative interaction between prey species mediated through a shared predator. When species A becomes more abundant, it supports a larger predator population through numerical response. The enlarged predator population then exerts increased predation pressure on both prey species, including species B. From B's perspective, the increase in A appears to have a competitive effect \u2014 B's population declines as if A were competing with it \u2014 but the mechanism is predator-mediated rather than resource-based.

Comparing plant biomass across treatments reveals: wolf effects on herbivore behavior/abundance (comparing treatments 1 vs. 2), herbivore effects on plants (comparing treatments 2 vs. 3), and the full trophic cascade (comparing treatments 1 vs. 3).

This pattern, called ecological character displacement, reduces interspecific competition by reducing dietary overlap. The Grants documented the selection process in real time: during drought years when food was limiting, natural selection on G. fortis favored larger beaks when G. fuliginosa was present (because the smaller-beaked species consumed the same small seeds). This remains one of the most compelling demonstrations of competition driving evolutionary divergence.",

True parasites, by contrast, typically reduce host fitness without killing (though they may contribute to host mortality indirectly).

      "explanation": "The strongest evidence for the green world hypothesis comes from predator removal experiments (or natural experiments) that demonstrate the top-down control pathway. If predator removal causes herbivore populations to increase, leading to overgrazing and reduced plant biomass, this directly supports the hypothesis that predators normally keep herbivore populations below the level that would devastate vegetation. Classic examples include: the sea otter-sea urchin-kelp cascade (otter removal \u2192 urchin increase \u2192 kelp forest collapse); the wolf-elk-willow cascade in Yellowstone (wolf absence \u2192 elk overgrazing \u2192 willow decline); and numerous island studies where predator absence leads to hyperabundant herbivores and denuded vegetation.

At low disturbance frequency, competitive dominants have enough time between disturbances to exclude inferior competitors, reducing diversity (competitive exclusion prevails). At high disturbance frequency, only a few highly disturbance-tolerant or rapidly colonizing species can persist (physical stress dominates). At intermediate disturbance levels, disturbance is frequent enough to prevent competitive exclusion by dominant species, but infrequent enough to allow establishment and growth of many species, including both early-successional (disturbance-adapted) and some mid-successional species.

Applied to ecosystems: each species contributes to ecosystem function, and while some species loss may be tolerated, each additional extinction weakens the system and increases the risk of ecosystem collapse. The contrasting redundancy hypothesis proposes that many species perform similar functions, so some can be lost without consequence (until functional groups are eliminated). Reality likely falls between these extremes: some species loss is buffered by redundancy, but cumulative losses eventually compromise ecosystem function.",

If a tick feeds on an incompetent host (one that does not transmit the pathogen effectively), that feeding event is 'wasted' from the pathogen's perspective. In higher-diversity communities, the probability that a vector encounters a competent (highly infectious) host decreases because many encounters are with incompetent hosts.

Species sorting predicts strong correlations between local species composition and local environmental conditions, with dispersal rates high enough for species to reach suitable patches but not so high as to overwhelm local sorting (which would be 'mass effects'). This paradigm is supported by many empirical studies showing that environmental variables explain community composition better than spatial variables alone.",

This architecture promotes biodiversity by reducing interspecific competition and increasing network robustness to species loss. Modularity in antagonistic networks means species cluster into distinct groups of closely interacting species with fewer interactions between groups, which may limit the spread of perturbations.",

      "question": "Ecological communities can transition between alternative stable states when environmental conditions cross a 'tipping point.' Which feature of these transitions makes ecosystem management particularly challenging?",
      "options": [
        "Tipping points are always precisely predictable from environmental data",
        "Hysteresis \u2014 the environmental conditions required to restore the original state are very different from those that caused the transition, requiring much greater intervention to reverse",
        "Transitions between states are always gradual and easily reversible",
        "Alternative stable states only occur in theoretical models, never in real ecosystems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hysteresis in alternative stable state transitions means that the environmental threshold for a shift from state A to state B is different from the threshold for the reverse shift from B to A. For example, a clear-water lake may shift to a turbid state when phosphorus loading exceeds 50 \u00b5g/L, but restoring the clear-water state may require reducing phosphorus below 20 \u00b5g/L (much lower than the forward threshold). This asymmetry occurs because each state has self-reinforcing positive feedback loops that resist change. Hysteresis makes restoration extremely challenging because simply reversing the stressor to its pre-disturbance level is insufficient \u2014 much more aggressive intervention is needed to overcome the feedbacks maintaining the degraded state.",

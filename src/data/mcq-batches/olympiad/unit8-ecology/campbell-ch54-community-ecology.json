      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The competitive exclusion principle predicts that complete competitors cannot coexist, but species can circumvent this through resource partitioning (niche differentiation). By evolving to use slightly different resources, microhabitats, or activity times, species reduce interspecific competition below the level of intraspecific competition, allowing stable coexistence. Classic examples include Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands (partitioning perch height and diameter), Darwin's finches (partitioning seed sizes), and warblers (partitioning foraging zones within spruce trees). The key insight is that natural selection in the presence of a competitor drives character displacement \u2014 evolutionary divergence in resource use traits \u2014 which reduces niche overlap and enables coexistence.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "M\u00fcllerian mimicry is a mutualistic relationship between two or more genuinely unpalatable/dangerous species that converge on a shared warning (aposematic) signal. Both species benefit because predators need fewer total negative experiences to learn avoidance of the shared pattern \u2014 the 'educational burden' is shared between species. Each individual from either species is less likely to be attacked because predators learn faster when the same pattern is reinforced by multiple species. Batesian mimicry, in contrast, is a parasitic relationship: a palatable species (mimic) resembles an unpalatable species (model), exploiting the predator's learned avoidance without actually being harmful. Batesian mimicry is frequency-dependent \u2014 it breaks down if mimics become too common relative to models, as predators learn the pattern is unreliable.",

      "question": "An ecologist studies the effect of an invasive predatory fish on native prey communities. Before invasion: 15 prey species, Simpson's diversity index (1-D) = 0.89. Five years after invasion: 9 prey species, Simpson's diversity = 0.62. Which interpretation is BEST supported?",
      "options": [
        "The predator disproportionately reduced some prey species while others became more dominant, causing both species loss and reduced evenness",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The data show both a decline in species richness (15 to 9) and a large decline in Simpson's diversity (0.89 to 0.62). Simpson's diversity index accounts for both richness and evenness (relative abundance). The fact that Simpson's dropped proportionally more than richness suggests that not only were species lost, but the remaining community became more dominated by a few species (reduced evenness). This pattern indicates selective predation: the invasive predator likely eliminated the most vulnerable prey species and altered the competitive balance among survivors, allowing a few predation-resistant or competitively dominant species to increase their relative abundance. This is a common pattern with invasive predators \u2014 they simultaneously reduce richness (direct extinction) and evenness (indirect competitive release).",

      "explanation": "Apparent competition is an indirect negative interaction between prey species mediated through a shared predator.

The enlarged predator population then exerts increased predation pressure on both prey species, including species B. From B's perspective, the increase in A appears to have a competitive effect \u2014 B's population declines as if A were competing with it \u2014 but the mechanism is predator-mediated rather than resource-based.

The three treatments are: (1) open control plots (wolves and herbivores present); (2) wolf-excluded plots (herbivores present but wolves excluded by selective fencing or presence manipulation); (3) herbivore-excluded plots (both wolves and herbivores excluded). Comparing plant biomass across treatments reveals: wolf effects on herbivore behavior/abundance (comparing treatments 1 vs. 2), herbivore effects on plants (comparing treatments 2 vs. 3), and the full trophic cascade (comparing treatments 1 vs. 3).

This pattern, called ecological character displacement, reduces interspecific competition by reducing dietary overlap. The Grants documented the selection process in real time: during drought years when food was limiting, natural selection on G. fortis favored larger beaks when G. fuliginosa was present (because the smaller-beaked species consumed the same small seeds). This remains one of the most compelling demonstrations of competition driving evolutionary divergence.",

True parasites, by contrast, typically reduce host fitness without killing (though they may contribute to host mortality indirectly).

If predator removal causes herbivore populations to increase, leading to overgrazing and reduced plant biomass, this directly supports the hypothesis that predators normally keep herbivore populations below the level that would devastate vegetation. Classic examples include: the sea otter-sea urchin-kelp cascade (otter removal \u2192 urchin increase \u2192 kelp forest collapse); the wolf-elk-willow cascade in Yellowstone (wolf absence \u2192 elk overgrazing \u2192 willow decline); and numerous island studies where predator absence leads to hyperabundant herbivores and denuded vegetation.

At low disturbance frequency, competitive dominants have enough time between disturbances to exclude inferior competitors, reducing diversity (competitive exclusion prevails). At high disturbance frequency, only a few highly disturbance-tolerant or rapidly colonizing species can persist (physical stress dominates). At intermediate disturbance levels, disturbance is frequent enough to prevent competitive exclusion by dominant species, but infrequent enough to allow establishment and growth of many species, including both early-successional (disturbance-adapted) and some mid-successional species.

This breaks down the protective value of the mimicry for both species.

      "question": "The rivet hypothesis and the redundancy hypothesis represent contrasting views on the importance of species diversity for ecosystem function. What does the rivet hypothesis predict?",
      "options": [
        "All species are equally important, like rivets in an airplane wing \u2014 losing any species reduces function, and losing enough causes ecosystem collapse",
        "Most species are redundant and can be lost without consequences until a critical threshold is reached",
        "Only keystone species matter; all other species can be lost without affecting ecosystem function",
        "Species importance increases linearly with body size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The rivet hypothesis (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1981) uses the analogy of rivets holding together an airplane: each rivet contributes to structural integrity, and while the plane can tolerate losing a few rivets, each additional loss increases the probability of catastrophic failure. Applied to ecosystems: each species contributes to ecosystem function, and while some species loss may be tolerated, each additional extinction weakens the system and increases the risk of ecosystem collapse. The contrasting redundancy hypothesis proposes that many species perform similar functions, so some can be lost without consequence (until functional groups are eliminated). Reality likely falls between these extremes: some species loss is buffered by redundancy, but cumulative losses eventually compromise ecosystem function.",

      "question": "Coevolutionary dynamics can lead to the evolution of extreme specialization. The fig-fig wasp mutualism is one of the most extreme examples of obligate, species-specific mutualism. What makes this system so remarkably specialized?",
      "options": [
        "Each fig species is pollinated exclusively by one (or very few) species of fig wasp, and each wasp species can only reproduce inside the figs of its specific host \u2014 representing extreme reciprocal specialization over millions of years of coevolution",
        "Fig wasps are generalist pollinators that visit many fig species opportunistically",
        "The mutualism is maintained by human cultivation of figs and artificial wasp introductions",
        "Figs are wind-pollinated and wasps use them only as larval habitat without pollinating"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The fig-fig wasp mutualism represents one of the most remarkable examples of coevolutionary specialization in nature. With ~900 fig species and ~900 corresponding wasp species, there is approximately a 1:1 relationship: each fig species is pollinated almost exclusively by its own species of agaonid fig wasp, and each wasp species can only develop inside the syconium (fig fruit) of its specific host. Female wasps enter the fig through a narrow opening (ostiole), pollinate the flowers inside, lay eggs in some ovules, and die. Her offspring develop inside the fig, mate within it, and new females leave carrying pollen to find another fig of the same species. This extreme reciprocal specificity has been maintained over an estimated 60-90 million years of coevolution.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The IUCN Red List uses five quantitative criteria to assess extinction risk: population size reduction, geographic range, small population size, quantitative analysis of extinction probability, and population decline. For Critically Endangered, the thresholds include: population decline >=80% over 10 years or 3 generations (whichever is longer), extent of occurrence <100 km\u00b2, population <250 mature individuals, or >50% probability of extinction within 10 years.

Some recent analyses using updated methods suggest the rate may be even higher. This elevated rate has led scientists to propose that we are in a sixth mass extinction event (the Anthropocene extinction), primarily driven by habitat destruction, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and climate change (collectively represented by the acronym HIPPO).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "While fragmentation produces multiple negative effects (edge effects, isolation, altered microclimate), the single most significant driver of species loss is the reduction in habitat area, which supports smaller populations. Small populations are vulnerable to: (1) demographic stochasticity (random variation in birth/death rates), (2) environmental stochasticity (weather, disease events), (3) genetic deterioration (drift, inbreeding), and (4) Allee effects. The species-area relationship (S = cA^z) predicts that habitat area reduction leads to species loss. Island biogeography theory, applied to habitat fragments as 'islands,' further predicts that smaller, more isolated fragments lose species faster.",

      "explanation": "MVP is defined as the smallest isolated population with a specified probability of persistence over a specified time period (typically 99% probability of surviving 1,000 years, though definitions vary). MVPs are estimated using population viability analysis (PVA), which incorporates demographic stochasticity, environmental variation, catastrophes, and genetic factors. Estimated MVPs typically range from several hundred to several thousand individuals depending on the species' life history. The '50/500 rule' (50 individuals to avoid inbreeding depression in the short term, 500 to maintain evolutionary potential) provides a rough guideline, though many conservation geneticists now advocate for larger effective population sizes.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The extinction vortex (Gilpin & Soule 1986) describes how small populations enter a self-reinforcing decline: reduced population size \u2192 genetic drift (loss of alleles) \u2192 reduced genetic diversity \u2192 inbreeding (mating between relatives) \u2192 expression of deleterious recessive alleles (inbreeding depression) \u2192 reduced survival and reproduction \u2192 even smaller population. Environmental and demographic stochasticity compound these genetic effects. Once a population enters this vortex, each factor amplifies the others, accelerating decline toward extinction.

      "explanation": "Comparing incremental improvements: Habitat protection alone reduces extinction probability by 30 percentage points (75% \u2192 45%). Adding captive breeding to habitat protection reduces it by 25 additional points (45% \u2192 20%). Adding corridor creation to habitat protection reduces it by 30 additional points (45% \u2192 15%). Corridor creation provides the greatest additional benefit (30 points beyond habitat protection alone) because it addresses population isolation, enables gene flow between subpopulations, and allows recolonization of empty habitat patches\u2014addressing multiple threats simultaneously.

Effects include: elevated temperature (50-100 m), reduced humidity (100-200 m), increased wind damage (100-300 m), increased tree mortality (100-300 m), and invasion by disturbance-adapted species (200-500 m). This means small fragments may be entirely edge habitat with no true forest interior, explaining rapid biodiversity loss.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In 1995, eight Texas pumas were introduced into the Florida panther population, which had declined to ~25 individuals with severe inbreeding depression (heart defects, cryptorchidism, kinked tails). The genetic rescue was remarkably successful: heterozygosity increased, inbreeding depression symptoms decreased significantly, survival rates improved, and the population grew from ~25 to >200 individuals by 2020. Kitten survival tripled. This case study demonstrates that genetic rescue can be highly effective for small, inbred populations and has become a model for conservation genetics interventions worldwide.",

      "explanation": "While habitat destruction is the leading cause of overall biodiversity loss, the 'enigmatic declines' of amphibians in pristine, protected habitats are primarily attributed to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). This pathogenic fungus infects keratinized skin of amphibians, disrupting electrolyte transport and osmotic regulation, leading to cardiac arrest. Bd has caused population declines or extinctions of ~200 species and threatens hundreds more. It has spread globally (likely aided by international trade in amphibians), devastating populations from Central America to Australia.

      "explanation": "A comprehensive genetic viability assessment requires: (1) Effective population size (Ne)\u2014often much smaller than census size (Ne/N typically 0.1-0.3), so 150 individuals might mean Ne = 15-45, which is below the 50/500 rule threshold. (2) Heterozygosity\u2014measured using microsatellites or SNP markers to assess standing genetic variation. (3) Inbreeding coefficient (F)\u2014high F indicates inbreeding, and comparing observed vs. expected heterozygosity reveals whether drift and inbreeding are eroding genetic diversity.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Several small reserves may be preferred when: (1) rare species or communities are distributed across different locations (high beta diversity), so no single large reserve would capture all species; (2) catastrophic events (disease, fire, flood) could eliminate a single large population; and (3) small reserves can be strategically placed near different habitat types. A single large reserve is preferred when: species have large home ranges, are sensitive to edge effects, or require interior habitat conditions.

In their native range, pathogens, predators, and competitors keep populations in check. When introduced to new environments without these controls, populations can grow explosively.

Other concerns include: (1) resurrected species may lack behaviors learned through culture (e.g., migration routes), (2) suitable habitat may no longer exist, (3) resurrected populations would be extremely small with minimal genetic diversity, and (4) re-establishing ecological interactions may be impossible.

It also considers spatial design criteria (compactness, connectivity) and existing protected areas. Marxan generates many near-optimal solutions, allowing decision-makers to choose among alternatives based on social, economic, and political feasibility. This approach replaced ad hoc reserve selection and has been applied in over 100 countries.",

By collecting and analyzing water or soil samples, researchers can detect the presence of species without capturing or even observing them. eDNA is particularly valuable for: (1) detecting rare/elusive species (endangered fish, amphibians, invasive species), (2) non-invasive monitoring (no handling or disturbance), (3) surveying large areas efficiently, and (4) detecting species at low densities. Limitations include degradation over time (days-weeks in water), inability to distinguish live from dead organisms, and potential false positives from contamination.",

      "explanation": "Empty forests (Redford 1992) appear intact from satellite imagery but have lost their large mammals and birds to hunting (bushmeat trade, poaching). This 'defaunation' has cascading ecological effects: (1) loss of seed dispersers (large primates, hornbills, toucans) reduces tree species recruitment by 50-80% for large-seeded species; (2) loss of large herbivores alters vegetation structure; (3) loss of predators releases mesopredator populations; (4) loss of frugivores shifts tree community composition toward wind-dispersed species. Over time, empty forests change in species composition and may have reduced carbon storage. The syndrome highlights that forest 'protection' without anti-poaching enforcement is insufficient.",

      "question": "Evaluate these statements about the economics of conservation:\nI. The global cost of effectively protecting the existing protected area network is estimated at $10-30 billion per year\nII. The economic value of ecosystem services provided by biodiversity far exceeds the cost of conservation\nIII. Most countries currently spend enough on conservation to meet their biodiversity protection goals\nIV. Market-based instruments (carbon credits, PES) can supplement but not replace public funding for conservation",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "I. TRUE: Estimates suggest $10-30 billion/yr is needed for effective protected area management globally (current spending is ~$10 billion, leaving a significant funding gap). II. TRUE: Global ecosystem services are valued at $125-145 trillion/yr (Costanza et al.), far exceeding conservation costs. III. FALSE: Most countries, especially in the tropics where biodiversity is greatest, have major conservation funding gaps. The biodiversity finance gap is estimated at $598-824 billion/yr. IV. TRUE: Market-based instruments provide important funding streams but cannot fully replace public investment because many ecosystem services are public goods (non-excludable, non-rival) that markets underprovide.",

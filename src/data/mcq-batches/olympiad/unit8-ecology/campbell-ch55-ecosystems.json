      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "NEP = GPP - total ecosystem respiration = GPP - (Ra + Rh) = 2,500 - (1,500 + 600) = 400 g C/m\u00b2/yr. NEP represents the net carbon accumulation in the ecosystem. NPP = GPP - Ra = 1,000 g C/m\u00b2/yr, but NEP further subtracts heterotrophic respiration from NPP.",

      "explanation": "The largest fraction of energy assimilated at each trophic level is lost through cellular respiration, which converts chemical energy to heat for metabolic maintenance, activity, and growth. While incomplete ingestion and egestion contribute to losses, respiration typically accounts for 60-90% of assimilated energy loss at each trophic level.",

Ecosystem A (terrestrial forest) shows a classic upright biomass pyramid, while Ecosystem B (open ocean) shows an inverted biomass pyramid. What best explains the inverted pyramid in Ecosystem B?",
      "options": [
        "Phytoplankton have very high turnover rates despite low standing biomass",

        "Ocean temperatures reduce metabolic costs for zooplankton"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In open ocean ecosystems, phytoplankton have extremely rapid reproduction and turnover rates (dividing every 1-2 days), so their standing crop biomass at any moment can be less than that of zooplankton consumers. However, the productivity pyramid remains upright because phytoplankton production per unit time exceeds consumer production. This demonstrates that biomass pyramids can be inverted when producers have much shorter generation times than consumers.",

Nitrogenase reduces C\u2082H\u2082 to C\u2082H\u2084, which can be detected by gas chromatography. Nitrogenase is extremely oxygen-sensitive (irreversibly inhibited by O\u2082).

        "Rapid leaching of nutrients from the organic layer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Boreal forests accumulate thick organic layers primarily because low temperatures dramatically slow microbial decomposition rates. Additionally, conifer litter creates acidic conditions (pH 3.5-4.5) that further inhibit bacterial decomposers. While lignin content does contribute to slow decomposition, the dominant factor is the cold, acidic environment. Fungi adapted to cold climates do exist in boreal systems but cannot overcome the thermodynamic constraints on decomposition rates.",

        "Ecosystems may function as superorganisms with resource sharing among individuals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The discovery that CMNs can transfer carbon, nitrogen, and water between trees (including between species) suggests that forest ecosystems may function as interconnected superorganisms rather than collections of competing individuals. This challenges the individualistic view of ecosystems and supports the idea that facilitation and cooperation play important roles in ecosystem function. However, trees are mutualistic (not parasitic) with mycorrhizae, and competition still occurs alongside facilitation.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The biological pump primarily operates through the gravitational sinking of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the form of fecal pellets, dead organisms, and aggregates collectively known as marine snow. This passive sinking accounts for the majority of carbon export from the euphotic zone to the deep ocean (~6-12 Gt C/yr). While diel vertical migration by zooplankton (the 'migrant pump') does contribute, sinking particles represent the dominant flux.",

      "question": "A researcher tracks nutrient spiraling in a stream ecosystem. Dissolved nitrogen enters the stream and travels an average of 150 m before being taken up by algae (uptake length). The algae are consumed by invertebrates, which release nitrogen back into dissolved form after traveling 50 m downstream. What is the total spiraling length, and what does a shorter spiraling length indicate about ecosystem function?",
      "options": [
        "200 m; shorter spiraling length indicates less efficient nutrient retention",
        "100 m; shorter spiraling length indicates faster water flow",
        "200 m; shorter spiraling length indicates more efficient nutrient retention",
        "150 m; shorter spiraling length indicates higher decomposition rates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nutrient spiraling length = uptake length + turnover length = 150 m + 50 m = 200 m. This represents one complete spiral of nutrient cycling in the stream. A shorter spiraling length indicates that nutrients are being taken up and recycled more quickly, meaning the ecosystem retains nutrients more efficiently. Streams with high biological activity, abundant algae, and complex substrates typically have shorter spiraling lengths. This concept uniquely combines downstream transport with nutrient cycling in lotic ecosystems.",

It cycles through rock weathering \u2192 soil \u2192 organisms \u2192 sediments on geological timescales. This makes phosphorus the most likely nutrient to limit primary productivity in freshwater ecosystems and means that human additions (from mining phosphate rock for fertilizer) cannot be removed from ecosystems through atmospheric processes, leading to persistent eutrophication problems.",

      "explanation": "A 2\u00d72 factorial design manipulating both nutrients (bottom-up) and predators (top-down) simultaneously allows the researcher to distinguish the independent and interactive effects of these forces. This design includes: (1) control (no nutrients, no fish), (2) nutrients only, (3) fish only, and (4) both nutrients and fish. Comparing across treatments reveals whether productivity is controlled primarily by nutrient availability, predation pressure, or their interaction. Single-factor manipulations and observational comparisons cannot distinguish these mechanisms.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Novel ecosystems form when environmental changes (climate change, invasive species, land use change) create species assemblages with no historical precedent. These ecosystems may still provide valuable ecosystem services (carbon storage, water filtration, habitat) despite having different species composition than historical ecosystems. This challenges traditional restoration goals that aim to return ecosystems to a historical baseline, as some novel ecosystems may be more resilient and functional than attempted restorations to historical states.",

      "explanation": "When nitrogen inputs exceed ecosystem capacity for uptake and retention (nitrogen saturation), excess nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) leaches from soils into groundwater and surface waters. This is the most direct first consequence because once biological demand is met, the highly mobile nitrate ion moves with water. Downstream effects include eutrophication, acidification of soils and water bodies, and contribution to coastal hypoxic zones. Nitrogen deposition actually tends to decrease soil pH (acidification), not increase it.",

      "explanation": "The rapid movement of \u00b3\u00b2P from dissolved form into biota (within 30 days, only 5% remains dissolved) demonstrates fast biological cycling. However, 69% ending up in sediments shows that sediment burial is the dominant fate of phosphorus in lake ecosystems.

      "explanation": "The classic eutrophication cascade: excess nutrients (especially P and N) stimulate massive algal growth (bloom). When the bloom collapses, dead algal biomass sinks and is decomposed by aerobic bacteria. Bacterial decomposition consumes dissolved oxygen faster than it can be replenished through atmospheric diffusion and photosynthesis, creating hypoxic (< 2 mg O\u2082/L) or anoxic conditions. Fish and other aerobic organisms suffocate. While some algal blooms do produce toxins (harmful algal blooms), the hypoxia pathway is the most common mechanism for eutrophication-driven fish kills.",

This 'priming' can offset or even exceed the additional carbon inputs, resulting in no net change (or even a decrease) in soil carbon stocks. This demonstrates that increased plant growth does not automatically translate to increased carbon sequestration in soil\u2014the response of soil microbial communities is critical.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This is a key principle of ecological stoichiometry (Sterner & Elser 2002). When consumers with low C:P body ratios (high P demand) eat food with high C:P ratios (P-poor), they must process excess carbon while retaining scarce phosphorus. The excess carbon is respired as CO\u2082 or excreted as DOC, while phosphorus is retained for growth. This process, called 'consumer-driven nutrient recycling,' means that the stoichiometric mismatch between consumers and food determines nutrient recycling ratios. Daphnia, with their P-rich ribosomal RNA for rapid growth, exemplify this pattern and effectively concentrate P while releasing C.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The HSS (Hairston, Smith, Slobodkin 1960) hypothesis asks: 'Why is the world green?' If herbivores are limited only by food supply, they should consume all vegetation. The hypothesis proposes that predators regulate herbivore populations below the level that would defoliate plants, keeping the world green. This top-down control argument (predators \u2192 fewer herbivores \u2192 more vegetation) was foundational in ecology and predated the modern concept of trophic cascades. Alternative hypotheses include bottom-up limitation (plant defenses make much vegetation inedible) and physical factors limiting herbivore populations.",

After the plants accumulate metals, the biomass is harvested and disposed of (phytomining). Examples include Thlaspi caerulescens (zinc/cadmium hyperaccumulator) and Pteris vittata (arsenic hyperaccumulator fern). Bioaugmentation adds microorganisms, biostimulation adds nutrients to enhance existing microbial degradation, and mycoremediation uses fungi.

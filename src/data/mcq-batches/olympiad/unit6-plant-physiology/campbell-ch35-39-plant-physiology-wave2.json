      "question": "In Arabidopsis, the WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor and the CLAVATA (CLV) signaling pathway form a negative feedback loop in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). If a loss-of-function mutation occurs in CLV3 (the ligand for the CLV1 receptor kinase), what phenotype would you predict?",
      "options": [
        "The SAM terminates prematurely because stem cells are not maintained",
        "The root apical meristem enlarges but the shoot meristem is unaffected",
        "Lateral organ primordia fail to initiate because CLV3 is required for organ boundary specification",
        "The SAM enlarges dramatically due to unrestricted WUS expression and stem cell overproliferation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The WUS-CLV feedback loop maintains SAM homeostasis. WUS, expressed in the organizing center, promotes stem cell identity and induces CLV3 expression in the central zone. CLV3 peptide binds the CLV1 receptor kinase, which signals to repress WUS transcription, limiting stem cell number. Loss of CLV3 eliminates this negative feedback: WUS expression expands unchecked, leading to excessive stem cell accumulation and a dramatically enlarged, fasciated meristem. This is a classic Arabidopsis phenotype. Option A describes the opposite (WUS loss-of-function). Option C is incorrect because organ initiation depends on auxin maxima, not CLV3. Option B is wrong because CLV3 acts primarily in the SAM, though the related CLE peptide family functions in the RAM via a WOX5/CLE40 pathway.",

      "question": "A cross-section of a woody dicot stem reveals a ring of vascular cambium. Which of the following correctly describes the pattern of cell division and differentiation in this lateral meristem?",
      "options": [
        "Vascular cambium divides only periclinally, producing secondary xylem toward the outside and secondary phloem toward the pith",
        "Vascular cambium divides periclinally, producing secondary xylem centripetally (toward the pith) and secondary phloem centrifugally (toward the bark), with far more xylem produced than phloem",
        "Vascular cambium produces equal amounts of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, both through anticlinal divisions",
        "Vascular cambium produces secondary xylem from fusiform initials only and secondary phloem from ray initials only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The vascular cambium is a lateral meristem that undergoes periclinal (tangential) divisions to produce secondary vascular tissues. Cells cut off toward the interior (centripetally, toward the pith) differentiate into secondary xylem (wood), while cells cut off toward the exterior (centrifugally) differentiate into secondary phloem. The cambium produces substantially more xylem than phloem, which is why wood accumulates massively while the phloem layer remains relatively thin. The cambium also undergoes anticlinal (radial) divisions to increase its circumference as the stem expands, but these do not directly produce vascular tissues. Both fusiform initials (producing axial elements) and ray initials (producing ray parenchyma) contribute to both xylem and phloem, not one each.",

      "question": "A plant physiologist measures the water potential components of a cell and obtains: Ψs = -0.8 MPa and Ψp = 0.3 MPa. This cell is placed in a solution with Ψs = -0.4 MPa (open container, Ψp = 0). What will happen and what is the equilibrium state?",
      "options": [
        "Water moves into the cell because the cell has lower water potential; at equilibrium the cell becomes more turgid",
        "Water moves out of the cell because the external solution has higher water potential (-0.4 MPa > -0.5 MPa); at equilibrium the cell loses turgor and may plasmolyze",
        "No net water movement occurs because the solute potentials are both negative",
        "Water moves into the cell initially, then reverses direction as turgor pressure builds"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Water potential (Ψw) = Ψs + Ψp. For the cell: Ψw = -0.8 + 0.3 = -0.5 MPa. For the external solution (open container, so Ψp = 0): Ψw = -0.4 + 0 = -0.4 MPa. Water moves from regions of higher Ψw to lower Ψw. Since -0.4 MPa (solution) > -0.5 MPa (cell), water enters the cell by osmosis. As water enters, the cell's Ψp increases and Ψs becomes less negative (dilution), raising Ψw until equilibrium is reached when Ψw(cell) = Ψw(solution) = -0.4 MPa. At equilibrium, if the cell Ψs dilutes to approximately -0.7 MPa, then Ψp would be 0.3 MPa. The cell becomes more turgid. Option B reverses the direction. Option C ignores the Ψp component. Option D incorrectly describes flow reversal.",

      "question": "The Casparian strip in the root endodermis is composed primarily of suberin and lignin deposited in the radial and transverse walls. What is the primary physiological consequence of this structure for mineral ion transport?",
      "options": [
        "It prevents all water from entering the vascular cylinder, forcing water to be actively pumped by root pressure",
        "It creates a reservoir of ions in the cortex that can be released during drought stress",
        "It forces water and dissolved solutes moving via the apoplast to cross the selectively permeable plasma membrane of endodermal cells before entering the stele, enabling the plant to regulate ion uptake",
        "It prevents backflow of water from the xylem to the cortex by creating a one-way valve mechanism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Casparian strip blocks the apoplastic pathway at the endodermis by sealing the spaces between endodermal cell walls. Minerals and water that have traveled through the apoplast (cell walls and intercellular spaces) in the cortex cannot bypass endodermal cells. They must enter the symplast by crossing the selectively permeable plasma membrane of the endodermal cells, which contains specific ion channels and transporters. This gives the plant control over which minerals enter the xylem and at what concentrations, functioning as a selective filter. Option A is wrong because water can still enter via the symplastic and transmembrane pathways. Option B describes no real function of the Casparian strip. Option D is partially relevant (backflow prevention occurs) but is not the primary function — selective ion regulation is the key role.",

      "question": "According to the pressure-flow (Munch) hypothesis of phloem transport, sucrose loading into sieve-tube elements at the source creates a high osmotic pressure that drives bulk flow to sinks. Which of the following would most directly inhibit phloem loading in an apoplastic loader?",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In apoplastic phloem loading, sucrose is exported from mesophyll cells into the apoplast and then actively loaded into the companion cell-sieve element complex by a sucrose-H+ symporter (SUT1/SUC2). This secondary active transport is driven by the proton motive force generated by H+-ATPases on the companion cell plasma membrane. A protonophore like CCCP would dissipate the H+ gradient, abolishing the driving force for sucrose uptake. Without active loading, sucrose cannot accumulate to high concentrations in the sieve tube, and the osmotic gradient required for pressure flow collapses. Option B would affect sink unloading, not source loading. Option C would reduce water influx but not sucrose loading directly. Option D affects mineral nutrition but K+ is not directly required for sucrose-H+ symport.",

      "options": [
        "Leghemoglobin in the nodule cytosol binds O2 with high affinity, buffering free O2 at very low concentrations (~10 nM) while delivering it to bacteroid terminal oxidases for respiration",
        "Nodule cells are entirely anaerobic and generate ATP exclusively through fermentation",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Leghemoglobin is a plant-encoded oxygen-binding protein (analogous to animal myoglobin) present at high concentrations (~1 mM) in the cytosol of infected nodule cells. It binds O2 with very high affinity (Kd ~10 nM), maintaining free O2 at approximately 10 nM — low enough to protect nitrogenase from irreversible oxidation. However, bound O2 is continuously delivered to the bacteroid surface, where high-affinity terminal oxidases (cytochrome bd, cytochrome cbb3) accept it for aerobic respiration. This produces the 16 ATP per N2 required by nitrogenase. The nodule cortex also has an oxygen diffusion barrier, but it is leghemoglobin that critically buffers intracellular O2. Option B is wrong because 16 ATP per N2 cannot be generated by fermentation alone. Options C and D describe mechanisms that would not supply sufficient ATP.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In double fertilization, one sperm cell fuses with the egg to form the diploid zygote (1 maternal + 1 paternal). The second sperm cell fuses with the central cell, which contains two polar nuclei (both derived from the same megaspore mother cell through megagametogenesis and thus both maternal). The resulting primary endosperm nucleus is triploid: 2n maternal + 1n paternal. This 2m:1p genomic ratio is critical for normal endosperm development and is the basis of the endosperm balance number concept and genomic imprinting in seeds. Deviation from this 2:1 ratio (as in interploidy crosses) often causes endosperm failure. Option A incorrectly states two sperm contribute. Option C confuses antipodal cells with polar nuclei. Option B invokes a nonexistent second pollen tube.",

        "FT is produced in the shoot apical meristem, travels basipetally through the phloem, and induces flowering in lateral buds",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "FT protein is the molecular identity of florigen, the long-sought systemic flowering signal. Under inductive long-day conditions in Arabidopsis, the photoreceptor-mediated pathway activates CONSTANS (CO) protein in leaf phloem companion cells, which transcriptionally activates FT expression. FT protein (not mRNA) is loaded into sieve elements and transported through the phloem to the shoot apical meristem. At the SAM, FT interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FD in a complex that activates floral meristem identity genes, particularly AP1 (APETALA1) and SOC1. This triggers the irreversible transition from vegetative to reproductive development. Option A reverses the source and direction. Option B incorrectly places FT production in roots and transport in xylem. Option D incorrectly identifies FT mRNA rather than protein as the mobile signal.",

        "Auxin binds to ABP1 in the cytoplasm → activates MAP kinase cascade → phosphorylates expansins → expansins break cellulose microfibrils",
        "Auxin binds to TIR1 (nuclear receptor) → activates gene transcription of proton pump genes → H+-ATPases are synthesized de novo → wall acidification occurs hours later",
        "Auxin activates plasma membrane H+-ATPases (via phosphorylation of the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain), pumping H+ into the cell wall → lowered apoplastic pH activates expansins → expansins disrupt hydrogen bonds between cellulose and hemicellulose → turgor-driven cell expansion",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The acid growth hypothesis, supported by extensive evidence, proceeds as follows: auxin (IAA) rapidly activates plasma membrane H+-ATPases, in part through SAUR proteins that inhibit PP2C.D phosphatases, keeping the H+-ATPase C-terminal regulatory domain phosphorylated (active). Protons are pumped into the cell wall space, lowering apoplastic pH from ~5.5 to ~4.5. At this acidic pH, expansins (non-enzymatic wall-loosening proteins) become active and disrupt the non-covalent hydrogen bonds between cellulose microfibrils and hemicellulose (xyloglucan) chains. This wall loosening reduces wall pressure (Ψp of wall), allowing turgor-driven water uptake and irreversible cell expansion. Option A incorrectly claims expansins break cellulose (they disrupt H-bonds between polymers, not covalent bonds). Option B conflates the rapid acid growth response (minutes) with slower transcriptional effects. Option D incorrectly describes vacuolar H+ release and wall disintegration.",

What is the molecular state of phytochrome under these conditions and what physiological response does it trigger?",

        "Most phytochrome exists as Pfr (the active form), which inhibits stem elongation to keep the plant compact under the canopy",

        "The R:FR ratio does not affect phytochrome; only absolute light intensity determines the shade avoidance response"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phytochrome exists in two photointerconvertible forms: Pr (red-absorbing, inactive, λmax = 660 nm) and Pfr (far-red-absorbing, biologically active, λmax = 730 nm). Red light converts Pr to Pfr; far-red light converts Pfr back to Pr. Under a canopy, chlorophyll in overhead leaves absorbs red light but transmits far-red, creating a low R:FR ratio. This shifts the phytochrome equilibrium toward the Pr form, reducing the Pfr/Ptotal ratio. Since Pfr is the form that suppresses shade avoidance, low Pfr levels de-repress shade avoidance syndrome (SAS): increased stem/petiole elongation (via auxin and gibberellin pathways), hyponastic leaf movement, reduced branching, and accelerated flowering. This is mediated primarily by phyB, whose depletion stabilizes PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) transcription factors. Option A reverses the phytochrome response.

        "S2: TRUE — Auxin is perceived intracellularly by the TIR1/AFB family of F-box proteins, which are components of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex; auxin acts as molecular glue between TIR1 and Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, targeting them for proteasomal degradation",
        "S3: TRUE — AUX1/LAX influx carriers are required for auxin uptake into cells because IAA in its protonated form (IAAH) at the acidic apoplastic pH can freely diffuse across the membrane, but the deprotonated form (IAA-) inside the cell cannot exit without PIN efflux carriers",
        "S4: TRUE — Auxin promotes its own transport by upregulating PIN expression through a positive feedback loop, which explains canalization theory and the formation of auxin transport channels during vascular development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "TTTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — PIN proteins are auxin efflux carriers with polarized subcellular localization. PIN1, for example, is basally localized in vascular cells, driving basipetal auxin transport. The ARF-GEF GNOM is essential for PIN recycling: brefeldin A (a GNOM inhibitor) causes PIN internalization and disrupts polar auxin transport. S2: TRUE — This is the canonical auxin signaling mechanism. TIR1 is an F-box protein in the SCF^TIR1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. IAA (auxin) binds in a pocket between TIR1 and the degron domain of Aux/IAA proteins, promoting their ubiquitination and 26S proteasomal degradation. This releases ARF (Auxin Response Factor) transcription factors to activate auxin-responsive genes. S3: TRUE — The chemiosmotic model of polar auxin transport: in the acidic apoplast (pH ~5.5), ~15-20% of IAA is protonated (IAAH, pKa = 4.75), which diffuses passively into cells. Inside the cell (pH ~7.0), IAAH deprotonates to IAA-, which is membrane-impermeant and requires PIN efflux carriers to exit. AUX1/LAX importers enhance uptake of the anionic form. S4: TRUE — Auxin-mediated upregulation of PIN expression creates positive feedback: where auxin flux is higher, more PINs are recruited, channeling even more auxin. This self-reinforcing mechanism underlies Sachs' canalization hypothesis, explaining how initially diffuse auxin flow becomes focused into narrow channels that prefigure vascular strands.",

DELLAs physically bind PIFs (PIF3, PIF4), preventing them from binding to G-box promoter elements and activating genes for cell elongation and chlorophyll biosynthesis. S2: FALSE — This statement has the mechanism backwards. GA promotes growth by DESTABILIZING (degrading) DELLA proteins, not stabilizing them. When DELLAs are degraded, growth-promoting transcription factors like PIFs are released to activate their targets. S3: TRUE — This describes the canonical GA signaling pathway: GA binds GID1 receptor → GID1-GA-DELLA complex forms → SCF^SLY1/GID2 E3 ligase recognizes the complex → DELLA is polyubiquitinated → 26S proteasome degrades DELLA → growth-promoting TFs are released. S4: TRUE — Semi-dominant Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b alleles encode DELLA proteins with mutations in the DELLA domain (the GA-GID1 interaction surface), making them insensitive to GA-triggered degradation.

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The nitrogenase reaction is: N2 + 8H+ + 8e- + 16ATP → 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi. The obligatory production of H2 (wasting 2 electrons and 4 ATP) is an intrinsic feature of the nitrogenase mechanism and reduces its efficiency. Some rhizobia have uptake hydrogenases that recapture this H2. S2: FALSE — Nod factors are NOT lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and do NOT trigger immune responses. Nod factors are lipochitooligosaccharides (modified chitin oligomers with a fatty acid chain) produced by rhizobia. They are recognized by specific LysM receptor kinases (NFR1/NFR5 in Lotus, LYK3/NFP in Medicago) on the root hair cell surface. This triggers a symbiotic signaling cascade (calcium spiking, ENOD gene expression, root hair curling) — the opposite of an immune response.

ETR1 and related receptors are ER-membrane-localized dimeric proteins with copper(I) as the ethylene-binding cofactor (delivered by the RAN1/Responsive to Antagonist 1 copper transporter). Without ethylene, receptors activate CTR1 kinase, which phosphorylates EIN2 and targets it for degradation, suppressing the pathway. Ethylene binding INACTIVATES the receptors, turning OFF CTR1.

Crucially, ECM hyphae never penetrate the host cell membrane. S2: FALSE — While AM fungi do penetrate the cortical cell wall to form intracellular arbuscules, they do NOT penetrate the plasma membrane. The host plasma membrane invaginates around the arbuscule branches, creating a periarbuscular membrane (PAM) that separates the fungal tissue from the plant cytoplasm. The interface between PAM and fungal cell wall (the periarbuscular space) is where nutrient exchange occurs via specific transporters (e.g., plant PT4 phosphate transporter on the PAM). S3: TRUE — The CSM pathway is shared between AM fungi and rhizobia, reflecting the evolutionary co-option of the older AM signaling pathway by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Key shared components include: Myc/Nod factor perception → activation of DMI1/CASTOR-POLLUX (nuclear envelope ion channels) → calcium oscillations → CCaMK/DMI3 decodes calcium signal → CYCLOPS/IPD3 transcription factor activation.

Comparing A vs B: humidity drops from 60% to 30% while everything else is constant — transpiration nearly doubles (3.2 → 5.8), because lower humidity increases the leaf-to-air water vapor gradient. Comparing A vs C: wind increases from 0.5 to 3.0 m/s — transpiration increases (3.2 → 4.9) because wind reduces the boundary layer (unstirred air layer) around the leaf, decreasing boundary layer resistance. Comparing A vs D: temperature rises from 25°C to 35°C at constant 60% RH — transpiration increases (3.2 → 5.1) because higher temperature increases the saturated vapor pressure inside the leaf more than the ambient vapor pressure, increasing VPD.

      "explanation": "The data allow precise identification based on symptom location (mobility) and type: Treatment X shows interveinal chlorosis in OLDER leaves first. This pattern indicates a phloem-mobile nutrient being remobilized from old to young leaves. Magnesium is a component of the chlorophyll molecule and is phloem-mobile — deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis (veins remain green because they retain Mg longer) in older leaves first. Chlorophyll drops to 1.1 but protein is nearly normal (17.9), consistent with Mg deficiency (not N). Treatment Y shows symptoms in YOUNG leaves and meristems (apex death, distorted leaves). This indicates a phloem-IMMOBILE nutrient. Calcium is phloem-immobile and is essential for cell wall pectin cross-linking (calcium pectate), membrane stability, and cell division. Deficiency causes death of growing points and distorted young leaves (blossom end rot in tomato fruit). Normal chlorophyll (2.9) and protein (18.1) confirm it's not N or Mg. Treatment Z shows UNIFORM chlorosis in older leaves with dramatically reduced protein (8.2% vs 18.5%). Nitrogen is a component of both chlorophyll and protein, and is phloem-mobile — deficiency causes uniform (not interveinal) yellowing of older leaves first as N is remobilized, plus severe protein reduction.

This 400-fold uphill concentration from apoplast to companion cell is thermodynamically impossible by passive diffusion and requires active transport. (2) PCMBS sensitivity: PCMBS is membrane-impermeable and specifically inhibits plasma membrane sucrose transporters (SUT1/SUC2) by modifying sulfhydryl groups. The 88% inhibition of phloem loading by PCMBS demonstrates that sucrose must cross a plasma membrane (the companion cell membrane) during loading — characteristic of the apoplastic pathway. In symplastic loading (polymer trapping), sucrose moves through plasmodesmata without crossing membranes, and PCMBS would have minimal effect. (3) The low apoplastic sucrose (2 mM) represents the transient pool of sucrose exported from mesophyll cells (by SWEET efflux transporters) before active uptake by SUC2/SUT1 into companion cells.

Instead, IAA is laterally redistributed from the light side (28 ng) to the dark side (57 ng). NPA abolishes this asymmetry, confirming that active polar transport (PIN-mediated) is required. Modern research shows that blue light perceived by phototropin 1 (phot1) causes relocalization of PIN3 in endodermal cells to direct auxin toward the shaded side. (2) Acid growth correlation: The dark side shows higher H+-ATPase activity (1.5 vs 0.6), lower apoplastic pH (4.6 vs 5.8), and greater cell elongation (38 vs 15 μm/h) — exactly as predicted by the acid growth hypothesis. Higher auxin → more H+ pumping → wall acidification → expansin activation → cell elongation.

(3) Universality: Experiment 4 is remarkable — an induced SDP (Xanthium) leaf can cause flowering in an LDP (tobacco) kept in non-inductive conditions. This proves the flowering signal is the same molecule (or functionally equivalent) across species with different photoperiodic requirements. The difference between SDPs and LDPs lies in how they regulate FT production (the photoperiodic sensing mechanism in leaves), not in the nature of FT itself. (4) Experiment 3 confirms that the signal acts at the recipient meristem independently of the recipient's light conditions — even a night break (which would normally inhibit SDP flowering by converting Pfr) doesn't matter if the signal has already been produced in the donor leaf. (5) Experiment 2 is the negative control showing non-induced leaves do not produce the signal. Option A proposes an inhibitor model, contradicted by the cross-species induction. Option B is wrong because the meristem does not need to perceive light directly. Option D is contradicted by the girdling control.",

      "experimentContext": "A researcher discovers that when Arabidopsis leaves are infected with a bacterial pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae), root growth slows by 40% within 24 hours, even though the pathogen is confined to the leaves (confirmed by plating root homogenates — no bacteria detected in roots). The researcher hypothesizes that a systemic defense signal (possibly salicylic acid or jasmonic acid) travels from the infected leaf to the roots and inhibits root growth as part of a growth-defense trade-off. Available tools: (1) SA-deficient mutant (sid2, lacking isochorismate synthase), (2) JA signaling mutant (coi1), (3) split-root systems, (4) petiole girdling, (5) GUS reporter lines for SA-responsive (PR1:GUS) and JA-responsive (VSP2:GUS) promoters, (6) LC-MS for hormone quantification.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B provides the most rigorous experimental design by testing the hypothesis through multiple complementary approaches addressing both necessity, sufficiency, and mechanism: (i) Petiole girdling tests whether the signal is phloem-mobile — if girdling blocks root inhibition, a phloem-transported signal is required. This is the most direct test for systemic signaling. (ii) Genetic mutants test which pathway is NECESSARY: if sid2 (SA-deficient) shows normal root growth after infection, SA is required for root inhibition. Similarly for coi1 (JA-insensitive). (iii) Exogenous hormone application tests SUFFICIENCY: if applying SA alone to uninfected roots mimics the 40% growth reduction, SA is sufficient. (iv) Reporter genes provide spatial and temporal resolution of where and when defense pathways are activated in roots. (v) LC-MS quantification provides direct biochemical evidence of hormone accumulation in roots. Option A (hormone measurement alone) demonstrates correlation but not causation — hormones might increase without being the causal signal. Option C addresses contamination (already controlled) but doesn't test the signaling hypothesis. Option D is a useful control but doesn't identify the plant signal or its transport mechanism.",

      "experimentContext": "Researchers investigate the role of polar auxin transport in lateral root formation. They treat Arabidopsis seedlings with NPA (naphthylphthalamic acid, a polar auxin transport inhibitor that blocks PIN efflux carriers) and observe that lateral root initiation is almost completely abolished. They also generate transgenic plants overexpressing PIN1 specifically in pericycle cells (the lateral root founder cells) using the GATA23 promoter. They hypothesize that if polar auxin transport is the causal factor, restoring auxin efflux in founder cells should rescue lateral root formation even in the presence of NPA. Available tools: (1) DR5:GFP auxin response reporter, (2) PIN1-GFP translational fusion, (3) IAA quantification by LC-MS, (4) various auxin-related mutants (pin1, pin3, pin7, tir1), (5) exogenous IAA application, (6) iaa28 gain-of-function mutant (constitutive Aux/IAA repressor, blocks auxin signaling).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The critical concern is whether NPA's effect on lateral root formation is specifically due to disrupted polar auxin transport or could involve non-specific/off-target effects (NPA can also affect vesicle trafficking). Option B addresses this with a well-designed multi-pronged approach: (1) The iaa28 gain-of-function mutant constitutively represses auxin-responsive gene expression regardless of auxin levels. If iaa28 alone abolishes lateral roots (demonstrating auxin signaling is required), and NPA treatment of iaa28 shows no additional reduction, this epistasis analysis confirms NPA acts through the auxin signaling pathway, not through an independent mechanism. (2) DR5:GFP imaging in NPA-treated roots directly visualizes whether auxin response maxima (which normally mark lateral root founder cells at xylem pole pericycle positions) are disrupted. Loss of these maxima upon NPA treatment provides visual confirmation that auxin transport disruption prevents the local auxin accumulation needed for founder cell specification. Together, these experiments establish that NPA's effect operates through the auxin signaling pathway and correlates with loss of localized auxin responses. Option A is informative but exogenous IAA application floods all tissues non-specifically and doesn't rescue polar transport directionality. Option C merely intensifies the treatment without addressing specificity. Option D is a basic control but doesn't address the mechanism question.",

        "S1: TRUE — Upon pathogen recognition by intracellular NLR (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat) receptors, the hypersensitive response (HR) is triggered, involving rapid programmed cell death at the infection site mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and nitric oxide (NO) signaling",
        "S2: TRUE — Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) requires the mobile signal methyl salicylate (MeSA), which is converted back to salicylic acid (SA) in distal tissues; SA then activates NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1), which translocates to the nucleus as a monomer and functions as a transcriptional co-activator of PR (pathogenesis-related) genes by interacting with TGA transcription factors",
        "S3: FALSE — Jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways always act synergistically to amplify defense responses against all types of pathogens simultaneously",
        "S4: TRUE — The jasmonate signaling pathway operates through the COI1 F-box protein (a component of the SCF^COI1 E3 ubiquitin ligase), which, upon binding jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), targets JAZ (Jasmonate ZIM-domain) transcriptional repressors for proteasomal degradation, releasing MYC2 and other transcription factors to activate JA-responsive defense genes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — NLR receptors (also called R proteins) detect pathogen effectors directly or indirectly (guard/decoy model). Recognition triggers the hypersensitive response (HR): a rapid, localized cell death program. Key events include an oxidative burst (RBOHD-generated superoxide converted to H2O2), NO production, ion fluxes (Ca2+ influx, K+/H+ exchange), callose deposition, and activation of metacaspases. The HR confines biotrophic pathogens by killing host cells they depend on. S2: TRUE — SAR is a long-lasting, broad-spectrum defense activated systemically after local infection. MeSA (produced from SA by SAMT) serves as a phloem-mobile signal. In systemic tissues, MeSA is converted back to SA by MeSA esterase (SABP2). SA binds NPR1, which normally exists as an oligomer in the cytoplasm via intermolecular disulfide bonds. SA-induced redox changes (mediated by thioredoxins) reduce these bonds, releasing NPR1 monomers that enter the nucleus and interact with TGA bZIP transcription factors to activate PR gene expression (PR1, PR2/glucanase, PR5/thaumatin-like). S3: FALSE — JA and SA pathways are generally ANTAGONISTIC, not synergistic. SA suppresses JA signaling (via NPR1-dependent and -independent mechanisms), and JA can suppress SA responses. This antagonism reflects a trade-off: SA primarily defends against biotrophic pathogens, while JA/ET pathways defend against necrotrophs and herbivores. Simultaneous activation of both would be energetically wasteful and could compromise defense specificity. S4: TRUE — JA-Ile (the bioactive jasmonate) binds in a pocket between COI1 and the Jas domain of JAZ proteins (analogous to auxin-TIR1-Aux/IAA). This promotes JAZ ubiquitination and 26S proteasomal degradation, releasing MYC2 (a bHLH transcription factor) and other TFs (MYC3, MYC4) to activate defense genes including PDF1.2, VSP2, and LOX2.",

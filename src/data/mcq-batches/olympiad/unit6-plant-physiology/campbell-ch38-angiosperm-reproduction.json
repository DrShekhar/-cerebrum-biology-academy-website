      "question": "In angiosperms, the female gametophyte (embryo sac) typically develops through megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis. What is the fate of the four megaspores produced by meiosis of the megaspore mother cell in the Polygonum-type embryo sac?",
      "options": [
        "All four megaspores undergo mitosis to form a multicellular gametophyte",
        "All four megaspores are released as microspores that develop into pollen grains",

        "Three megaspores degenerate, and the surviving functional megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce an 8-nucleate, 7-celled embryo sac"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the Polygonum-type embryo sac (the most common pattern, found in approximately 70% of angiosperms), the megaspore mother cell (megasporocyte, 2n) undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores arranged in a linear tetrad. Three of these megaspores (typically the three closest to the micropyle) degenerate through programmed cell death. The single surviving functional megaspore (usually the chalazal-most) undergoes three consecutive rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis, producing an 8-nucleate coenocyte. Subsequent cellularization creates the 7-celled embryo sac: 3 antipodal cells at the chalazal end, 2 synergids flanking the egg cell at the micropylar end, the egg cell itself, and the large central cell containing 2 polar nuclei. The synergids play crucial roles in pollen tube guidance through secretion of attractant peptides (LURE proteins), and the central cell's polar nuclei will fuse with one sperm during double fertilization to form the triploid endosperm.",

      "options": [
        "One sperm fuses with the egg (producing a 2n zygote) and one sperm fuses with one synergid (producing a 2n accessory embryo)",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Double fertilization involves two simultaneous fertilization events within the embryo sac. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell (n), producing a diploid (2n) zygote that develops into the embryo. The second sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei (each n) in the central cell, producing a triploid (3n) primary endosperm nucleus that develops into the endosperm\u2014the nutritive tissue that supports embryo development and, in many species, provides nutrition for the germinating seedling. This process is unique to angiosperms (and Ephedra among gymnosperms, though with different outcomes). The triploid endosperm is genetically 2:1 maternal to paternal, which has implications for genomic imprinting. Double fertilization ensures that endosperm develops only when fertilization occurs, preventing wasteful investment in nutritive tissue without a viable embryo. The synergids facilitate pollen tube reception and burst, and the antipodal cells may have nutritive functions but are not fertilized.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) of Brassicaceae, compatibility is determined by the diploid S-genotype of the pollen-producing parent (sporophyte), not the haploid genotype of the pollen grain itself. This occurs because the pollen coat proteins responsible for the SI response are synthesized by the diploid tapetum cells (which line the anther locule) and deposited onto the pollen grain surface during pollen maturation. The key male determinant is SCR/SP11 (S-locus Cysteine-Rich protein), a small cysteine-rich peptide encoded at the S-locus that is expressed in the tapetum and deposited on the pollen coat. On the stigma surface, the female determinant is the SRK (S-locus Receptor Kinase), a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase. When SCR from the pollen coat matches the SRK on the stigma (i.e., they share the same S-haplotype), SRK is activated, triggering a signaling cascade through ARC1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) that leads to rejection of the pollen.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pollen tube guidance occurs in multiple stages with different molecular mechanisms. The final, short-range attraction of the pollen tube to the micropyle of the ovule is mediated by LURE peptides\u2014small, secreted defensin-like cysteine-rich polypeptides (CRPs) produced specifically by the synergid cells of the embryo sac. In Torenia fournieri, where the embryo sac protrudes from the ovule allowing direct observation, LURE1 and LURE2 were identified as the attractants. In Arabidopsis, AtLURE1 peptides serve the same function. These peptides are secreted from the synergid cells through the filiform apparatus (specialized cell wall invaginations at the micropylar end of synergids) and diffuse toward the micropyle, creating a concentration gradient that guides the pollen tube tip. The pollen tube perceives LURE through receptor kinases on its tip membrane (PRK6 in Arabidopsis). Earlier stages of pollen tube guidance involve TTS (Transmitting Tissue-Specific) glycoproteins and AGPs in the style, but these provide funicular guidance, not the final micropylar targeting.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ABC model, proposed by Coen and Meyerowitz (1991), explains floral organ identity through combinatorial expression of three classes of homeotic genes across four concentric whorls: Whorl 1 (outermost): A function alone specifies sepals; Whorl 2: A + B functions together specify petals; Whorl 3: B + C functions together specify stamens; Whorl 4 (innermost): C function alone specifies carpels. In Arabidopsis, A-function genes include APETALA1 (AP1) and APETALA2 (AP2); B-function genes include APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI); C-function gene is AGAMOUS (AG). The model predicts that loss of A function causes C to expand into whorls 1-2, converting sepals to carpels and petals to stamens. Loss of B converts petals to sepals and stamens to carpels. Loss of C converts stamens to petals and carpels to sepals. The model has been extended to ABCDE, with D-function genes specifying ovule identity and E-function (SEPALLATA) genes required as co-factors for all organ identities.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Gametophytic apomixis involves the formation of an unreduced (2n) embryo sac that develops into a seed without fertilization. There are two main pathways: (1) Diplospory\u2014the megaspore mother cell itself bypasses or modifies meiosis (either skipping meiosis entirely or undergoing a modified meiosis that restores the diploid chromosome number through restitution), producing an unreduced embryo sac; (2) Apospory\u2014a somatic nucellar cell adjacent to the megaspore mother cell develops directly into an unreduced embryo sac without meiosis, often displacing the normal meiotically-derived embryo sac. In both cases, the unreduced egg cell within the embryo sac develops parthenogenetically into a 2n embryo without fertilization, producing offspring that are genetically identical to the mother plant. Endosperm development may still require fertilization (pseudogamous apomixis) or may develop autonomously. This contrasts with adventitious embryony (option A), which is sporophytic apomixis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The tapetum is the innermost cell layer of the anther wall that surrounds developing microspores and plays indispensable roles in pollen development. Its primary functions include: (1) Providing nutrients (sugars, amino acids, lipids) to the avascular developing microspores; (2) Synthesizing and secreting sporopollenin precursors\u2014the extremely resistant biopolymer that forms the outer exine wall of pollen grains. Sporopollenin is one of the most chemically resistant biological polymers known; (3) Depositing pollen coat (tryphine/pollenkitt) materials including lipids, proteins, flavonoids, and (in SSI species) SCR/SP11 compatibility determinants; (4) Producing callase (beta-1,3-glucanase) that dissolves the callose wall surrounding microspore tetrads, releasing individual microspores. The tapetum typically undergoes programmed cell death (PCD) during the later stages of pollen development, releasing its cellular contents into the anther locule for incorporation into pollen walls and coats. Tapetum dysfunction (e.g., in male-sterile mutants) results in defective pollen development.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Nuclear endosperm development is the most common pattern among angiosperms, particularly in eudicots. After double fertilization, the triploid primary endosperm nucleus undergoes rapid, successive nuclear divisions without cytokinesis, producing a large coenocytic cell (syncytium) containing hundreds to thousands of free nuclei distributed in the cytoplasm along the periphery of the central cell. In Arabidopsis (a model for this developmental pattern), the endosperm remains coenocytic until approximately the torpedo stage of embryo development, when cellularization begins from the micropylar end and progresses toward the chalazal end through a wave-like process involving phragmoplast formation. The timing of cellularization is critical and is regulated by genomic imprinting\u2014specifically, the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb group complex. Cellular endosperm (option B) occurs in some species where each division is followed by wall formation. Helobial endosperm (option C) is intermediate, found in monocots.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fruit development is primarily driven by auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) produced by developing seeds. After fertilization, the developing embryo and endosperm synthesize auxin, which diffuses into the surrounding carpel tissue (pericarp) and stimulates both cell division and cell expansion. The auxin signal from seeds activates the expression of gibberellin biosynthesis genes in the pericarp, and the resulting gibberellins promote fruit enlargement primarily through cell expansion. Evidence supporting this model includes: (1) Seedless mutant fruits are small unless treated with exogenous auxin or gibberellin; (2) Parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit varieties often have mutations that constitutively activate auxin or GA signaling in the pericarp; (3) Application of auxin transport inhibitors to developing fruits blocks fruit growth; (4) In strawberry, selective removal of individual achenes (each containing a seed) creates localized depressions in the receptacle, demonstrating that each seed provides a local auxin source for growth. Ethylene plays a later role in fruit ripening (in climacteric fruits), not in initial fruit development.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Seed dormancy is primarily maintained by a high ratio of abscisic acid (ABA) to gibberellin (GA) in the embryo. ABA promotes and maintains dormancy through multiple mechanisms: (1) ABA induces expression of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins that protect cellular structures during desiccation; (2) ABA activates transcription factors (ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 in Arabidopsis) that suppress germination-related gene expression; (3) ABA inhibits the biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes needed for radicle emergence. During dormancy release (triggered by environmental cues such as cold stratification, light, or after-ripening), ABA levels decrease through catabolism by CYP707A cytochrome P450 enzymes, while GA biosynthesis is activated. GAs promote germination by inducing alpha-amylase and cell wall-loosening enzymes in the endosperm/aleurone layer, weakening the mechanical barrier to radicle emergence. The ABA/GA ratio, rather than the absolute concentration of either hormone, is the key determinant of dormancy status.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The pollen grain wall consists of two main layers: the inner intine (composed of cellulose and pectin, synthesized by the microspore itself) and the outer exine (composed of sporopollenin). Sporopollenin is an extraordinarily resistant biopolymer composed of polymerized fatty acid and phenylpropanoid monomers, making it one of the most chemically inert biological materials known\u2014resistant to acetolysis, strong acids and bases, and most organic solvents. This resistance is why pollen grains are so well-preserved in the fossil record. The exine is primarily synthesized by the tapetum, the innermost anther wall layer. Tapetum cells produce sporopollenin precursors (including fatty acid derivatives processed by enzymes like ACOS5, CYP703A2, CYP704B1, and polyketide synthases PKSA/PKSB) that are secreted into the anther locule and polymerize on the microspore surface.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In sporophytic SI (SSI), pollen compatibility is determined by the diploid sporophytic genotype of the pollen parent, NOT the haploid genotype of the pollen grain itself. This is because the S-locus determinant protein (SCR/SP11) is produced by the diploid tapetum cells and deposited on the pollen coat. When S1 is dominant over S3 in pollen, a plant with genotype S1S3 produces pollen grains that ALL carry S1 SCR protein on their coat, regardless of whether the individual pollen grain carries the S1 or S3 allele. Therefore, an S1S3 female plant (which expresses both SRK1 and SRK3 receptors on its stigma) would reject ALL pollen from any S1S3 father plant\u2014because the S1 coat protein on every pollen grain (even those carrying S3) would activate SRK1 on the stigma. Pollen from S2S4 plants would be accepted because neither S2 nor S4 matches the female's S-haplotypes.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Genomic imprinting in angiosperm endosperm follows predictions of the parental conflict (kinship) theory proposed by Haig and Westoby. In this model: The paternal genome benefits from maximizing resource allocation to its offspring at the potential expense of the mother's future reproductive success (since the father may not father subsequent offspring). Therefore, paternally expressed genes (PEGs) tend to promote endosperm growth, nutrient uptake, and seed size. The maternal genome benefits from distributing resources equitably among all her offspring (current and future). Therefore, maternally expressed genes (MEGs) tend to restrict endosperm growth and limit nutrient allocation to any single seed. This conflict is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, primarily DNA methylation and histone modifications established during gametogenesis. The FIS (Fertilization Independent Seed) Polycomb group complex (containing MEA, FIS2, FIE, MSI1) is a key maternally expressed regulator that restricts endosperm proliferation. Mutations in FIS components lead to endosperm overproliferation.",

(2) Stomium differentiation\u2014a specialized thin-walled zone (the stomium) develops along the junction between the two microsporangia of each theca, representing the predetermined breakage point. (3) Dehydration-driven opening\u2014as the mature anther dehydrates (water loss is accelerated by expression of aquaporin-type channels), the endothecium cells shrink differentially. The rigid fibrous bands in the endothecium resist inward collapse while the outer epidermis contracts, creating mechanical stress that is concentrated at the weak stomium, causing it to rupture. The two halves of each theca peel apart (like a bivalve shell), exposing the pollen grains. The tapetum has already degenerated by this stage and plays no role in dehiscence.",

In cross-compatible (non-self) pollen tubes: multiple SLF (S-locus F-box) proteins, each recognizing a specific non-self S-RNase, function as part of SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that polyubiquitinate non-self S-RNases, targeting them for proteasomal degradation.

      "explanation": "In typical eudicot seeds like soybean (Glycine max), pea, and bean, the endosperm is consumed during seed development, and the storage reserves accumulate in the enlarged cotyledons of the embryo. Soybean seeds contain approximately 40% protein (stored in protein bodies/protein storage vacuoles as glycinin and beta-conglycinin), 20% lipid (stored in oil bodies/oleosomes bounded by oleosin proteins), and modest amounts of starch and other carbohydrates. During germination, these cotyledonary reserves are mobilized by hydrolytic enzymes to fuel seedling growth until the plant becomes photosynthetically self-sufficient. This contrasts with monocot seeds like maize and wheat, where the persistent, starchy endosperm is the major storage tissue, and the cotyledon (scutellum) functions primarily as an absorptive organ that transfers nutrients from endosperm to the growing embryo. In some eudicots like castor bean (Ricinus), the endosperm persists and serves as the primary storage tissue (endospermic seed).

(2) An apical 'clear zone' devoid of large organelles but rich in small secretory vesicles. (3) Exocytosis of secretory vesicles at the extreme tip\u2014these vesicles contain pectin (primarily methyl-esterified homogalacturonan), cell wall matrix materials, and new plasma membrane.

(4) The new wall at the tip is initially soft (pectin-rich), then stiffens behind the tip through de-esterification of pectin by pectin methylesterase (PME) and calcium cross-linking.

In aleurone cells, GA binds to its receptor GID1, triggering degradation of DELLA repressor proteins via the 26S proteasome. This derepresses GA-responsive transcription factors (particularly GAMYB) that activate transcription of hydrolytic enzyme genes, most importantly alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase is synthesized in the rough ER of aleurone cells, secreted into the starchy endosperm, and hydrolyzes starch (amylose and amylopectin) to maltose and glucose. Other hydrolases (proteases, beta-glucanases, nucleases) are also induced. The resulting sugars are absorbed by the scutellum epithelium and transported to the growing embryonic axis (radicle and plumule).

Additionally, a heteromorphic incompatibility system prevents 'illegitimate' pollination (pin x pin or thrum x thrum) through pollen tube rejection in the style.

This receptor-ligand interaction triggers a signaling cascade in the synergid that involves: (1) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NADPH oxidases; (2) Calcium influx into the synergid cell; (3) Synergid cell death and rupture of the synergid cell membrane. The synergid cell rupture creates a physical opening that causes the pollen tube to also burst (pollen tube discharge), releasing the two sperm cells into the embryo sac. In feronia mutants, pollen tubes grow past the synergids without discharging, and multiple pollen tubes may enter the embryo sac (pollen tube overgrowth phenotype). The nta (NORTIA) gene, encoding a protein that relocates to the synergid membrane upon pollen tube contact, is also essential for this process.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The apical-basal axis of the Arabidopsis embryo is established through polar auxin transport mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers. After the first asymmetric division of the zygote produces a small apical cell (future embryo proper) and a large basal cell (future suspensor), PIN7 protein in the suspensor cells directs auxin flow upward into the embryo proper, establishing high auxin levels apically. During the globular-to-heart stage transition, PIN1 expression switches the auxin flow direction\u2014PIN1 in the inner cells of the embryo proper redirects auxin downward toward the basal end, creating an auxin maximum at the position of the future root meristem (hypophysis). This auxin maximum activates the MONOPTEROS/ARF5 transcription factor, which induces root stem cell specification genes. Experimental evidence supporting this model includes: pin7 mutants show disrupted early embryo development; pin1 mutants lack root meristems; auxin response reporter (DR5) confirms the predicted auxin distribution patterns. This PIN-mediated auxin flux is the primary axis-establishing mechanism.",

      "explanation": "Parthenocarpy can be induced by exogenous application of auxin or gibberellin (GA) to unpollinated flowers, mimicking the hormonal signals that developing seeds normally provide. In natural fruit development, seeds produce auxin (IAA) that triggers fruit growth, and auxin subsequently activates GA biosynthesis in the pericarp. By applying these hormones directly to unfertilized ovaries, the seed-derived signal is bypassed: auxin activates cell division and initial fruit growth, while gibberellins promote cell expansion and fruit enlargement. This principle is commercially exploited in agriculture: gibberellic acid (GA3) is applied to Thompson seedless grape clusters to increase berry size; auxin analogs (2,4-D, 4-CPA) are applied to tomatoes and peppers to produce seedless fruit in greenhouses where pollination is limited. Genetic parthenocarpy occurs naturally in some cultivars due to mutations that constitutively activate auxin or GA signaling in the pericarp\u2014for example, parthenocarpic tomato lines carry mutations in SlARF7 or SlDELLA genes.",

These somatic embryos are bipolar structures with both a shoot and root meristem, and they can develop into complete plants. The process is typically induced in tissue culture by manipulating the auxin:cytokinin ratio, often beginning with high auxin (2,4-D) to induce embryogenic callus, followed by auxin withdrawal to trigger embryo differentiation. In contrast, organogenesis produces individual organs (shoots or roots) from callus or explant tissue: high cytokinin:auxin ratio favors shoot organogenesis, while high auxin:cytokinin ratio favors root organogenesis. The key distinction is that somatic embryos are complete bipolar structures (like seeds without seed coats), while organogenesis requires separate shoot and root induction, followed by shoot-root joining.

Some species (hard-seeded legumes) have nearly completely impermeable seed coats that must be scarified for germination; (2) Pathogen defense\u2014tannins, phenolic compounds, and antimicrobial substances in the testa protect against fungal and bacterial invasion; (3) Mechanical protection\u2014the hardened testa shields the embryo from physical damage during dispersal and soil burial; (4) Germination control\u2014seed coat impermeability acts as a dormancy mechanism, regulating when water can imbibe and trigger germination. The seed coat does not photosynthesize, does not contain significant growth hormone stores, and does not repel all microorganisms (beneficial mycorrhizae must eventually interact with the emerging radicle).",

      "explanation": "Ophrys orchids are among the most remarkable examples of pollination by sexual deception. Each Ophrys species typically targets a specific wasp or bee species through an extraordinarily precise mimicry system: (1) Chemical mimicry\u2014the orchid labellum (lip) produces a blend of volatile organic compounds (alkanes, alkenes, esters) that closely matches the species-specific sex pheromone of the target female wasp or bee. These compounds are perceived by the male insect's antennae; (2) Visual mimicry\u2014the labellum color, shape, and pilosity (hairiness) resemble the body of the female insect; (3) Tactile mimicry\u2014the labellum texture and hair patterns provide tactile stimuli similar to the female body. Male wasps or bees, attracted by the chemical and visual cues, land on the labellum and attempt copulation (pseudocopulation). During these movements, the pollinia (pollen masses) are attached to the insect's head or abdomen via the viscidium (sticky disc). When the deceived male visits another Ophrys flower, the pollinia are deposited on the stigma.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Reciprocal crosses using protein-X knockout mutants provide the strongest evidence for guidance function because they distinguish between male and female contributions. If protein X is required for pollen tube guidance: (1) If X functions in the female (pistil): Crossing wild-type pollen onto mutant pistils would show pollen tube guidance defects (tubes failing to reach ovules), while crossing mutant pollen onto wild-type pistils would show normal guidance. This identifies X as a female-expressed guidance cue. (2) If X functions in the male (pollen tube): Crossing mutant pollen onto wild-type pistils would show guidance defects, while the reciprocal cross would be normal. This identifies X as a pollen tube-expressed guidance receptor or response component. (3) If X functions in both: Both cross directions show defects. Additional assays include semi-in-vivo pollen tube guidance assays where excised ovules are placed near pollen tubes growing on agar, and fluorescent protein fusions to determine where protein X localizes.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Polyploidy is classified into two main types based on the origin of the additional chromosome sets: Autopolyploidy results from genome duplication within a single species\u2014for example, if a mitotic error during cell division produces a tetraploid (4n) cell in an otherwise diploid (2n) organism. Autotetraploids have four copies of the same basic chromosome set (AAAA). They may show reduced fertility due to multivalent formation during meiosis (four homologs instead of two, leading to unbalanced segregation), but many autopolyploid species are successful (banana, potato, watermelon). Allopolyploidy results from interspecific hybridization followed by genome duplication. First, two different species (with genomes AA and BB) hybridize to produce a diploid hybrid (AB). This hybrid is typically sterile because the non-homologous chromosomes cannot pair properly during meiosis. However, if the hybrid genome doubles (to AABB), each chromosome now has a homologous partner for meiotic pairing, restoring fertility. Allopolyploidy has been a major mechanism of speciation in angiosperms\u2014bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD, hexaploid) is a classic allopolyploid.",

In Impatiens, the fruit is a capsule with five fused valves under tension. When ripe, even slight touch causes the valves to suddenly coil inward, explosively ejecting seeds several meters from the parent plant. The mechanism involves differential turgor pressure and tissue tensions within the fruit wall\u2014inner cell layers swell while outer layers remain turgid, building elastic potential energy that is released catastrophically when the dehiscence zone weakens. In Ecballium, internal pressure from mucilaginous fluid builds to several atmospheres, and seeds are squirted out when the fruit detaches from the pedicel. Winged samaras are adapted for wind dispersal (anemochory); fleshy drupes are adapted for animal dispersal (endozoochory\u2014birds eat the fruit and disperse seeds in their droppings); hooked burrs are adapted for animal dispersal by external attachment (epizoochory).",

Agrobacterium T-DNA integrates randomly, potentially disrupting important genes. (2) Non-transgenic products\u2014after CRISPR reagents (Cas9 + sgRNA) make the desired edit, the Cas9 transgene can be segregated away through crossing, producing edited but transgene-free plants.

In orchids, pollinia are typically waxy and hard, with all pollen grains cemented together. Each pollinium is connected to a viscidium (a sticky pad) via a stalk called the caudicle (in orchids) or translator (in milkweeds). The complete dispersal unit (pollinium + caudicle/translator + viscidium) is called a pollinarium. When a pollinator (typically a specific bee, wasp, moth, or hummingbird) visits the flower, the viscidium attaches to the pollinator's body, and the entire pollinarium is removed. At the next flower, the pollinia contact the stigmatic surface. This mechanism is highly efficient because: (1) All pollen from one anther is transferred in a single visit, unlike free pollen where only a fraction is transferred; (2) Species specificity is high because pollinia must be placed and removed from precise locations on the pollinator's body; (3) Pollinia reduce pollen waste during transit.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The data reveal important features of the S-RNase rejection mechanism in gametophytic self-incompatibility: (1) Compatible pollen tubes grow through the full style length (5 mm or 25 mm) and reach ovules, indicating normal tube growth when the S-RNase is detoxified by non-self SLF F-box proteins. (2) Self-incompatible tubes grow 3-4 mm before arresting, regardless of total style length. This indicates that S-RNase enters all pollen tubes (compatible and incompatible) non-specifically as they grow through the style. In incompatible tubes, the matching S-RNase is not degraded by SLF proteins and remains active. The cytotoxic effect (degradation of ribosomal RNA and other cellular RNA by the active S-RNase) is cumulative\u2014it takes time for sufficient RNA degradation to halt protein synthesis and kill the pollen tube. The 3-4 mm growth before arrest represents the lag period during which the pollen tube can still grow using pre-existing mRNAs and proteins while the S-RNase progressively degrades new RNA. The arrest does not occur at the stigma surface or at the ovary, confirming that the mechanism acts within the growing pollen tube during stylar transit.",

      "explanation": "Protandry and protogyny are forms of dichogamy\u2014the temporal separation of male and female functions within a hermaphroditic flower to promote outcrossing: Protandry (male-first): Anthers mature, dehisce, and release pollen BEFORE the stigma of the same flower becomes receptive. By the time the stigma is receptive to pollen, the flower's own pollen has already been dispersed to other flowers by pollinators. Examples include many Asteraceae (sunflower family), carrots (Apiaceae), and many legumes. Protogyny (female-first): The stigma becomes receptive and can receive pollen BEFORE the anthers of the same flower mature and release pollen. Early visitors to the flower deposit pollen from other plants onto the receptive stigma. By the time the flower's own pollen is released, the stigma may no longer be receptive. Examples include avocado, magnolia, walnut, and many wind-pollinated trees. Both strategies reduce (but do not eliminate) self-pollination because other flowers on the same plant may be at different stages.

Compatible pollen hydration involves: (1) Initial adhesion\u2014pollen coat lipids and proteins (produced by the tapetum and deposited during pollen maturation) make initial contact with the stigma papilla cell cuticle; (2) Recognition\u2014compatible pollen coat proteins interact with stigmatic receptors, triggering localized breakdown of the papilla cuticle; (3) Water transfer\u2014water flows from the turgid stigmatic papilla cell through the modified cuticle interface to the desiccated pollen grain, allowing it to hydrate, metabolically activate, and germinate. In sporophytic self-incompatibility systems (Brassicaceae), this hydration step is where rejection occurs: when SCR/SP11 on the pollen coat activates SRK on the papilla surface, the downstream ARC1 signaling pathway prevents cuticle modification and water transfer, so self-pollen fails to hydrate.

      "correctAnswer": "C",

This results in larger seeds. From the parental conflict perspective, the paternal genome drives resource acquisition, and extra paternal dosage amplifies this effect. Maternal genome excess (e.g., tetraploid mother x diploid father produces endosperm with 4m:1p ratio): The extra maternal genome causes precocious cellularization, truncating the period of endosperm proliferation and producing smaller seeds. The maternal genome restricts resource allocation, and extra maternal dosage amplifies this restriction.

      "explanation": "Embryo rescue is an in vitro culture technique essential for wide hybridization programs where interspecific or intergeneric crosses produce hybrid embryos that would normally abort. The most common reason for embryo abortion in wide crosses is endosperm failure: when parental species have different ploidy levels or divergent genomes, the endosperm (which receives both maternal and paternal contributions) often develops abnormally due to disrupted genomic imprinting, incompatible gene expression patterns, or dosage imbalances. Without functional endosperm, the hybrid embryo lacks nutritive support and degenerates. In embryo rescue, the developing hybrid embryo is excised from the ovule before it aborts (typically at the globular to early heart stage) and placed on artificial nutrient medium containing sugars, vitamins, amino acids, and growth hormones that substitute for the endosperm. This technique has been crucial for developing important crop varieties, including disease-resistant wheat lines derived from crosses with wild grass relatives, and seedless watermelon production (triploid embryos from 4x x 2x crosses require embryo rescue).",

Many cleistogamous species (like violets, Viola spp.) produce both cleistogamous (CL) flowers and chasmogamous (CH, normal opening) flowers. The CL flowers never open, and self-pollination occurs within the closed bud when pollen directly contacts the stigma. The ecological advantages include: (1) Guaranteed seed set regardless of pollinator availability\u2014critical in environments where pollinators are scarce, unpredictable, or absent (high altitudes, early/late season, dense shade); (2) Reduced energy investment\u2014CL flowers are small and lack petals, nectar, and scent, saving resources compared to CH flowers; (3) Efficient pollen use\u2014no pollen is lost to wind, grooming, or pollen-collecting visitors.

They are physically connected to each other and to the vegetative cell nucleus by a cytoplasmic extension called the male germ unit (MGU). The vegetative cell nucleus typically travels near the tube tip, and the two sperm cells follow closely behind, all transported by the actin-mediated cytoplasmic streaming within the pollen tube. Upon pollen tube burst at the synergid, the two sperm cells are released along with the pollen tube cytoplasm. One sperm fuses with the egg cell and the other with the central cell.

These chimeric genes encode novel proteins that are specifically toxic to the tapetum or developing microspores, causing pollen abortion without affecting female fertility. For example: in maize CMS-T (Texas), the T-urf13 gene encodes a 13 kDa protein that forms pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane, disrupting energy production in tapetum cells. In rice CMS-BT, the orf79 gene produces a cytotoxic protein. CMS is exploited commercially because CMS mothers cannot self-pollinate and must receive pollen from a different line\u2014enabling efficient hybrid seed production without manual emasculation. Fertility is restored by nuclear Restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, most of which encode pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that bind to and degrade or prevent translation of the CMS-causing mitochondrial mRNA, neutralizing the cytotoxic effect.

      "explanation": "Desiccation tolerance in orthodox seeds involves a suite of protective mechanisms, with sugar vitrification being a central component. During late maturation, seeds accumulate high concentrations of non-reducing sugars\u2014primarily sucrose and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs: raffinose, stachyose, verbascose). As water is removed during desiccation, these sugars undergo vitrification\u2014they transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid (glass) state. This glassy matrix has several protective properties: (1) It fills the space vacated by water, preventing mechanical collapse of cellular structures; (2) The extremely high viscosity of the glassy state (approximately 10^12 Pa.s) severely limits molecular mobility, slowing degradative reactions (oxidation, Maillard reactions, hydrolysis) to negligible rates; (3) Sugars can hydrogen-bond with phospholipid head groups, replacing water molecules and maintaining membrane bilayer structure in the dry state (water replacement hypothesis). This sugar glass works synergistically with LEA proteins (which also contribute to vitrification and protein protection) and antioxidant systems. Trehalose is more prominent in resurrection plants and anhydrobiotic organisms, while sucrose and RFOs dominate in orthodox seeds.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Engineered male sterility using tissue-specific cytotoxic gene expression is a powerful biotechnological approach developed by Mariani et al. (1990). The strategy involves: (1) The barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens encodes a ribonuclease that is lethal when expressed in eukaryotic cells because it degrades cellular RNA; (2) The TA29 promoter, isolated from tobacco, drives expression exclusively in the tapetum\u2014the anther cell layer essential for pollen development; (3) When TA29::barnase is expressed in transgenic plants, barnase ribonuclease destroys tapetum cells during early anther development, preventing pollen formation\u2014the plant is male-sterile but otherwise normal; (4) Fertility is restored by crossing with a line expressing barstar (a specific barnase inhibitor) driven by the same TA29 promoter. In the TA29::barnase x TA29::barstar hybrid, barstar neutralizes barnase in the tapetum, allowing normal pollen development. This system has been commercialized in canola (Brassica napus) for hybrid seed production. Chemical gametocides (option A) lack specificity, manual emasculation (option C) is labor-intensive, and darkness (option D) would kill the plant.",

      "explanation": "Pollen allergenicity is caused by soluble proteins released from pollen grains upon contact with moist mucosal surfaces. When pollen grains land in the nasal mucosa, they rapidly hydrate and release proteins from two sources: (1) pollen coat proteins (deposited on the surface by the tapetum during development); and (2) cytoplasmic proteins released when the grain germinates or ruptures. These released proteins include the major pollen allergens\u2014which are often enzymes or structural proteins with normal biological functions in pollen: Bet v 1 (birch, pathogenesis-related protein), Phl p 1 (timothy grass, expansin-like), Der p 1 (mite, cysteine protease), Amb a 1 (ragweed, pectate lyase). In sensitized individuals, these proteins bind to IgE antibodies on mast cells in the nasal mucosa, triggering mast cell degranulation and release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins\u2014causing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever).

      "explanation": "International gene bank standards (established by FAO/IPGRI, now Bioversity International) specify optimal conditions for long-term conservation of orthodox seeds: (1) Moisture content: Seeds are dried to 3-7% moisture content (species-specific optimum), which is below the threshold for enzymatic activity and puts the seed in a glassy state where chemical reactions proceed extremely slowly; (2) Temperature: Base collection storage at -18 to -20 degrees C (conventional cold storage) dramatically reduces the rate of all deteriorative reactions. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault maintains seeds at -18 degrees C in a permafrost-cooled facility; (3) Sealed containers: Hermetically sealed aluminum foil packets or glass jars prevent moisture reabsorption from the environment; (4) Reduced oxygen: Some facilities use vacuum-sealed or nitrogen-flushed containers to reduce oxidative damage. Under these conditions, many orthodox seeds remain viable for decades to centuries. Room temperature storage (option A) dramatically reduces seed longevity.

GCS1/HAP2 was identified through characterization of Arabidopsis mutants where pollen tubes reach the embryo sac and release sperm, but the sperm cells fail to fuse with the egg or central cell. Structural analysis revealed that GCS1/HAP2 is a class II fusion protein with structural homology to viral membrane fusion proteins (such as dengue virus E protein), containing a hydrophobic fusion loop that inserts into the target membrane to drive membrane merger. GCS1/HAP2 is remarkably conserved across eukaryotes\u2014orthologs function in gamete fusion in animals (Chlamydomonas, Plasmodium, C. elegans), suggesting it represents an ancient eukaryotic fertilization mechanism. In plants, GCS1/HAP2 on the sperm surface likely interacts with receptors on the egg cell membrane (candidate egg receptors include EC1 in maize), triggering the conformational changes that drive sperm-egg membrane fusion.",

The three major anthocyanidin aglycones are: pelargonidin (orange-red), cyanidin (red-magenta), and delphinidin (blue-violet), differing in the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring. The final perceived flower color is modified by: (1) Vacuolar pH\u2014anthocyanins are red at acidic pH and blue at basic pH; (2) Co-pigmentation\u2014non-colored flavonoids (flavones, flavonols) stack with anthocyanins to shift color toward blue (bathochromic shift); (3) Metal ion complexation\u2014complexes with Al3+ or Fe3+ shift color to blue (as in Hydrangea, where soil aluminum availability determines flower color); (4) Glycosylation, acylation, and methylation patterns affect stability and color. The flavonoid pathway begins with phenylalanine (via the phenylpropanoid pathway) and progresses through chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Angiosperms have evolved a polyspermy block to ensure that each embryo sac receives sperm from only one pollen tube. After the first pollen tube discharges its two sperm cells into the embryo sac, a mechanism prevents additional pollen tubes from entering. This is crucial because: (1) Additional sperm would cause polyspermy\u2014extra fertilizations would create polyploid embryos or endosperm with disrupted genome balance, leading to developmental failure; (2) In the endosperm, the 2:1 maternal:paternal genome ratio is critical for proper development (as demonstrated by interploidy cross experiments)\u2014extra paternal genomes disrupt genomic imprinting and endosperm cellularization timing; (3) Multiple paternal contributions would create genetic conflicts within the seed. The molecular mechanism involves rapid changes in the synergid/embryo sac after the first pollen tube discharge: ethylene production, modification of LURE peptide secretion, and possibly physical changes that block additional tube entry. In feronia mutants, the polyspermy block fails and multiple pollen tubes enter the embryo sac. The FERONIA pathway thus plays a dual role in both pollen tube reception and polyspermy prevention.",

Without LURE, guidance efficiency drops dramatically but is not zero. (2) FERONIA-mediated pollen tube reception: fer mutants show very low seed set (5%) with a characteristic pollen tube overgrowth phenotype\u2014tubes grow into the embryo sac but fail to stop, burst, and release sperm. This shows FERONIA is required for the pollen tube discharge step downstream of tube arrival. (3) GCS1/HAP2-mediated gamete fusion: gcs1 mutant sperm result in 0% seed set despite normal tube growth and discharge, demonstrating that GCS1/HAP2 is absolutely required for the final membrane fusion event between sperm and egg/central cell.

      "explanation": "Xenia refers to the visible effect of the pollen parent's genotype on the endosperm (or occasionally seed coat/pericarp) characteristics of seeds produced in the current generation. This occurs because the endosperm is a triploid tissue formed by the fusion of two maternal polar nuclei (2n) with one paternal sperm nucleus (n) during double fertilization. Since the paternal genome contributes to endosperm gene expression, any dominant or dosage-dependent paternal alleles affecting endosperm composition can produce visible effects in the current seed. The classic example is in maize (Zea mays): when a yellow-endosperm variety (Y/Y maternal) is pollinated by a purple-endosperm variety carrying the dominant Pr (purple) allele, the resulting endosperm (Y/Y from mother + Pr from father) expresses the paternal Pr allele and appears purple in the current kernel. Without the paternal contribution, the kernel would be yellow. Xenia is distinguished from metaxenia (effects on maternal pericarp/fruit tissue), which involves different mechanisms. Xenia directly demonstrates the genetic contribution of the paternal genome to the triploid endosperm.",

Only the species-specific fig wasp can navigate through the ostiole to reach the flowers. The wasp depends on the fig for reproduction\u2014female wasps enter the syconium, pollinate the flowers, and lay eggs inside short-styled pistillate flowers (gall flowers). Wasp larvae develop inside the fig, feeding on gall flower tissue. Males emerge first, mate with females inside the fig, and chew exit holes. Newly mated females collect pollen from male flowers (which mature last), exit, and seek a receptive fig of the same species to continue the cycle. This mutualism has been maintained for approximately 75-90 million years, with extensive co-speciation events. The other examples represent more generalized pollination relationships.",

In biolistic transformation, DNA-coated gold or tungsten microprojectiles (0.4-1.7 micrometers) are accelerated at high velocity into target cells using compressed gas or gunpowder charge. The microprojectiles penetrate cell walls and membranes, delivering DNA directly into the cytoplasm and nucleus. This method is species-independent and works with any tissue type. Biolistics was used for the first successful transformations of wheat, rice, and maize. However, biolistic transformation has disadvantages: random, often multicopy integration; potential for DNA rearrangement; and higher rates of transgene silencing.

      "explanation": "Seed vigor encompasses the properties that determine the potential for rapid, uniform emergence and development of normal seedlings under a wide range of field conditions. While viability simply indicates whether a seed is alive and capable of germination (a binary measure), vigor describes the physiological quality that determines performance: (1) Speed of germination\u2014vigorous seeds germinate faster, emerging before competitors and avoiding soil pathogens; (2) Uniformity\u2014vigorous seed lots produce even stands with uniform crop maturity; (3) Stress tolerance\u2014vigorous seeds can germinate and establish in suboptimal conditions (cold, wet, compacted soil, pathogen pressure) where low-vigor seeds fail; (4) Seedling growth rate\u2014vigorous seeds produce larger, more competitive seedlings. Seed vigor declines during storage before viability is lost\u2014a seed lot may be 95% viable but have low vigor. Vigor tests include accelerated aging test, cold test, electrical conductivity test, and seedling growth rate assessment. High vigor is critical for commercial agriculture.",

      "explanation": "Each component of the mature Polygonum-type embryo sac has a specific function: (I) Egg cell\u2014the female gamete that fuses with one sperm cell during double fertilization to produce the diploid (2n) zygote, which develops into the embryo of the seed. The egg cell is positioned at the micropylar end of the embryo sac. (II) Synergid cells\u2014two cells flanking the egg at the micropylar end. They have a specialized cell wall structure (filiform apparatus) at their micropylar end that secretes LURE peptides for pollen tube guidance. One synergid degenerates upon pollen tube arrival (facilitating tube reception through FERONIA signaling), and the other may persist briefly after fertilization. (III) Central cell\u2014the largest cell in the embryo sac, containing two polar nuclei (which often fuse before fertilization to form the diploid secondary nucleus). The central cell fuses with the second sperm cell, producing the triploid (3n) primary endosperm nucleus that divides to form the endosperm. (IV) Antipodal cells\u2014three cells at the chalazal end that may have nutritive functions (transferring nutrients from maternal tissue to the embryo sac). In many species (including Arabidopsis), they degenerate early in embryo sac development.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Golden Rice was developed by Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer to address vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which causes blindness and death in millions of children in rice-dependent developing countries. Rice endosperm naturally produces geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a precursor in the isoprenoid pathway, but lacks the downstream enzymes to convert GGPP to beta-carotene. The genetic modification involved introducing two transgenes: (1) Phytoene synthase (PSY)\u2014originally from daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), later replaced with a more active version from maize (Zea mays) in Golden Rice 2\u2014catalyzes the conversion of GGPP to phytoene; (2) Carotene desaturase (CrtI) from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora (Pantoea ananatis)\u2014a single bacterial enzyme that performs the four desaturation and isomerization steps normally requiring two plant enzymes (PDS and ZDS), converting phytoene to lycopene. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by endogenous endosperm enzymes. The resulting transgenic rice produces beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving it a golden color. Golden Rice 2 produces up to 37 micrograms/g carotenoids.",

        "Demethylation in the central cell produces mobile small RNAs that travel to the egg cell to modify embryo development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase plays a critical role in establishing genomic imprinting in angiosperms. DME is expressed specifically in the central cell of the embryo sac (and also in the vegetative cell of the pollen grain), where it actively removes DNA methylation from specific genomic loci through a base excision repair pathway. This demethylation activates maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs) in the central cell, which will continue to be expressed from the maternal alleles in the endosperm after fertilization. Key genes activated by DME-mediated demethylation include: (1) MEA (MEDEA)\u2014a Polycomb group protein that restricts endosperm proliferation; (2) FIS2\u2014another Polycomb component; (3) FWA\u2014an endosperm-specific homeodomain transcription factor. The paternal alleles of these genes remain methylated and silenced in the sperm and subsequently in the endosperm, creating parent-of-origin-specific (imprinted) expression. dme mutant seeds show excessive endosperm proliferation and seed abortion because the maternal MEA/FIS2 alleles are not activated. This epigenetic reprogramming in the central cell is essential for normal endosperm development and represents a key mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants.",

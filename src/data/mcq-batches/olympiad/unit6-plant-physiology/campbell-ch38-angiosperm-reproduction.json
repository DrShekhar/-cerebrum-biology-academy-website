      "question": "In angiosperms, the female gametophyte (embryo sac) typically develops through megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis. What is the fate of the four megaspores produced by meiosis of the megaspore mother cell in the Polygonum-type embryo sac?",
      "options": [
        "All four megaspores undergo mitosis to form a multicellular gametophyte",
        "All four megaspores are released as microspores that develop into pollen grains",

        "Three megaspores degenerate, and the surviving functional megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce an 8-nucleate, 7-celled embryo sac"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the Polygonum-type embryo sac (the most common pattern, found in approximately 70% of angiosperms), the megaspore mother cell (megasporocyte, 2n) undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores arranged in a linear tetrad. Three of these megaspores (typically the three closest to the micropyle) degenerate through programmed cell death. The single surviving functional megaspore (usually the chalazal-most) undergoes three consecutive rounds of mitosis without cytokinesis, producing an 8-nucleate coenocyte. Subsequent cellularization creates the 7-celled embryo sac: 3 antipodal cells at the chalazal end, 2 synergids flanking the egg cell at the micropylar end, the egg cell itself, and the large central cell containing 2 polar nuclei. The synergids play crucial roles in pollen tube guidance through secretion of attractant peptides (LURE proteins), and the central cell's polar nuclei will fuse with one sperm during double fertilization to form the triploid endosperm.",

      "options": [
        "One sperm fuses with the egg (producing a 2n zygote) and one sperm fuses with one synergid (producing a 2n accessory embryo)",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Double fertilization involves two simultaneous fertilization events within the embryo sac. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell (n), producing a diploid (2n) zygote that develops into the embryo. The second sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei (each n) in the central cell, producing a triploid (3n) primary endosperm nucleus that develops into the endosperm—the nutritive tissue that supports embryo development and, in many species, provides nutrition for the germinating seedling. This process is unique to angiosperms (and Ephedra among gymnosperms, though with different outcomes). The triploid endosperm is genetically 2:1 maternal to paternal, which has implications for genomic imprinting. Double fertilization ensures that endosperm develops only when fertilization occurs, preventing wasteful investment in nutritive tissue without a viable embryo. The synergids facilitate pollen tube reception and burst, and the antipodal cells may have nutritive functions but are not fertilized.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI) of Brassicaceae, compatibility is determined by the diploid S-genotype of the pollen-producing parent (sporophyte), not the haploid genotype of the pollen grain itself. This occurs because the pollen coat proteins responsible for the SI response are synthesized by the diploid tapetum cells (which line the anther locule) and deposited onto the pollen grain surface during pollen maturation. The key male determinant is SCR/SP11 (S-locus Cysteine-Rich protein), a small cysteine-rich peptide encoded at the S-locus that is expressed in the tapetum and deposited on the pollen coat. On the stigma surface, the female determinant is the SRK (S-locus Receptor Kinase), a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase. When SCR from the pollen coat matches the SRK on the stigma (i.e., they share the same S-haplotype), SRK is activated, triggering a signaling cascade through ARC1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) that leads to rejection of the pollen.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pollen tube guidance occurs in multiple stages with different molecular mechanisms. The final, short-range attraction of the pollen tube to the micropyle of the ovule is mediated by LURE peptides—small, secreted defensin-like cysteine-rich polypeptides (CRPs) produced specifically by the synergid cells of the embryo sac. In Torenia fournieri, where the embryo sac protrudes from the ovule allowing direct observation, LURE1 and LURE2 were identified as the attractants. In Arabidopsis, AtLURE1 peptides serve the same function. These peptides are secreted from the synergid cells through the filiform apparatus (specialized cell wall invaginations at the micropylar end of synergids) and diffuse toward the micropyle, creating a concentration gradient that guides the pollen tube tip. The pollen tube perceives LURE through receptor kinases on its tip membrane (PRK6 in Arabidopsis). Earlier stages of pollen tube guidance involve TTS (Transmitting Tissue-Specific) glycoproteins and AGPs in the style, but these provide funicular guidance, not the final micropylar targeting.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ABC model, proposed by Coen and Meyerowitz (1991), explains floral organ identity through combinatorial expression of three classes of homeotic genes across four concentric whorls: Whorl 1 (outermost): A function alone specifies sepals; Whorl 2: A + B functions together specify petals; Whorl 3: B + C functions together specify stamens; Whorl 4 (innermost): C function alone specifies carpels. In Arabidopsis, A-function genes include APETALA1 (AP1) and APETALA2 (AP2); B-function genes include APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI); C-function gene is AGAMOUS (AG). The model predicts that loss of A function causes C to expand into whorls 1-2, converting sepals to carpels and petals to stamens. Loss of B converts petals to sepals and stamens to carpels. Loss of C converts stamens to petals and carpels to sepals. The model has been extended to ABCDE, with D-function genes specifying ovule identity and E-function (SEPALLATA) genes required as co-factors for all organ identities.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Gametophytic apomixis involves the formation of an unreduced (2n) embryo sac that develops into a seed without fertilization. There are two main pathways: (1) Diplospory—the megaspore mother cell itself bypasses or modifies meiosis (either skipping meiosis entirely or undergoing a modified meiosis that restores the diploid chromosome number through restitution), producing an unreduced embryo sac; (2) Apospory—a somatic nucellar cell adjacent to the megaspore mother cell develops directly into an unreduced embryo sac without meiosis, often displacing the normal meiotically-derived embryo sac. In both cases, the unreduced egg cell within the embryo sac develops parthenogenetically into a 2n embryo without fertilization, producing offspring that are genetically identical to the mother plant. Endosperm development may still require fertilization (pseudogamous apomixis) or may develop autonomously. This contrasts with adventitious embryony (option A), which is sporophytic apomixis.",

        "The tapetum secretes enzymes that degrade the callose wall surrounding microspore tetrads simultaneously with meiosis completion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The tapetum is the innermost cell layer of the anther wall that surrounds developing microspores and plays indispensable roles in pollen development. Its primary functions include: (1) Providing nutrients (sugars, amino acids, lipids) to the avascular developing microspores; (2) Synthesizing and secreting sporopollenin precursors—the extremely resistant biopolymer that forms the outer exine wall of pollen grains. Sporopollenin is one of the most chemically resistant biological polymers known; (3) Depositing pollen coat (tryphine/pollenkitt) materials including lipids, proteins, flavonoids, and (in SSI species) SCR/SP11 compatibility determinants; (4) Producing callase (beta-1,3-glucanase) that dissolves the callose wall surrounding microspore tetrads, releasing individual microspores. The tapetum typically undergoes programmed cell death (PCD) during the later stages of pollen development, releasing its cellular contents into the anther locule for incorporation into pollen walls and coats. Tapetum dysfunction (e.g., in male-sterile mutants) results in defective pollen development.",

        "Nuclear endosperm development, found in Arabidopsis and most eudicots, where the primary endosperm nucleus divides repeatedly without cytokinesis before eventual cellularization",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Nuclear endosperm development is the most common pattern among angiosperms, particularly in eudicots. After double fertilization, the triploid primary endosperm nucleus undergoes rapid, successive nuclear divisions without cytokinesis, producing a large coenocytic cell (syncytium) containing hundreds to thousands of free nuclei distributed in the cytoplasm along the periphery of the central cell. In Arabidopsis (a model for this developmental pattern), the endosperm remains coenocytic until approximately the torpedo stage of embryo development, when cellularization begins from the micropylar end and progresses toward the chalazal end through a wave-like process involving phragmoplast formation. The timing of cellularization is critical and is regulated by genomic imprinting—specifically, the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) Polycomb group complex. Cellular endosperm (option B) occurs in some species where each division is followed by wall formation. Helobial endosperm (option C) is intermediate, found in monocots. Ruminate endosperm (option D) describes a surface texture, not a developmental type.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Fruit development is primarily driven by auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) produced by developing seeds. After fertilization, the developing embryo and endosperm synthesize auxin, which diffuses into the surrounding carpel tissue (pericarp) and stimulates both cell division and cell expansion. The auxin signal from seeds activates the expression of gibberellin biosynthesis genes in the pericarp, and the resulting gibberellins promote fruit enlargement primarily through cell expansion. Evidence supporting this model includes: (1) Seedless mutant fruits are small unless treated with exogenous auxin or gibberellin; (2) Parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit varieties often have mutations that constitutively activate auxin or GA signaling in the pericarp; (3) Application of auxin transport inhibitors to developing fruits blocks fruit growth; (4) In strawberry, selective removal of individual achenes (each containing a seed) creates localized depressions in the receptacle, demonstrating that each seed provides a local auxin source for growth. Ethylene plays a later role in fruit ripening (in climacteric fruits), not in initial fruit development.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Seed dormancy is primarily maintained by a high ratio of abscisic acid (ABA) to gibberellin (GA) in the embryo. ABA promotes and maintains dormancy through multiple mechanisms: (1) ABA induces expression of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins that protect cellular structures during desiccation; (2) ABA activates transcription factors (ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 in Arabidopsis) that suppress germination-related gene expression; (3) ABA inhibits the biosynthesis of cell wall-degrading enzymes needed for radicle emergence. During dormancy release (triggered by environmental cues such as cold stratification, light, or after-ripening), ABA levels decrease through catabolism by CYP707A cytochrome P450 enzymes, while GA biosynthesis is activated. GAs promote germination by inducing alpha-amylase and cell wall-loosening enzymes in the endosperm/aleurone layer, weakening the mechanical barrier to radicle emergence. The ABA/GA ratio, rather than the absolute concentration of either hormone, is the key determinant of dormancy status.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The pollen grain wall consists of two main layers: the inner intine (composed of cellulose and pectin, synthesized by the microspore itself) and the outer exine (composed of sporopollenin). Sporopollenin is an extraordinarily resistant biopolymer composed of polymerized fatty acid and phenylpropanoid monomers, making it one of the most chemically inert biological materials known—resistant to acetolysis, strong acids and bases, and most organic solvents. This resistance is why pollen grains are so well-preserved in the fossil record. The exine is primarily synthesized by the tapetum, the innermost anther wall layer. Tapetum cells produce sporopollenin precursors (including fatty acid derivatives processed by enzymes like ACOS5, CYP703A2, CYP704B1, and polyketide synthases PKSA/PKSB) that are secreted into the anther locule and polymerize on the microspore surface.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In sporophytic SI (SSI), pollen compatibility is determined by the diploid sporophytic genotype of the pollen parent, NOT the haploid genotype of the pollen grain itself. This is because the S-locus determinant protein (SCR/SP11) is produced by the diploid tapetum cells and deposited on the pollen coat. When S1 is dominant over S3 in pollen, a plant with genotype S1S3 produces pollen grains that ALL carry S1 SCR protein on their coat, regardless of whether the individual pollen grain carries the S1 or S3 allele. Therefore, an S1S3 female plant (which expresses both SRK1 and SRK3 receptors on its stigma) would reject ALL pollen from any S1S3 father plant—because the S1 coat protein on every pollen grain (even those carrying S3) would activate SRK1 on the stigma. Pollen from S2S4 plants would be accepted because neither S2 nor S4 matches the female's S-haplotypes. Dominance relationships in SSI are thus critical for determining cross-compatibility in breeding programs.",

      "explanation": "Genomic imprinting in angiosperm endosperm follows predictions of the parental conflict (kinship) theory proposed by Haig and Westoby. In this model: The paternal genome benefits from maximizing resource allocation to its offspring at the potential expense of the mother's future reproductive success (since the father may not father subsequent offspring). Therefore, paternally expressed genes (PEGs) tend to promote endosperm growth, nutrient uptake, and seed size. The maternal genome benefits from distributing resources equitably among all her offspring (current and future). Therefore, maternally expressed genes (MEGs) tend to restrict endosperm growth and limit nutrient allocation to any single seed. This conflict is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, primarily DNA methylation and histone modifications established during gametogenesis. The FIS (Fertilization Independent Seed) Polycomb group complex (containing MEA, FIS2, FIE, MSI1) is a key maternally expressed regulator that restricts endosperm proliferation. Mutations in FIS components lead to endosperm overproliferation.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Anther dehiscence is a precisely regulated biomechanical process that involves: (1) Endothecium development—the endothecium, the sub-epidermal layer of the anther wall, develops characteristic secondary cell wall thickenings (fibrous bands or U-shaped thickenings) composed of cellulose and lignin during late anther development. (2) Stomium differentiation—a specialized thin-walled zone (the stomium) develops along the junction between the two microsporangia of each theca, representing the predetermined breakage point. (3) Dehydration-driven opening—as the mature anther dehydrates (water loss is accelerated by expression of aquaporin-type channels), the endothecium cells shrink differentially. The rigid fibrous bands in the endothecium resist inward collapse while the outer epidermis contracts, creating mechanical stress that is concentrated at the weak stomium, causing it to rupture. The two halves of each theca peel apart (like a bivalve shell), exposing the pollen grains. The tapetum has already degenerated by this stage and plays no role in dehiscence.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system of Solanaceae (and Rosaceae, Plantaginaceae), the female determinant is S-RNase, a glycoprotein ribonuclease secreted into the extracellular matrix of the style transmitting tissue. S-RNases are taken up non-specifically into all growing pollen tubes, regardless of S-genotype. Inside the pollen tube, the fate of the S-RNase determines compatibility: In self (incompatible) pollen tubes: the S-RNase with matching S-specificity is NOT degraded and remains active, proceeding to degrade ribosomal RNA and other cellular RNA, killing the pollen tube by halting protein synthesis and disrupting cellular function. In cross-compatible (non-self) pollen tubes: multiple SLF (S-locus F-box) proteins, each recognizing a specific non-self S-RNase, function as part of SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that polyubiquitinate non-self S-RNases, targeting them for proteasomal degradation.

      "explanation": "In typical eudicot seeds like soybean (Glycine max), pea, and bean, the endosperm is consumed during seed development, and the storage reserves accumulate in the enlarged cotyledons of the embryo. Soybean seeds contain approximately 40% protein (stored in protein bodies/protein storage vacuoles as glycinin and beta-conglycinin), 20% lipid (stored in oil bodies/oleosomes bounded by oleosin proteins), and modest amounts of starch and other carbohydrates. During germination, these cotyledonary reserves are mobilized by hydrolytic enzymes to fuel seedling growth until the plant becomes photosynthetically self-sufficient. This contrasts with monocot seeds like maize and wheat, where the persistent, starchy endosperm is the major storage tissue, and the cotyledon (scutellum) functions primarily as an absorptive organ that transfers nutrients from endosperm to the growing embryo. In some eudicots like castor bean (Ricinus), the endosperm persists and serves as the primary storage tissue (endospermic seed).

      "explanation": "Pollen tube tip growth is driven by a highly organized vesicle trafficking system powered by the actin cytoskeleton. The process involves: (1) Cytoplasmic streaming in a 'reverse fountain' pattern—long actin filament bundles in the pollen tube shank drive organelles and vesicles toward the tip along the tube periphery, while material flows backward through the center. (2) An apical 'clear zone' devoid of large organelles but rich in small secretory vesicles. (3) Exocytosis of secretory vesicles at the extreme tip—these vesicles contain pectin (primarily methyl-esterified homogalacturonan), cell wall matrix materials, and new plasma membrane. Vesicle fusion with the apical plasma membrane simultaneously extends the membrane surface area and deposits wall materials externally. (4) The new wall at the tip is initially soft (pectin-rich), then stiffens behind the tip through de-esterification of pectin by pectin methylesterase (PME) and calcium cross-linking. (5) This process is regulated by a tip-focused calcium gradient, ROP GTPases (ROP1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphoinositide signaling.

The microspore divides unequally to produce: (1) A large vegetative cell with diffuse chromatin and most of the cytoplasm—this cell will not divide again but will grow to form the pollen tube after germination on the stigma. The vegetative cell nucleus directs pollen tube growth and metabolism. (2) A small generative cell with condensed chromatin and minimal cytoplasm, initially enclosed within the vegetative cell. The generative cell will undergo one more mitotic division (pollen mitosis II) to produce the two sperm cells needed for double fertilization. This asymmetric division is critical because it establishes different chromatin states and gene expression programs in the two cell types. The vegetative cell expresses genes for tube growth, wall synthesis, and signaling, while the generative cell expresses genes related to cell cycle progression and sperm cell specification.",

In a simple fruit, the edible or functional portions develop entirely from the ovary wall (pericarp = mature carpel wall). In an accessory fruit, tissues other than the ovary wall—such as the receptacle, hypanthium (floral tube), sepals, or other floral parts—contribute substantially to the fruit. Classic examples include: Apple (Malus)—the fleshy part is the enlarged hypanthium; the actual fruit (developed from the ovary) is the core containing the seeds. Strawberry (Fragaria)—the fleshy red portion is the enlarged receptacle; the actual fruits are the small achenes (dry one-seeded fruits) embedded on the surface. Pineapple is a multiple accessory fruit where the fleshy tissue derives from the fused receptacles and floral parts of many flowers in an inflorescence. Simple fruits can be either fleshy (berries, drupes) or dry (capsules, achenes, caryopses).",

      "explanation": "The suspensor is a transient embryonic structure that connects the embryo proper to the maternal tissue of the ovule. It serves several critical functions during early embryogenesis: (1) Physical positioning—the suspensor pushes the embryo proper into the nutrient-rich endosperm, ensuring optimal access to nutritive resources; (2) Nutrient transport—the suspensor acts as a conduit for transferring nutrients and signaling molecules from the maternal seed coat and endosperm to the developing embryo. Transfer cells in the suspensor have wall ingrowths that increase surface area for nutrient absorption; (3) Hormone production—the suspensor synthesizes and transports hormones, particularly auxin and gibberellins, to the embryo proper. Auxin transport through the suspensor establishes the apical-basal axis of the embryo; (4) In Arabidopsis, the suspensor consists of 6-9 cells and undergoes programmed cell death as the embryo matures.

While vegetative reproduction offers advantages—rapid population expansion, preservation of successful genotypes, reproduction without pollinators—it produces genetically uniform populations that lack the genetic diversity generated by meiosis and recombination during sexual reproduction. This genetic uniformity makes clonal populations vulnerable to environmental changes, new pathogens, and parasites (as exemplified by the Irish potato famine, where clonally propagated potato varieties were devastated by Phytophthora infestans). Vegetative reproduction occurs across plant groups (ferns reproduce via rhizome fragmentation, mosses via gemmae), does not require pollination, and always produces less genetic diversity than sexual reproduction.",

      "explanation": "In cereal grains (wheat, barley, rice), the germination signaling cascade begins with water imbibition, which activates the embryo. The embryo (specifically the scutellum) synthesizes gibberellins (GA3, GA1) which diffuse to the aleurone layer—a specialized protein-rich cell layer surrounding the starchy endosperm. In aleurone cells, GA binds to its receptor GID1, triggering degradation of DELLA repressor proteins via the 26S proteasome. This derepresses GA-responsive transcription factors (particularly GAMYB) that activate transcription of hydrolytic enzyme genes, most importantly alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase is synthesized in the rough ER of aleurone cells, secreted into the starchy endosperm, and hydrolyzes starch (amylose and amylopectin) to maltose and glucose. Other hydrolases (proteases, beta-glucanases, nucleases) are also induced. The resulting sugars are absorbed by the scutellum epithelium and transported to the growing embryonic axis (radicle and plumule).

They produce smaller, more numerous pollen grains. Thrum flowers have short styles with the stigma positioned low in the tube and long stamens positioned at the tube opening. They produce larger, fewer pollen grains. This reciprocal arrangement (reciprocal herkogamy) promotes cross-pollination between morphs by pollinators: an insect visiting a pin flower picks up pollen from the low anthers on a body part that contacts the low stigma of a thrum flower, and vice versa. Additionally, a heteromorphic incompatibility system prevents 'illegitimate' pollination (pin x pin or thrum x thrum) through pollen tube rejection in the style. The S-locus supergene contains linked genes controlling style length, stamen height, pollen size, and incompatibility. Tristylous species (like Lythrum) have three morphs.",

When the pollen tube arrives at the micropyle, FER on the synergid recognizes RALF (Rapid Alkalinization Factor) peptides presented by the pollen tube. This receptor-ligand interaction triggers a signaling cascade in the synergid that involves: (1) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NADPH oxidases; (2) Calcium influx into the synergid cell; (3) Synergid cell death and rupture of the synergid cell membrane. The synergid cell rupture creates a physical opening that causes the pollen tube to also burst (pollen tube discharge), releasing the two sperm cells into the embryo sac. In feronia mutants, pollen tubes grow past the synergids without discharging, and multiple pollen tubes may enter the embryo sac (pollen tube overgrowth phenotype).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The apical-basal axis of the Arabidopsis embryo is established through polar auxin transport mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers. After the first asymmetric division of the zygote produces a small apical cell (future embryo proper) and a large basal cell (future suspensor), PIN7 protein in the suspensor cells directs auxin flow upward into the embryo proper, establishing high auxin levels apically. During the globular-to-heart stage transition, PIN1 expression switches the auxin flow direction—PIN1 in the inner cells of the embryo proper redirects auxin downward toward the basal end, creating an auxin maximum at the position of the future root meristem (hypophysis). This auxin maximum activates the MONOPTEROS/ARF5 transcription factor, which induces root stem cell specification genes. Experimental evidence supporting this model includes: pin7 mutants show disrupted early embryo development; pin1 mutants lack root meristems; auxin response reporter (DR5) confirms the predicted auxin distribution patterns. This PIN-mediated auxin flux is the primary axis-establishing mechanism.",

      "explanation": "Parthenocarpy can be induced by exogenous application of auxin or gibberellin (GA) to unpollinated flowers, mimicking the hormonal signals that developing seeds normally provide. In natural fruit development, seeds produce auxin (IAA) that triggers fruit growth, and auxin subsequently activates GA biosynthesis in the pericarp. By applying these hormones directly to unfertilized ovaries, the seed-derived signal is bypassed: auxin activates cell division and initial fruit growth, while gibberellins promote cell expansion and fruit enlargement. This principle is commercially exploited in agriculture: gibberellic acid (GA3) is applied to Thompson seedless grape clusters to increase berry size; auxin analogs (2,4-D, 4-CPA) are applied to tomatoes and peppers to produce seedless fruit in greenhouses where pollination is limited. Genetic parthenocarpy occurs naturally in some cultivars due to mutations that constitutively activate auxin or GA signaling in the pericarp—for example, parthenocarpic tomato lines carry mutations in SlARF7 or SlDELLA genes.",

      "explanation": "Somatic embryogenesis is the process by which somatic (non-reproductive) cells develop into embryos through a pathway that recapitulates the stages of zygotic embryogenesis—globular, heart, torpedo, and cotyledonary stages—without fertilization. These somatic embryos are bipolar structures with both a shoot and root meristem, and they can develop into complete plants. The process is typically induced in tissue culture by manipulating the auxin:cytokinin ratio, often beginning with high auxin (2,4-D) to induce embryogenic callus, followed by auxin withdrawal to trigger embryo differentiation. In contrast, organogenesis produces individual organs (shoots or roots) from callus or explant tissue: high cytokinin:auxin ratio favors shoot organogenesis, while high auxin:cytokinin ratio favors root organogenesis. The key distinction is that somatic embryos are complete bipolar structures (like seeds without seed coats), while organogenesis requires separate shoot and root induction, followed by shoot-root joining. Somatic embryogenesis works in both monocots and dicots and produces diploid plants from diploid cells.",

Its properties include: (1) Physical impermeability—the testa contains layers of thick-walled, lignified, or suberized cells (often palisade-like macrosclereids in the outer layer) that restrict water and gas exchange, preventing premature germination and protecting against desiccation. Some species (hard-seeded legumes) have nearly completely impermeable seed coats that must be scarified for germination; (2) Pathogen defense—tannins, phenolic compounds, and antimicrobial substances in the testa protect against fungal and bacterial invasion; (3) Mechanical protection—the hardened testa shields the embryo from physical damage during dispersal and soil burial; (4) Germination control—seed coat impermeability acts as a dormancy mechanism, regulating when water can imbibe and trigger germination. The seed coat does not photosynthesize, does not contain significant growth hormone stores, and does not repel all microorganisms (beneficial mycorrhizae must eventually interact with the emerging radicle).",

      "explanation": "Ophrys orchids are among the most remarkable examples of pollination by sexual deception. Each Ophrys species typically targets a specific wasp or bee species through an extraordinarily precise mimicry system: (1) Chemical mimicry—the orchid labellum (lip) produces a blend of volatile organic compounds (alkanes, alkenes, esters) that closely matches the species-specific sex pheromone of the target female wasp or bee. These compounds are perceived by the male insect's antennae; (2) Visual mimicry—the labellum color, shape, and pilosity (hairiness) resemble the body of the female insect; (3) Tactile mimicry—the labellum texture and hair patterns provide tactile stimuli similar to the female body. Male wasps or bees, attracted by the chemical and visual cues, land on the labellum and attempt copulation (pseudocopulation). During these movements, the pollinia (pollen masses) are attached to the insect's head or abdomen via the viscidium (sticky disc). When the deceived male visits another Ophrys flower, the pollinia are deposited on the stigma. This highly species-specific pollination mechanism drives reproductive isolation and speciation in Ophrys.",

      "explanation": "Reciprocal crosses using protein-X knockout mutants provide the strongest evidence for guidance function because they distinguish between male and female contributions. If protein X is required for pollen tube guidance: (1) If X functions in the female (pistil): Crossing wild-type pollen onto mutant pistils would show pollen tube guidance defects (tubes failing to reach ovules), while crossing mutant pollen onto wild-type pistils would show normal guidance. This identifies X as a female-expressed guidance cue. (2) If X functions in the male (pollen tube): Crossing mutant pollen onto wild-type pistils would show guidance defects, while the reciprocal cross would be normal. This identifies X as a pollen tube-expressed guidance receptor or response component. (3) If X functions in both: Both cross directions show defects. Additional assays include semi-in-vivo pollen tube guidance assays where excised ovules are placed near pollen tubes growing on agar, and fluorescent protein fusions to determine where protein X localizes.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Polyploidy is classified into two main types based on the origin of the additional chromosome sets: Autopolyploidy results from genome duplication within a single species—for example, if a mitotic error during cell division produces a tetraploid (4n) cell in an otherwise diploid (2n) organism. Autotetraploids have four copies of the same basic chromosome set (AAAA). They may show reduced fertility due to multivalent formation during meiosis (four homologs instead of two, leading to unbalanced segregation), but many autopolyploid species are successful (banana, potato, watermelon). Allopolyploidy results from interspecific hybridization followed by genome duplication. First, two different species (with genomes AA and BB) hybridize to produce a diploid hybrid (AB). This hybrid is typically sterile because the non-homologous chromosomes cannot pair properly during meiosis. However, if the hybrid genome doubles (to AABB), each chromosome now has a homologous partner for meiotic pairing, restoring fertility. Allopolyploidy has been a major mechanism of speciation in angiosperms—bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD, hexaploid) is a classic allopolyploid.",

The molecular mechanism involves: (1) In leaves exposed to inductive photoperiod, the circadian clock and photoreceptors activate CONSTANS (CO) transcription factor, which induces FT gene expression; (2) FT protein (a small phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) is loaded into phloem companion cells and transported via sieve elements to the shoot apical meristem; (3) At the meristem, FT protein enters cells and interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FD, forming an FT-FD complex; (4) This complex activates expression of floral meristem identity genes, particularly APETALA1 (AP1) and LEAFY (LFY), which irreversibly convert the vegetative meristem to a floral meristem; (5) LFY and AP1 then activate the ABC(DE) floral organ identity genes.

      "explanation": "Explosive or ballistic seed dispersal (autochory) occurs in species like Impatiens (touch-me-not), Ecballium elaterium (squirting cucumber), and many legumes. In Impatiens, the fruit is a capsule with five fused valves under tension. When ripe, even slight touch causes the valves to suddenly coil inward, explosively ejecting seeds several meters from the parent plant. The mechanism involves differential turgor pressure and tissue tensions within the fruit wall—inner cell layers swell while outer layers remain turgid, building elastic potential energy that is released catastrophically when the dehiscence zone weakens. In Ecballium, internal pressure from mucilaginous fluid builds to several atmospheres, and seeds are squirted out when the fruit detaches from the pedicel. Winged samaras are adapted for wind dispersal (anemochory); fleshy drupes are adapted for animal dispersal (endozoochory—birds eat the fruit and disperse seeds in their droppings); hooked burrs are adapted for animal dispersal by external attachment (epizoochory).",

Agrobacterium T-DNA integrates randomly, potentially disrupting important genes. (2) Non-transgenic products—after CRISPR reagents (Cas9 + sgRNA) make the desired edit, the Cas9 transgene can be segregated away through crossing, producing edited but transgene-free plants. This is particularly important for regulatory purposes, as some jurisdictions (e.g., Japan, USA for certain modifications) exempt gene-edited crops without foreign DNA from GMO regulations. (3) Multiplexing—multiple guide RNAs can simultaneously target several genes.

In orchids, pollinia are typically waxy and hard, with all pollen grains cemented together. Each pollinium is connected to a viscidium (a sticky pad) via a stalk called the caudicle (in orchids) or translator (in milkweeds). The complete dispersal unit (pollinium + caudicle/translator + viscidium) is called a pollinarium. When a pollinator (typically a specific bee, wasp, moth, or hummingbird) visits the flower, the viscidium attaches to the pollinator's body, and the entire pollinarium is removed. At the next flower, the pollinia contact the stigmatic surface. This mechanism is highly efficient because: (1) All pollen from one anther is transferred in a single visit, unlike free pollen where only a fraction is transferred; (2) Species specificity is high because pollinia must be placed and removed from precise locations on the pollinator's body; (3) Pollinia reduce pollen waste during transit.",

      "explanation": "The data reveal important features of the S-RNase rejection mechanism in gametophytic self-incompatibility: (1) Compatible pollen tubes grow through the full style length (5 mm or 25 mm) and reach ovules, indicating normal tube growth when the S-RNase is detoxified by non-self SLF F-box proteins. (2) Self-incompatible tubes grow 3-4 mm before arresting, regardless of total style length. This indicates that S-RNase enters all pollen tubes (compatible and incompatible) non-specifically as they grow through the style. In incompatible tubes, the matching S-RNase is not degraded by SLF proteins and remains active. The cytotoxic effect (degradation of ribosomal RNA and other cellular RNA by the active S-RNase) is cumulative—it takes time for sufficient RNA degradation to halt protein synthesis and kill the pollen tube. The 3-4 mm growth before arrest represents the lag period during which the pollen tube can still grow using pre-existing mRNAs and proteins while the S-RNase progressively degrades new RNA. The arrest does not occur at the stigma surface or at the ovary, confirming that the mechanism acts within the growing pollen tube during stylar transit.",

      "options": [
        "Protandry means stamens and pistils develop on separate plants, while protogyny means both are on the same plant",
        "Protandry occurs in monocots only, while protogyny occurs in dicots only",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Protandry and protogyny are forms of dichogamy—the temporal separation of male and female functions within a hermaphroditic flower to promote outcrossing: Protandry (male-first): Anthers mature, dehisce, and release pollen BEFORE the stigma of the same flower becomes receptive. By the time the stigma is receptive to pollen, the flower's own pollen has already been dispersed to other flowers by pollinators. Examples include many Asteraceae (sunflower family), carrots (Apiaceae), and many legumes. Protogyny (female-first): The stigma becomes receptive and can receive pollen BEFORE the anthers of the same flower mature and release pollen. Early visitors to the flower deposit pollen from other plants onto the receptive stigma. By the time the flower's own pollen is released, the stigma may no longer be receptive. Examples include avocado, magnolia, walnut, and many wind-pollinated trees. Both strategies reduce (but do not eliminate) self-pollination because other flowers on the same plant may be at different stages. These are distinct from dioecy (separate male and female plants) and spatial separation mechanisms.",

      "explanation": "In dry-stigma species (where the stigma surface lacks a fluid exudate), pollen hydration is a regulated, selective process that serves as the first checkpoint in pollen-pistil compatibility. Compatible pollen hydration involves: (1) Initial adhesion—pollen coat lipids and proteins (produced by the tapetum and deposited during pollen maturation) make initial contact with the stigma papilla cell cuticle; (2) Recognition—compatible pollen coat proteins interact with stigmatic receptors, triggering localized breakdown of the papilla cuticle; (3) Water transfer—water flows from the turgid stigmatic papilla cell through the modified cuticle interface to the desiccated pollen grain, allowing it to hydrate, metabolically activate, and germinate. In sporophytic self-incompatibility systems (Brassicaceae), this hydration step is where rejection occurs: when SCR/SP11 on the pollen coat activates SRK on the papilla surface, the downstream ARC1 signaling pathway prevents cuticle modification and water transfer, so self-pollen fails to hydrate. Pollen from unrelated species also fails to hydrate due to biochemical incompatibility at the lipid-cuticle interface.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Interploidy crosses that disrupt the normal 2m:1p (2 maternal : 1 paternal) genome ratio in endosperm produce predictable developmental abnormalities consistent with the parental conflict theory: Paternal genome excess (e.g., diploid mother x tetraploid father produces endosperm with 2m:2p ratio): The extra paternal genome delays endosperm cellularization, leading to an extended period of free-nuclear division and potentially larger endosperm with more storage reserves. This results in larger seeds. From the parental conflict perspective, the paternal genome drives resource acquisition, and extra paternal dosage amplifies this effect. Maternal genome excess (e.g., tetraploid mother x diploid father produces endosperm with 4m:1p ratio): The extra maternal genome causes precocious cellularization, truncating the period of endosperm proliferation and producing smaller seeds. The maternal genome restricts resource allocation, and extra maternal dosage amplifies this restriction.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Embryo rescue is an in vitro culture technique essential for wide hybridization programs where interspecific or intergeneric crosses produce hybrid embryos that would normally abort. The most common reason for embryo abortion in wide crosses is endosperm failure: when parental species have different ploidy levels or divergent genomes, the endosperm (which receives both maternal and paternal contributions) often develops abnormally due to disrupted genomic imprinting, incompatible gene expression patterns, or dosage imbalances. Without functional endosperm, the hybrid embryo lacks nutritive support and degenerates. In embryo rescue, the developing hybrid embryo is excised from the ovule before it aborts (typically at the globular to early heart stage) and placed on artificial nutrient medium containing sugars, vitamins, amino acids, and growth hormones that substitute for the endosperm. This technique has been crucial for developing important crop varieties, including disease-resistant wheat lines derived from crosses with wild grass relatives, and seedless watermelon production (triploid embryos from 4x x 2x crosses require embryo rescue).",

      "explanation": "The tetrazolium (TZ) test is the fastest standard method for assessing seed viability, providing results within 24 hours compared to weeks for germination tests. The principle: (1) Seeds are soaked to allow imbibition, then bisected to expose the embryo; (2) Cut seeds are placed in a solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), a colorless, water-soluble compound; (3) In metabolically active (living) cells, mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes reduce TTC to triphenylformazan, an insoluble red compound that stains the tissue red/pink; (4) Dead cells cannot perform this reduction and remain unstained (white). A trained analyst evaluates the staining pattern: if the critical embryonic structures (radicle tip, plumule, scutellum in cereals; radicle, hypocotyl, cotyledons in dicots) are stained, the seed is classified as viable. The TZ test is an official method recognized by ISTA (International Seed Testing Association) and provides viability estimates comparable to germination tests.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cleistogamy (from Greek kleistos = closed, gamos = marriage) provides reproductive assurance by guaranteeing seed production through obligate self-fertilization within closed flowers. Many cleistogamous species (like violets, Viola spp.) produce both cleistogamous (CL) flowers and chasmogamous (CH, normal opening) flowers. The CL flowers never open, and self-pollination occurs within the closed bud when pollen directly contacts the stigma. The ecological advantages include: (1) Guaranteed seed set regardless of pollinator availability—critical in environments where pollinators are scarce, unpredictable, or absent (high altitudes, early/late season, dense shade); (2) Reduced energy investment—CL flowers are small and lack petals, nectar, and scent, saving resources compared to CH flowers; (3) Efficient pollen use—no pollen is lost to wind, grooming, or pollen-collecting visitors. The tradeoff is reduced genetic diversity from selfing, but many species balance this by producing both CL and CH flowers (mixed mating), allowing some outcrossing when pollinators are available.",

The two sperm cells are contained within the vegetative cell of the pollen grain/tube as a 'cell within a cell' arrangement. They are physically connected to each other and to the vegetative cell nucleus by a cytoplasmic extension called the male germ unit (MGU). The vegetative cell nucleus typically travels near the tube tip, and the two sperm cells follow closely behind, all transported by the actin-mediated cytoplasmic streaming within the pollen tube. Upon pollen tube burst at the synergid, the two sperm cells are released along with the pollen tube cytoplasm. One sperm fuses with the egg cell and the other with the central cell. Recent live-imaging studies have shown that sperm cell delivery is mediated by specific molecular interactions between sperm cell surface proteins (including GCS1/HAP2 fusion protein) and the egg/central cell membrane. , which accurately describes sperm transport within the pollen tube.",

By physically separating the anthers and stigma—through differences in their height, position, or orientation—the flower reduces the probability that its own pollen will self-fertilize. For effective pollination, pollen must be transferred by an intermediary agent (insect, bird, wind) from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of another. Examples include: (1) Approach herkogamy—stigma extends beyond the anthers (common in many species); (2) Reverse herkogamy—anthers extend beyond the stigma; (3) Heterostyly—a specialized form involving discrete morphs (pin and thrum) with reciprocal positioning. While herkogamy does not completely prevent self-pollination (especially when pollinators carry a flower's own pollen to its stigma), it significantly reduces autonomous self-pollination and promotes cross-pollination through the requirement for pollinator-mediated transfer.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait caused by chimeric or rearranged mitochondrial genes that arose through recombination events within the mitochondrial genome. These chimeric genes encode novel proteins that are specifically toxic to the tapetum or developing microspores, causing pollen abortion without affecting female fertility. For example: in maize CMS-T (Texas), the T-urf13 gene encodes a 13 kDa protein that forms pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane, disrupting energy production in tapetum cells. In rice CMS-BT, the orf79 gene produces a cytotoxic protein. CMS is exploited commercially because CMS mothers cannot self-pollinate and must receive pollen from a different line—enabling efficient hybrid seed production without manual emasculation. Fertility is restored by nuclear Restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, most of which encode pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that bind to and degrade or prevent translation of the CMS-causing mitochondrial mRNA, neutralizing the cytotoxic effect. In the three-line hybrid system: (1) CMS line (A-line, male-sterile mother); (2) Maintainer (B-line, same nuclear genotype but normal cytoplasm); (3) Restorer (R-line, carries Rf gene to restore fertility in hybrid offspring).",

During late maturation, seeds accumulate high concentrations of non-reducing sugars—primarily sucrose and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs: raffinose, stachyose, verbascose). As water is removed during desiccation, these sugars undergo vitrification—they transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid (glass) state. This glassy matrix has several protective properties: (1) It fills the space vacated by water, preventing mechanical collapse of cellular structures; (2) The extremely high viscosity of the glassy state (approximately 10^12 Pa.s) severely limits molecular mobility, slowing degradative reactions (oxidation, Maillard reactions, hydrolysis) to negligible rates; (3) Sugars can hydrogen-bond with phospholipid head groups, replacing water molecules and maintaining membrane bilayer structure in the dry state (water replacement hypothesis). This sugar glass works synergistically with LEA proteins (which also contribute to vitrification and protein protection) and antioxidant systems. Trehalose is more prominent in resurrection plants and anhydrobiotic organisms, while sucrose and RFOs dominate in orthodox seeds.",

      "explanation": "Engineered male sterility using tissue-specific cytotoxic gene expression is a powerful biotechnological approach developed by Mariani et al. (1990). The strategy involves: (1) The barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens encodes a ribonuclease that is lethal when expressed in eukaryotic cells because it degrades cellular RNA; (2) The TA29 promoter, isolated from tobacco, drives expression exclusively in the tapetum—the anther cell layer essential for pollen development; (3) When TA29::barnase is expressed in transgenic plants, barnase ribonuclease destroys tapetum cells during early anther development, preventing pollen formation—the plant is male-sterile but otherwise normal; (4) Fertility is restored by crossing with a line expressing barstar (a specific barnase inhibitor) driven by the same TA29 promoter. In the TA29::barnase x TA29::barstar hybrid, barstar neutralizes barnase in the tapetum, allowing normal pollen development. This system has been commercialized in canola (Brassica napus) for hybrid seed production. Chemical gametocides (option A) lack specificity, manual emasculation (option C) is labor-intensive, and darkness (option D) would kill the plant.",

      "explanation": "Pollen allergenicity is caused by soluble proteins released from pollen grains upon contact with moist mucosal surfaces. When pollen grains land in the nasal mucosa, they rapidly hydrate and release proteins from two sources: (1) pollen coat proteins (deposited on the surface by the tapetum during development); and (2) cytoplasmic proteins released when the grain germinates or ruptures. These released proteins include the major pollen allergens—which are often enzymes or structural proteins with normal biological functions in pollen: Bet v 1 (birch, pathogenesis-related protein), Phl p 1 (timothy grass, expansin-like), Der p 1 (mite, cysteine protease), Amb a 1 (ragweed, pectate lyase). In sensitized individuals, these proteins bind to IgE antibodies on mast cells in the nasal mucosa, triggering mast cell degranulation and release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins—causing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever). The IgE-mediated Type I hypersensitivity response explains why only specific proteins from specific pollen species cause allergies. Sporopollenin itself is immunologically inert.",

      "explanation": "International gene bank standards (established by FAO/IPGRI, now Bioversity International) specify optimal conditions for long-term conservation of orthodox seeds: (1) Moisture content: Seeds are dried to 3-7% moisture content (species-specific optimum), which is below the threshold for enzymatic activity and puts the seed in a glassy state where chemical reactions proceed extremely slowly; (2) Temperature: Base collection storage at -18 to -20 degrees C (conventional cold storage) dramatically reduces the rate of all deteriorative reactions. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault maintains seeds at -18 degrees C in a permafrost-cooled facility; (3) Sealed containers: Hermetically sealed aluminum foil packets or glass jars prevent moisture reabsorption from the environment; (4) Reduced oxygen: Some facilities use vacuum-sealed or nitrogen-flushed containers to reduce oxidative damage. Under these conditions, many orthodox seeds remain viable for decades to centuries. Room temperature storage (option A) dramatically reduces seed longevity. While cryopreservation at -196 degrees C (option B) can extend viability even further, it requires species-specific protocols for desiccation-sensitive (recalcitrant) seeds.

      "explanation": "GCS1 (Generative Cell Specific 1), also known as HAP2 (Hapless 2), is a transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of plant sperm cells that is essential for gamete fusion. GCS1/HAP2 was identified through characterization of Arabidopsis mutants where pollen tubes reach the embryo sac and release sperm, but the sperm cells fail to fuse with the egg or central cell. Structural analysis revealed that GCS1/HAP2 is a class II fusion protein with structural homology to viral membrane fusion proteins (such as dengue virus E protein), containing a hydrophobic fusion loop that inserts into the target membrane to drive membrane merger. GCS1/HAP2 is remarkably conserved across eukaryotes—orthologs function in gamete fusion in animals (Chlamydomonas, Plasmodium, C. elegans), suggesting it represents an ancient eukaryotic fertilization mechanism. In plants, GCS1/HAP2 on the sperm surface likely interacts with receptors on the egg cell membrane (candidate egg receptors include EC1 in maize), triggering the conformational changes that drive sperm-egg membrane fusion.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Red, blue, and purple flower colors are primarily determined by anthocyanins, which are synthesized through the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The three major anthocyanidin aglycones are: pelargonidin (orange-red), cyanidin (red-magenta), and delphinidin (blue-violet), differing in the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring. The final perceived flower color is modified by: (1) Vacuolar pH—anthocyanins are red at acidic pH and blue at basic pH; (2) Co-pigmentation—non-colored flavonoids (flavones, flavonols) stack with anthocyanins to shift color toward blue (bathochromic shift); (3) Metal ion complexation—complexes with Al3+ or Fe3+ shift color to blue (as in Hydrangea, where soil aluminum availability determines flower color); (4) Glycosylation, acylation, and methylation patterns affect stability and color. The flavonoid pathway begins with phenylalanine (via the phenylpropanoid pathway) and progresses through chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Angiosperms have evolved a polyspermy block to ensure that each embryo sac receives sperm from only one pollen tube. After the first pollen tube discharges its two sperm cells into the embryo sac, a mechanism prevents additional pollen tubes from entering. This is crucial because: (1) Additional sperm would cause polyspermy—extra fertilizations would create polyploid embryos or endosperm with disrupted genome balance, leading to developmental failure; (2) In the endosperm, the 2:1 maternal:paternal genome ratio is critical for proper development (as demonstrated by interploidy cross experiments)—extra paternal genomes disrupt genomic imprinting and endosperm cellularization timing; (3) Multiple paternal contributions would create genetic conflicts within the seed. The molecular mechanism involves rapid changes in the synergid/embryo sac after the first pollen tube discharge: ethylene production, modification of LURE peptide secretion, and possibly physical changes that block additional tube entry. In feronia mutants, the polyspermy block fails and multiple pollen tubes enter the embryo sac. The FERONIA pathway thus plays a dual role in both pollen tube reception and polyspermy prevention.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The mutant phenotypes reveal three sequential, non-redundant steps in the fertilization process: (1) LURE-mediated pollen tube guidance: lure1/2 mutants show reduced but not eliminated seed set (20%), indicating that LURE peptides from synergids are important but not absolutely required for pollen tube guidance—some tubes reach ovules through other guidance mechanisms. Without LURE, guidance efficiency drops dramatically but is not zero. (2) FERONIA-mediated pollen tube reception: fer mutants show very low seed set (5%) with a characteristic pollen tube overgrowth phenotype—tubes grow into the embryo sac but fail to stop, burst, and release sperm. This shows FERONIA is required for the pollen tube discharge step downstream of tube arrival. (3) GCS1/HAP2-mediated gamete fusion: gcs1 mutant sperm result in 0% seed set despite normal tube growth and discharge, demonstrating that GCS1/HAP2 is absolutely required for the final membrane fusion event between sperm and egg/central cell.

These seeds are metabolically active at maturity, have high moisture content (30-70%), and cannot survive desiccation below a critical moisture level (typically 20-35%). They also cannot tolerate the low temperatures used for orthodox seed storage. This poses significant challenges for genetic resource conservation. Alternative strategies include: (1) Cryopreservation—excision of embryonic axes (or shoot tips) followed by rapid dehydration to an acceptable moisture level and immediate immersion in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C), vitrifying the remaining cellular water and bypassing the lethal ice crystal formation; (2) In vitro slow-growth storage—maintaining shoot tips or embryogenic cultures on nutrient media at reduced temperature and low light, slowing growth but keeping cultures alive; (3) Field gene banks—maintaining living collections of trees, though this is expensive and vulnerable to natural disasters and disease.

The primexine serves as a scaffold or template that guides where sporopollenin precursors (produced by the tapetum) will polymerize. The pattern within the primexine is determined by the microspore's own haploid gene expression and the organization of its cytoplasm and plasma membrane: (1) Colpi (germination furrows) are specified by the microspore's cytoskeleton; (2) Tectum patterns (reticulate, echinate, striate, etc.) are determined by the spacing and arrangement of primexine components. Key genes controlling exine patterning include DEX1 (Defective in Exine patterning) and RPG1 (Ruptured Pollen Grain), which are expressed in the microspore.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Xenia refers to the visible effect of the pollen parent's genotype on the endosperm (or occasionally seed coat/pericarp) characteristics of seeds produced in the current generation. This occurs because the endosperm is a triploid tissue formed by the fusion of two maternal polar nuclei (2n) with one paternal sperm nucleus (n) during double fertilization. Since the paternal genome contributes to endosperm gene expression, any dominant or dosage-dependent paternal alleles affecting endosperm composition can produce visible effects in the current seed. The classic example is in maize (Zea mays): when a yellow-endosperm variety (Y/Y maternal) is pollinated by a purple-endosperm variety carrying the dominant Pr (purple) allele, the resulting endosperm (Y/Y from mother + Pr from father) expresses the paternal Pr allele and appears purple in the current kernel. Without the paternal contribution, the kernel would be yellow. Xenia is distinguished from metaxenia (effects on maternal pericarp/fruit tissue), which involves different mechanisms. Xenia directly demonstrates the genetic contribution of the paternal genome to the triploid endosperm.",

Only the species-specific fig wasp can navigate through the ostiole to reach the flowers. The wasp depends on the fig for reproduction—female wasps enter the syconium, pollinate the flowers, and lay eggs inside short-styled pistillate flowers (gall flowers). Wasp larvae develop inside the fig, feeding on gall flower tissue. Males emerge first, mate with females inside the fig, and chew exit holes. Newly mated females collect pollen from male flowers (which mature last), exit, and seek a receptive fig of the same species to continue the cycle. This mutualism has been maintained for approximately 75-90 million years, with extensive co-speciation events. The other examples represent more generalized pollination relationships.",

In biolistic transformation, DNA-coated gold or tungsten microprojectiles (0.4-1.7 micrometers) are accelerated at high velocity into target cells using compressed gas or gunpowder charge. The microprojectiles penetrate cell walls and membranes, delivering DNA directly into the cytoplasm and nucleus. This method is species-independent and works with any tissue type. Biolistics was used for the first successful transformations of wheat, rice, and maize. However, biolistic transformation has disadvantages: random, often multicopy integration; potential for DNA rearrangement; and higher rates of transgene silencing. With improvements in Agrobacterium protocols, many monocots can now also be transformed by Agrobacterium, though biolistics remains important for chloroplast transformation.",

      "explanation": "Each component of the mature Polygonum-type embryo sac has a specific function: (I) Egg cell—the female gamete that fuses with one sperm cell during double fertilization to produce the diploid (2n) zygote, which develops into the embryo of the seed. The egg cell is positioned at the micropylar end of the embryo sac. (II) Synergid cells—two cells flanking the egg at the micropylar end. They have a specialized cell wall structure (filiform apparatus) at their micropylar end that secretes LURE peptides for pollen tube guidance. One synergid degenerates upon pollen tube arrival (facilitating tube reception through FERONIA signaling), and the other may persist briefly after fertilization. (III) Central cell—the largest cell in the embryo sac, containing two polar nuclei (which often fuse before fertilization to form the diploid secondary nucleus). The central cell fuses with the second sperm cell, producing the triploid (3n) primary endosperm nucleus that divides to form the endosperm. (IV) Antipodal cells—three cells at the chalazal end that may have nutritive functions (transferring nutrients from maternal tissue to the embryo sac). In many species (including Arabidopsis), they degenerate early in embryo sac development.",

      "explanation": "Golden Rice was developed by Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer to address vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which causes blindness and death in millions of children in rice-dependent developing countries. Rice endosperm naturally produces geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a precursor in the isoprenoid pathway, but lacks the downstream enzymes to convert GGPP to beta-carotene. The genetic modification involved introducing two transgenes: (1) Phytoene synthase (PSY)—originally from daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), later replaced with a more active version from maize (Zea mays) in Golden Rice 2—catalyzes the conversion of GGPP to phytoene; (2) Carotene desaturase (CrtI) from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora (Pantoea ananatis)—a single bacterial enzyme that performs the four desaturation and isomerization steps normally requiring two plant enzymes (PDS and ZDS), converting phytoene to lycopene. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by endogenous endosperm enzymes. The resulting transgenic rice produces beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving it a golden color. Golden Rice 2 produces up to 37 micrograms/g carotenoids.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase plays a critical role in establishing genomic imprinting in angiosperms. DME is expressed specifically in the central cell of the embryo sac (and also in the vegetative cell of the pollen grain), where it actively removes DNA methylation from specific genomic loci through a base excision repair pathway. This demethylation activates maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs) in the central cell, which will continue to be expressed from the maternal alleles in the endosperm after fertilization. Key genes activated by DME-mediated demethylation include: (1) MEA (MEDEA)—a Polycomb group protein that restricts endosperm proliferation; (2) FIS2—another Polycomb component; (3) FWA—an endosperm-specific homeodomain transcription factor. The paternal alleles of these genes remain methylated and silenced in the sperm and subsequently in the endosperm, creating parent-of-origin-specific (imprinted) expression. dme mutant seeds show excessive endosperm proliferation and seed abortion because the maternal MEA/FIS2 alleles are not activated. This epigenetic reprogramming in the central cell is essential for normal endosperm development and represents a key mechanism of genomic imprinting in plants.",

Whorl 3 (androecium): 6 stamens in a tetradynamous arrangement—4 long medial stamens and 2 short lateral stamens. The 4 long stamens arise from the inner stamen whorl and the 2 short from the outer whorl. Whorl 4 (gynoecium): 2 fused carpels forming a single pistil with a superior ovary divided by a false septum (replum), producing a fruit type called a silique. This arrangement makes Arabidopsis an excellent model for studying floral organ identity (ABC model), as it has all four organ types in a simple, reproducible pattern.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Temporal (phenological) isolation is a prezygotic reproductive barrier that operates when closely related sympatric species flower at different times, preventing interspecific pollen transfer even when they share the same pollinators and habitat. For example, early-blooming and late-blooming species of Silene, Mimulus, or Iris may be completely reproductively isolated simply because their flowering windows do not overlap. This is an effective barrier because fertilization requires that viable pollen from one species reaches receptive stigmas of the other species—if they flower weeks or months apart, this cannot occur. Temporal isolation is one of the most common prezygotic barriers in sympatric plant speciation. It can evolve through natural selection if hybrids have reduced fitness (reinforcement) or as a byproduct of adaptation to different environments. Climate change is disrupting temporal isolation in some plant communities by shifting flowering phenology, potentially increasing hybridization between previously isolated species. Vernalization differences and seed germination timing are separate phenomena that may contribute to ecological separation but are not direct reproductive isolation mechanisms.",

Step 2—Chromosome doubling: The haploid plant's genome is doubled using colchicine (which inhibits microtubule polymerization, preventing cell division while allowing DNA replication) to produce a completely homozygous diploid plant. The resulting doubled haploid is homozygous at every locus—equivalent to what would require 6-8 generations of selfing in conventional breeding.

      "explanation": "In bitegmic ovules (having two integuments, characteristic of most eudicots), both inner and outer integuments grow as ring-shaped primordia from the base of the nucellus, extending upward to enclose the nucellus tissue and the developing megagametophyte within. They do not completely close; instead, they leave a small pore at the apex called the micropyle, which serves as the entry point for the pollen tube during fertilization. The inner integument typically grows faster and extends beyond the outer integument at the micropyle. After fertilization, both integuments differentiate into the seed coat (testa): the outer integument typically forms the outer testa layers (which may become hard, pigmented, or mucilaginous depending on species), while the inner integument forms the inner testa layers (tegmen). In Arabidopsis, the outer integument has 2 cell layers and the inner integument has 3 cell layers, each differentiating into distinct cell types during seed maturation.

The key advantages over conventional phenotypic selection include: (1) Early-generation selection—seedlings can be screened with DNA markers at the 2-3 leaf stage, allowing early elimination of undesirable genotypes without growing plants to maturity. This is especially valuable for traits expressed late in development (grain quality, fruit characteristics, seed composition); (2) Selection for traits difficult to score phenotypically—disease resistance genes can be tracked by markers without exposing plants to pathogens; root architecture can be selected without destructive harvesting; (3) Pyramiding multiple resistance genes—MAS can track multiple resistance genes simultaneously in the same background, which is nearly impossible phenotypically when genes confer resistance to the same pathogen; (4) Background selection—recovering the recurrent parent genome more rapidly during backcross breeding. MAS does not modify the genome (that is genetic engineering). MAS can be used for both simple and complex traits (through QTL-linked markers). Field trials remain necessary for variety release.",

Examples include peach, cherry, plum, olive, coconut (the 'shell' is the endocarp), and mango. Berry: The entire pericarp is fleshy, with no stony layer. Seeds are embedded within the fleshy tissue. Examples include tomato (the entire fruit wall is fleshy), grape, blueberry, banana, avocado (has a single large seed but the endocarp is not stony), and citrus (a specialized berry called a hesperidium).

This is critical because living cells are required to respond to hormonal signals; (2) They contain protein bodies (aleurone grains containing storage proteins, phytate, and mineral deposits) and lipid bodies (oleosomes), but little or no starch; (3) They have thick cell walls and maintain cellular integrity throughout grain development and storage; (4) They are competent to perceive and respond to gibberellin (GA) signaling during germination. When GA from the embryo reaches aleurone cells, it activates GA signaling through GID1/DELLA pathway, leading to GAMYB transcription factor activation and expression of hydrolytic enzyme genes (alpha-amylase, proteases, cell wall-degrading enzymes).

These three cells are: (1) The vegetative cell—the largest cell, which contains the tube cell nucleus and will generate the pollen tube upon germination. The vegetative cell contains most of the cytoplasm, organelles, and mRNAs needed for rapid tube growth; (2) Two sperm cells—small cells enclosed within the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell. Sperm cells are formed by pollen mitosis II (the division of the generative cell). They are connected to each other and to the vegetative nucleus by cytoplasmic extensions, forming the male germ unit (MGU). In some species (e.g., grasses, Brassicaceae), pollen is shed at the 3-celled stage. In others (e.g., Solanaceae, Liliaceae), pollen is shed at the 2-celled stage (vegetative cell + generative cell), and the generative cell divides to form two sperm cells during pollen tube growth.

      "explanation": "To demonstrate true circadian regulation of flower scent production (as opposed to simple light/dark-driven responses), the experimental design must include: (1) First experiment—measure volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from flowers at regular intervals (every 2-4 hours) over at least 24 hours under normal photoperiod conditions (e.g., 16:8 L:D) using headspace collection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This establishes whether emission patterns show diel rhythmicity. (2) Second experiment (critical)—repeat the measurements under constant conditions (continuous light or continuous darkness at constant temperature). If scent emission continues to oscillate with an approximately 24-hour period under constant conditions, this demonstrates circadian clock regulation (free-running rhythm). If emission becomes constant under continuous conditions, the rhythm was driven by external light/dark cues, not an endogenous clock. (3) Additional support—measure expression of scent biosynthesis genes (e.g., BSMT, BAMT for methyl benzoate, LIS for linalool) to determine whether rhythmic emission correlates with rhythmic gene expression. Many flowers (Petunia, Nicotiana, Antirrhinum) show circadian scent emission, with emission peaking at times matching pollinator activity.",

Compatibility generally correlates with taxonomic relatedness: grafting within the same species or genus is usually successful (apple on apple rootstock, Citrus on Citrus), while grafting between different families almost always fails. Compatibility is not limited to clones—different cultivars, species, and sometimes genera within the same family can be grafted successfully.",

        "Flowering is promoted because the red light is perceived as dawn by phytochrome A",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In short-day plants (SDPs), flowering requires an uninterrupted dark period exceeding a critical minimum length. A brief flash of red light during the middle of a long dark period (night-break) inhibits flowering because: (1) Red light is absorbed by the Pr form of phytochrome, converting it to the active Pfr form; (2) In SDPs, Pfr accumulation during what should be the continuous dark period disrupts the signaling pathway required for florigen (FT) production. The molecular mechanism involves the interaction between the circadian clock, phytochrome signaling, and CONSTANS (CO) protein regulation. In SDPs like rice, the CO ortholog Hd1 promotes FT (Hd3a) expression only during long nights—Pfr generated by a night-break interferes with this pathway, preventing FT accumulation. The effect can be reversed by immediately following the red flash with far-red light (which converts Pfr back to Pr), confirming the involvement of the phytochrome red/far-red photoreversible system. This night-break response demonstrates that SDPs measure the duration of continuous darkness, not the length of the light period.",

      "explanation": "Embryo sac polarity in the Polygonum type is established through the positional identity of the surviving megaspore and subsequent nuclear migration: (1) After meiosis of the megaspore mother cell, four megaspores are arranged in a linear tetrad. Three chalazal megaspores degenerate, and the chalazal-most megaspore survives. (2) The surviving functional megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis, producing 8 nuclei in a coenocytic cell. (3) Nuclear migration establishes polarity: 4 nuclei migrate to the micropylar end and 4 to the chalazal end. (4) Cellularization creates the 7-celled structure: at the micropylar end, the egg cell and two synergids (the egg apparatus); at the chalazal end, three antipodal cells; and in the center, the large central cell with two polar nuclei (one from each group of 4). The micropylar-chalazal axis is thus determined by the original position of the functional megaspore within the ovule and is maintained through subsequent development by auxin gradients and position-dependent gene expression.

      "explanation": "Climacteric and non-climacteric fruits represent two fundamentally different ripening programs: Climacteric fruits (tomato, banana, apple, avocado, mango, peach): show a dramatic increase in respiration rate (the respiratory climacteric, measured as a CO2 production spike) and an autocatalytic burst of ethylene production during the onset of ripening. The ethylene burst is autocatalytic because ethylene stimulates its own biosynthesis (System 2 ethylene production). Once initiated, the process is irreversible and proceeds rapidly. These fruits can ripen after harvest (off the plant) and can be artificially ripened by ethylene application. Non-climacteric fruits (grape, strawberry, cherry, citrus, pineapple): ripen gradually without a respiratory burst or autocatalytic ethylene production. They produce low, basal levels of ethylene. Ripening changes (color, sugar accumulation, acid reduction) occur progressively and are primarily regulated by ABA rather than ethylene. These fruits do not ripen after harvest and must be harvested ripe. Both types can be fleshy or have seeds.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The triploid block (also called the endosperm balance number system) is a post-zygotic barrier that prevents successful interploidy crosses between plant species. The mechanism centers on the requirement for a specific maternal:paternal genome ratio (typically 2m:1p) in the endosperm for normal development. When plants of different ploidy levels are crossed: For example, a tetraploid (4x) mother crossed with a diploid (2x) father produces endosperm with a 4m:1p ratio (excess maternal contribution), which causes precocious cellularization and small, aborted endosperm. Conversely, a diploid mother crossed with a tetraploid father produces endosperm with a 2m:2p ratio (excess paternal contribution), causing delayed cellularization and endosperm overproliferation. In both cases, the abnormal endosperm development leads to seed abortion, even though the hybrid embryo itself may be viable (this is why embryo rescue can recover such hybrids). The triploid block is mediated by genomic imprinting—dosage-sensitive imprinted genes in the endosperm cannot tolerate deviations from the 2:1 ratio. This barrier is distinct from prezygotic incompatibility and from triploid sterility.",

      "explanation": "Pollen competition (certation) occurs when multiple pollen grains germinate on a stigma and their tubes race through the style to reach ovules. Since typically many more pollen grains are deposited than there are ovules to fertilize, only the fastest-growing pollen tubes successfully fertilize ovules. The hypothesis that pollen competition improves offspring quality is supported by several lines of evidence: (1) Pollen tube growth rate is influenced by the pollen's haploid genome—faster tubes tend to carry alleles for higher metabolic activity, more efficient protein synthesis, and better cellular organization; (2) These same alleles, when expressed in the resulting sporophyte, contribute to higher plant vigor. Studies have shown that offspring from stigmas receiving large pollen loads (high competition) have higher seed weight, faster germination, greater seedling vigor, and higher seed production compared to offspring from stigmas receiving small pollen loads (low competition). This mechanism may function as a form of 'sexual selection' in plants—analogous to sperm competition in animals—that provides a non-random filter favoring genetically superior gametophytes and, consequently, more vigorous sporophyte offspring.",

In diplosporous species (e.g., Taraxacum, dandelions), meiosis is either not initiated or is interrupted/modified at an early stage, so the MMC undergoes mitotic-like divisions to produce an unreduced (2n) embryo sac. The embryo then develops from the unreduced egg cell parthenogenetically without fertilization, producing offspring genetically identical to the mother plant. This contrasts with apospory (option A describes this), where a somatic nucellar cell develops into the unreduced embryo sac.

The tapetum synthesizes sporopollenin precursors and exports them both directly and via orbicules to the locular fluid where they are deposited onto the primexine matrix of the microspore surface. Sporopollenin is one of the most chemically resistant biopolymers known, consisting of complex fatty acid and phenylpropanoid derivatives, making the pollen wall highly resistant to decay, UV radiation, and chemical degradation. The intine (inner wall) is produced by the microspore itself from cellulose and pectin.

After fertilization, the primary endosperm nucleus undergoes rapid free-nuclear (syncytial) divisions without cytokinesis, producing a multinucleate coenocyte. When a critical nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is achieved, cellularization begins. Radial microtubule systems (RMS) extend from each nucleus toward the periphery and interact with RMS from neighboring nuclei. At the zones where these microtubule systems overlap, phragmoplasts form and cell plates are deposited, progressively partitioning the syncytium into individual cells. This process typically begins at the micropylar end and proceeds toward the chalazal end.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pollen tube growth is a classic example of tip growth, critically dependent on a steep tip-focused calcium gradient. This gradient is maintained by calcium influx through stretch-activated and/or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels concentrated at the extreme apex of the tube. The high calcium concentration at the tip serves multiple essential functions: it promotes exocytic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (delivering new cell wall material and membrane), regulates actin dynamics (high Ca2+ depolymerizes actin at the extreme tip creating the clear zone while an actin collar behind the tip drives vesicle delivery), and activates calcium-dependent protein kinases and other signaling molecules. La3+ blocks calcium channels at the plasma membrane, collapsing the influx and thus the gradient. The rapid cessation of growth (within 30 seconds) and its reversibility upon washout demonstrate that continuous calcium influx is necessary for sustained polarized growth.

In this process, somatic cells of the nucellus (and occasionally the inner integument) adjacent to the developing embryo sac are induced to undergo embryogenesis. These nucellar embryos are genetically identical to the mother plant (2n, maternal genotype) since they arise from mitotic divisions of sporophytic tissue without meiosis or fertilization. They develop alongside the sexually produced zygotic embryo within the same ovule and seed. In many Citrus cultivars, the nucellar embryos are more vigorous than the zygotic embryo and dominate the seedling population. This phenomenon is exploited commercially to produce uniform rootstocks.

This creates an essentially water-impermeable barrier that prevents imbibition and thus germination. The coat may also be impermeable to gases. In nature, this dormancy is broken by scarification mechanisms: mechanical abrasion (from soil particles, rocks), chemical scarification (passage through the acidic digestive tract of animals—an important dispersal mechanism), microbial decomposition of the coat, or temperature cycling (particularly freeze-thaw cycles or fire) that create cracks in the coat. Once the coat is breached, water enters through the strophiole (a specialized region near the hilum), triggering imbibition and germination.

In fis mutants, the repression is lost: unfertilized ovules autonomously initiate endosperm development (free-nuclear divisions of the central cell) without pollination or fertilization—this is the hallmark phenotype that gives the complex its name. When fis mutant ovules are fertilized, the resulting seeds show endosperm overproliferation and typically abort, because the normal restraints on endosperm growth are absent.

In maize, the endosperm is triploid (3n), formed by fusion of two maternal polar nuclei (each n) with one paternal sperm nucleus (n), giving a 2m:1p genomic ratio. Because the endosperm is a genetically distinct tissue that expresses both maternal and paternal alleles, the pollen genotype can directly influence endosperm phenotype. For example, if a yellow-endosperm (Y) pollen grain fertilizes a white-endosperm (y/y) plant, the resulting endosperm is Yyy and, since Y is dominant, the kernel appears yellow. The straightforward expression of paternal alleles in the triploid endosperm is the primary mechanism of xenia. While genomic imprinting does occur in endosperm, xenia is fundamentally explained by standard gene expression of paternal alleles in the triploid tissue, not by imprinting escape. This is distinct from metaxenia, which affects maternal fruit tissues.",

      "question": "In orchids, the pollen grains are typically aggregated into pollinia—compact masses of pollen delivered as a unit to the stigma. What is the primary adaptive significance of pollinia in orchid reproduction?",
      "options": [
        "Pollinia protect pollen grains from UV radiation damage during the extended period orchid flowers remain open",
        "Pollinia prevent self-pollination by physically blocking the stigma until a pollinator removes them",
        "Pollinia reduce the cost of pollen production, allowing orchids to invest more resources in ovule production and elaborate floral structures for pollinator attraction",
        "Pollinia enable wind pollination in orchids by providing sufficient mass for ballistic pollen dispersal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Orchids (Orchidaceae) package nearly all their pollen into discrete pollinia (typically 2, 4, or 8 per flower), which are removed and deposited as intact units by pollinators. This strategy ensures that when pollination does occur, a massive number of pollen grains are delivered simultaneously, achieving high fertilization efficiency per pollinator visit. Because orchids produce extremely numerous, tiny, dust-like seeds (often hundreds of thousands per capsule), they require pollination of many ovules at once. The pollinium strategy allows orchids to minimize investment in total pollen production while maximizing the pollen delivered per successful visit. This freed resource can be allocated to the elaborate floral morphologies, fragrances, and deceptive mechanisms (mimicry, pseudocopulation) that attract specific pollinators. The trade-off is high dependence on specific pollinators and risk of reproductive failure if pollinators are absent. Orchids are overwhelmingly animal-pollinated, not wind-pollinated.",

      "question": "Vivipary is a reproductive strategy in which seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. In mangroves such as Rhizophora, what is the ecological advantage of this crypto-viviparous strategy?",
      "options": [
        "It allows the embryo to photosynthesize while still on the parent, building carbohydrate reserves that reduce dependence on endosperm",
        "It prevents seed predation by herbivores that cannot digest actively growing seedling tissues",
        "The elongated hypocotyl (propagule) can establish immediately upon dropping into the sediment, bypassing the vulnerable dormant seed stage in the harsh intertidal environment",
        "Vivipary enables the parent plant to selectively abort non-viable embryos before investing in fruit maturation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mangrove vivipary (technically crypto-vivipary, since the fruit wall is breached by the emerging radicle) is a key adaptation to the challenging intertidal environment. In Rhizophora species, the embryo continues developing on the parent plant after fruit maturation, producing a long, pencil-shaped hypocotyl (propagule) that can reach 20-40 cm in length. When the propagule drops, its elongated, dense hypocotyl can penetrate the soft sediment and anchor immediately, or float in an upright position until it reaches suitable substrate. This strategy bypasses the dormant seed stage, which would be disadvantageous in tidal environments where seeds could be washed away, waterlogged, or exposed to high salinity before establishing. The propagule already has functional chlorophyll and a well-developed root meristem, enabling rapid establishment. Salt tolerance mechanisms are already active in the propagule tissues. This vivipary is regulated by reduced ABA sensitivity and modified gibberellin signaling compared to non-viviparous species.",

      "question": "The suspensor is a transient embryonic structure that connects the developing embryo to the maternal tissue. In Arabidopsis, what are the primary functions of the suspensor during early embryogenesis?",
      "options": [
        "The suspensor secretes ethylene to signal the endosperm to begin cellularization around the developing embryo",
        "The suspensor generates the shoot apical meristem through asymmetric cell divisions and is the source of all above-ground plant tissues",
        "The suspensor produces the embryo sac cuticle that prevents desiccation of the developing embryo within the ovule",
        "The suspensor anchors the embryo to maternal tissue and serves as a nutrient conduit, transporting sucrose and auxin to the embryo proper, while its uppermost cell (hypophysis) contributes to root meristem formation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The suspensor is established by the first asymmetric division of the zygote in Arabidopsis, which produces a small apical cell (giving rise to most of the embryo proper) and a larger basal cell (giving rise to the suspensor and the hypophysis). The suspensor serves as a structural anchor connecting the embryo to the maternal tissue at the micropylar end of the ovule, and critically functions as a nutrient pipeline. It contains transfer cell-like wall ingrowths that increase membrane surface area for active uptake of nutrients (sucrose, amino acids, minerals) from the surrounding endosperm and maternal tissues, channeling them to the embryo proper. The suspensor is also an important source of auxin during early embryogenesis—IAA synthesized in the suspensor is transported to the embryo proper via PIN7 efflux carriers, establishing the apical-basal auxin gradient essential for embryo patterning. The uppermost suspensor cell (hypophysis) is incorporated into the embryo and gives rise to the quiescent center and columella of the root meristem. The suspensor undergoes programmed cell death as the embryo matures.",

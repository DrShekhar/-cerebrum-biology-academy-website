      "question": "Fixed action patterns (FAPs) are stereotyped behavioral sequences triggered by specific stimuli. Which of the following best describes the key properties of a FAP?",
      "options": [
        "FAPs are highly variable behaviors that differ significantly each time they are performed",
        "FAPs are innate, stereotyped behavioral sequences triggered by a specific sign stimulus (releaser) — once initiated, the motor program runs to completion regardless of changes in sensory feedback; they are species-specific and performed without prior learning, as demonstrated by Lorenz and Tinbergen's studies on the egg-retrieval behavior of the greylag goose",
        "FAPs are entirely learned behaviors that require extensive practice to perform correctly",
        "FAPs are conscious voluntary decisions that can be stopped at any point during execution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Fixed action patterns are fundamental concepts in classical ethology, formalized by Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen. Key properties: (1) Innate — FAPs develop without learning, as shown by isolation (Kaspar Hauser) experiments where animals raised without exposure to conspecifics still perform species-typical FAPs. (2) Stereotyped — the motor pattern is highly consistent within a species, performed the same way each time (though minor variations exist). (3) Species-specific — each species has its own repertoire of FAPs. (4) Ballistic — once triggered, the complete sequence runs to completion even if the triggering stimulus is removed. Lorenz demonstrated this with the greylag goose egg-retrieval behavior: if the egg is removed mid-retrieval, the goose completes the bill-tucking motion. (5) Triggered by sign stimuli (releasers) — specific sensory cues that activate an innate releasing mechanism (IRM). Tinbergen showed that three-spined stickleback males attack models with red undersides (sign stimulus for territorial aggression), regardless of overall shape. (6) Threshold varies — the internal motivational state affects how easily a FAP is triggered (vacuum behavior occurs when motivation is very high without a releaser). Modern neuroethology has identified the neural circuits underlying many FAPs, though the strict 'ballistic' criterion has been relaxed somewhat.",

      "question": "Inclusive fitness theory, proposed by W.D. Hamilton, explains the evolution of altruistic behavior. What is Hamilton's rule?",
      "options": [
        "Hamilton's rule states that altruistic behavior will be favored by natural selection when rB > C, where r is the coefficient of relatedness between altruist and recipient, B is the reproductive benefit to the recipient, and C is the reproductive cost to the altruist — this explains why eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps) with haplodiploid sex determination have unusually high r among sisters (0.75)",
        "Hamilton's rule states that all organisms always behave selfishly to maximize their own reproduction",
        "Hamilton's rule applies only to parental care, not to interactions between siblings or other relatives",
        "Hamilton's rule states that altruism evolves only in species with exactly two offspring per generation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "W.D. Hamilton's 1964 papers on the genetic evolution of social behavior introduced inclusive fitness theory, one of the most important concepts in behavioral ecology. Hamilton's rule: an allele for altruistic behavior will spread when rB > C, where: r = coefficient of relatedness (probability of sharing the allele by descent). For diploid organisms: parent-offspring r = 0.5, full siblings r = 0.5, half-siblings r = 0.25, grandparent-grandchild r = 0.25, cousins r = 0.125. B = reproductive benefit gained by the recipient due to the altruistic act. C = reproductive cost to the altruist. The concept of inclusive fitness = direct fitness (own reproduction) + indirect fitness (reproduction of relatives weighted by r). This explains kin selection — organisms can increase the transmission of their genes by helping relatives reproduce. Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera creates an asymmetry: sisters share r = 0.75 (they share 100% of their father's haploid genome and 50% of their mother's diploid genome). This makes sisters more related to each other than to their own daughters (r = 0.5), potentially favoring worker sterility — though haplodiploidy alone is insufficient to explain eusociality, as it also predicts reduced investment in brothers (r = 0.25). Hamilton's famous quip: 'I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins' (2 × 0.5 > 1; 8 × 0.125 > 1).",

      "question": "Imprinting is a form of learning that occurs during a critical (sensitive) period early in development. What is filial imprinting, and what neural mechanism underlies it?",
      "options": [
        "Filial imprinting is the process by which a young precocial bird learns the characteristics of its parent during a brief sensitive period (typically the first 24-48 hours post-hatching) — Lorenz demonstrated this with greylag goslings that imprinted on him; the neural substrate involves the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM) in the chick forebrain, where synaptic changes encode the visual features of the imprinted object",
        "Imprinting occurs throughout the animal's entire lifespan with equal effectiveness",
        "Imprinting only affects auditory processing and has no visual component",
        "Imprinting is identical to classical conditioning and uses the same neural circuits"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Filial imprinting, described by Konrad Lorenz (Nobel Prize 1973), is a form of rapid, irreversible learning during a critical sensitive period that establishes the identity of the parent figure. Key features: (1) Sensitive period — occurs during a defined developmental window (~12-36 hours post-hatching in chickens, up to ~48 hours in geese). Before and after this window, imprinting is much less effective. (2) Rapid — exposure for as little as 10 minutes can be sufficient. (3) Relatively irreversible — once established, the imprinted preference is stable and difficult to modify. (4) Influences later behavior — filial imprinting determines which individual the young follow (attachment), while sexual imprinting (a related process occurring later) influences mate choice. (5) Species generality — occurs in many precocial birds and some mammals. Neural basis: In domestic chicks, Gabriel Horn and colleagues identified the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM, formerly IMHV) as the critical brain region. During imprinting: (a) NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in IMM encodes visual features of the imprinted object. (b) c-fos expression increases in IMM during the sensitive period. (c) Dendritic spine density changes in IMM neurons. (d) Bilateral IMM lesions prevent imprinting but do not affect already-imprinted preferences (stored elsewhere after consolidation). Option B ignores the sensitive period. Option C is too narrow. Option D mischaracterizes the learning type.",

      "question": "Optimal foraging theory predicts that animals will maximize their net energy intake per unit time while foraging. What is the marginal value theorem?",
      "options": [
        "The marginal value theorem (Charnov, 1976) predicts that an optimal forager should leave a depleting food patch when the marginal rate of energy gain in that patch drops to the average rate of gain for the habitat as a whole, including travel time between patches — this means animals should stay longer in rich patches and leave poor patches sooner, spending more time traveling when patches are far apart",
        "Animals should always consume all food in a patch before moving to the next one",
        "Animals should spend equal time in every food patch regardless of patch quality",
        "The theorem states that animals should always forage in the nearest patch to minimize travel time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The marginal value theorem (MVT), formulated by Eric Charnov (1976), is one of the most successful quantitative predictions in behavioral ecology. The model assumes: (1) Food patches are distributed across a habitat, separated by travel time. (2) Within a patch, the rate of food intake decreases over time as the patch is depleted (diminishing returns — a negatively accelerated gain function). (3) The forager cannot simultaneously forage and travel. The optimization: an animal should leave a patch when the instantaneous (marginal) rate of energy gain equals the long-term average rate for the entire habitat. Graphically, this is found by drawing a tangent line from the travel time point to the gain function curve. Predictions: (a) Animals stay longer in richer patches (more food to extract before marginal rate drops to average). (b) Animals stay longer in all patches when travel time between patches increases (average rate is lower, so the marginal rate takes longer to decline to that level). (c) Animals leave patches sooner in habitats with many high-quality patches (average rate is higher). These predictions have been confirmed in many species, including great tits foraging in artificial patches, bumblebees visiting flowers, and starlings feeding nestlings. Deviations from MVT predictions reveal important factors like predation risk, incomplete information, and state-dependent decisions.",

      "question": "The waggle dance of honeybees communicates the location of food sources to hive mates. What information is encoded in the dance?",
      "options": [
        "The waggle dance, decoded by Karl von Frisch (Nobel Prize 1973), encodes both distance and direction to a food source — the angle of the waggle run relative to vertical on the comb indicates the angle between the food source and the sun's azimuth, while the duration of the waggle phase encodes distance (approximately 1 second per km); the vigor of dancing correlates with food quality",
        "The waggle dance only communicates the type of flower at the food source through different wing-beat frequencies",
        "The waggle dance is a random movement with no informational content",
        "The waggle dance communicates only the distance to food, not its direction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Karl von Frisch's decoding of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) waggle dance is one of the most celebrated discoveries in animal behavior. The dance is performed on the vertical surface of a dark hive comb: (1) Direction — the waggle phase is a straight run in which the bee waggles its abdomen while walking. The angle of this waggle run relative to straight up (antigravity) on the comb represents the angle between the food source and the sun's azimuth as seen from the hive. Dancing straight up = food in the direction of the sun; straight down = food opposite to the sun; 60° right of vertical = food 60° right of the sun. The dancer compensates for the sun's movement over time. (2) Distance — the duration of the waggle phase correlates with distance to the food. In Apis mellifera, approximately 1 second of waggling indicates ~1 km (varies by subspecies). Distance can also be encoded by the number of waggle cycles and the tempo of the dance circuit. (3) Quality — the vigor, duration, and number of dance circuits correlate with food source quality (nectar concentration, abundance). High-quality sources elicit more enthusiastic dancing, recruiting more foragers. (4) Odor — dance followers also detect floral odors on the dancer's body, aiding source identification. James Gould (1975) confirmed the symbolic nature using artificial light to manipulate the bees' sun reference, showing recruits indeed follow the dance's directional information.",

      "options": [
        "In classical conditioning, the animal learns an association between two stimuli (a neutral conditioned stimulus paired with an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an innate response), producing a conditioned response — in operant conditioning, the animal learns an association between its own behavior and a consequence (reward or punishment), modifying the frequency of that behavior according to Thorndike's law of effect",

        "Only vertebrates can undergo classical conditioning, while operant conditioning occurs in all animals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Classical and operant conditioning represent two distinct forms of associative learning, each with different neural substrates and functional significance. Classical (Pavlovian) conditioning: Discovered by Ivan Pavlov (~1900). An initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g., bell tone) is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US, e.g., food) that naturally elicits an unconditioned response (UR, e.g., salivation). After pairing, the CS alone elicits a conditioned response (CR, salivation to the bell). Key features: (a) The animal learns a predictive relationship between stimuli. (b) The response is typically reflexive/involuntary (autonomic). (c) Neural substrate: amygdala (fear conditioning), cerebellum (eyeblink conditioning). Operant (instrumental) conditioning: Formalized by B.F. Skinner (1938), building on Thorndike's law of effect (1898). The animal learns that its own behavior has consequences: behaviors followed by positive outcomes (reinforcement) increase in frequency; behaviors followed by negative outcomes (punishment) decrease. Key features: (a) The animal learns a contingency between action and outcome. (b) Responses are typically voluntary/skeletal. (c) Neural substrate: basal ganglia (striatum), prefrontal cortex, dopaminergic reward pathway (VTA→nucleus accumbens). Both forms show extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, and discrimination. The Rescorla-Wagner model (1972) mathematically describes CS-US associative strength changes in classical conditioning.",

      "options": [
        "Tit-for-tat, a strategy that cooperates on the first move and then copies the opponent's previous move — it succeeds because it is nice (never defects first), retaliatory (immediately punishes defection), forgiving (returns to cooperation after the opponent cooperates), and clear (easy for opponents to recognize and adapt to), promoting stable mutual cooperation in repeated interactions",
        "Always defect — the strategy that maximizes individual payoff regardless of the opponent's behavior",

        "Always cooperate — unconditionally helping regardless of the opponent's behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Robert Axelrod's famous tournament (1984) invited game theorists to submit strategies for an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) played against each other strategy. The simplest strategy, tit-for-tat (TFT) submitted by Anatol Rapoport, won both tournaments. TFT's properties: (1) Nice — begins by cooperating, establishing a cooperative relationship. (2) Retaliatory — immediately defects after the opponent defects, punishing exploitation. (3) Forgiving — returns to cooperation when the opponent cooperates, allowing recovery from mutual defection. (4) Clear — its simple pattern is easily recognized by other strategies, facilitating mutual cooperation. In the context of biological evolution: (a) Reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971) explains cooperation between non-relatives through repeated interactions where future reciprocation is expected. (b) TFT-like strategies are observed in nature: vampire bats share blood meals reciprocally and punish non-reciprocators; cleaner fish and client fish maintain cooperative relationships. (c) For TFT to evolve, individuals must: meet repeatedly, recognize each other, and remember past interactions. (d) 'Always defect' wins single interactions but performs poorly long-term because it never establishes cooperative partnerships. 'Always cooperate' is exploited by defectors. Later work showed tit-for-tat with some generosity (occasional forgiveness of defection) outperforms strict TFT in noisy environments where errors occur.",

      "options": [
        "The master circadian clock is in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus — it generates ~24-hour rhythms through interlocking transcription-translation feedback loops: CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins heterodimerize to activate transcription of Period (Per1/2) and Cryptochrome (Cry1/2) genes; PER-CRY complexes accumulate, enter the nucleus, and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1, suppressing their own transcription; this cycle takes ~24 hours and is entrained to the light-dark cycle via retinohypothalamic tract input from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing melanopsin",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The mammalian circadian system is a hierarchical oscillator network with the SCN as the master pacemaker. The SCN (~20,000 neurons in mice, bilateral) generates self-sustained ~24-hour oscillations even in complete darkness (free-running period ~24.2 hours in humans). The molecular clock mechanism involves two interlocking feedback loops: Primary loop: (1) CLOCK and BMAL1 (basic helix-loop-helix PAS domain transcription factors) heterodimerize and bind E-box elements in the promoters of Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2 genes, activating their transcription (positive limb). (2) PER and CRY proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm, heterodimerize, are phosphorylated by casein kinases (CK1δ/ε), and translocate to the nucleus. (3) Nuclear PER-CRY complexes directly inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity (negative limb). (4) PER-CRY degradation (ubiquitination by E3 ligases) releases the inhibition, allowing CLOCK-BMAL1 to restart the cycle. Secondary loop: REV-ERBα (repressor) and RORα (activator) regulate Bmal1 transcription, adding robustness. Entrainment: Light detected by melanopsin-containing ipRGCs (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells) signals via the retinohypothalamic tract (glutamate + PACAP) to the SCN, inducing Per1/Per2 expression and phase-shifting the clock. The SCN synchronizes peripheral clocks in liver, lung, kidney, etc. Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2017 was awarded to Hall, Rosbash, and Young for elucidating the molecular clock mechanism in Drosophila.",

      "explanation": "Kin selection (I-R): Hamilton's concept that natural selection can favor genes promoting altruistic behavior toward relatives because relatives share alleles by descent. The gene's-eye-view: an allele for helping relatives can increase in frequency if the benefit to the recipient (weighted by relatedness) exceeds the cost to the altruist. Examples: alarm calls in Belding's ground squirrels (females call more when relatives are nearby), eusociality in Hymenoptera. Reciprocal altruism (II-P): Trivers (1971) proposed that cooperation between non-relatives can evolve through repeated interactions where each partner reciprocates help. Requirements: repeated encounters, individual recognition, memory of past interactions, and punishment of cheaters. Examples: vampire bat blood sharing, grooming in primates, cleaner fish mutualism. Modeled by iterated prisoner's dilemma. Sexual selection (III-Q): Darwin's (1871) concept of selection for traits that increase mating success, operating through two mechanisms: intrasexual selection (competition between same-sex individuals — antlers, fighting) and intersexual selection (mate choice — peacock tail, bowerbird displays). Can produce exaggerated traits that reduce survival but increase mating success (Fisherian runaway, handicap principle/Zahavi). Frequency-dependent selection (IV-S): Fitness depends on how common a phenotype is. Negative FDS maintains polymorphisms (rare morphs have higher fitness — e.g., predator search image, alternative mating strategies in side-blotched lizards). Positive FDS eliminates rare variants.",

        "Song learning occurs in two phases: a sensory phase (approximately days 20-65 post-hatching in zebra finch) during which the bird memorizes a tutor's song template through auditory exposure, and a sensorimotor phase (~35-90 days) during which the bird practices and refines its own song through auditory feedback (comparing its own output to the memorized template) — the HVC and RA brain nuclei control song production while Area X and LMAN are essential for song learning",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Birdsong learning is one of the best-studied examples of vocal learning in animals and has strong parallels to human speech acquisition. In zebra finches (closed-ended learners that crystallize a single song): Sensory (memorization) phase (~days 20-65): The young bird listens to an adult tutor (usually the father) and forms an auditory memory (template) of the song. Isolation during this period results in abnormal song. Cross-fostering demonstrates that the bird preferentially copies its social tutor over audio playback (social influence on learning). Sensorimotor (practice) phase (~days 35-90, overlapping with sensory phase): The bird begins producing subsong (analogous to infant babbling) — variable, quiet, unstructured vocalizations. Through practice with auditory feedback (comparing its own vocalizations to the memorized template), the bird gradually refines its song into plastic song and finally crystallized song (~90 days). Deafening during this phase prevents normal song development. Song system nuclei: HVC (proper name) → RA (robust nucleus of arcopallium) = motor pathway for song production. HVC → Area X → DLM → LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of anterior nidopallium) → RA = anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) essential for song learning and variability. LMAN lesions prevent song learning but not adult song production. FoxP2 (related to human FOXP2 speech gene) is expressed in Area X and is required for normal song learning.",

Over 100 generations, the population stabilizes with ~90% cryptic and ~10% aposematic individuals. What evolutionary mechanisms explain this stable polymorphism?",
      "options": [
        "The polymorphism is maintained by frequency-dependent selection — at low frequency, aposematic moths benefit from predator avoidance learning (predators quickly learn to avoid their warning colors after an unpleasant experience), while at high frequency the cost of initial predator sampling increases proportionally; cryptic moths benefit at high frequency because predators develop a search image, but at low frequency they are found randomly — the equilibrium frequency reflects where the fitness of both strategies is equal",
        "The brightly colored moths survive by random chance and the polymorphism is not stable",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This stable polymorphism illustrates negative frequency-dependent selection, a major mechanism for maintaining behavioral and morphological diversity in populations. The dynamics: Aposematic (warning-colored) moths: (1) At low frequency, they benefit because predators that sample and find them unpalatable quickly form an avoidance memory (one-trial learning in many birds). The 'cost of advertising' (being initially conspicuous) is shared among fewer individuals. (2) As aposematic frequency increases, more naive predators must sample them (larger cost), and the per-capita benefit decreases. (3) Automimicry (palatable mimics of aposematic models) may also evolve at high aposematic frequency. Cryptic moths: (1) At high frequency, predators form search images (cognitive templates optimized for detecting common prey), increasing predation on common cryptic morphs. (2) At low frequency, predators do not develop specific search images, and crypsis is more effective. (3) Apostatic selection (predators disproportionately taking common morphs) stabilizes the polymorphism. Equilibrium: The two strategies have equal fitness at the observed frequencies (~90:10).

Example: male stickleback aggression is triggered by the sign stimulus of a red belly, processed by visual neurons, and executed by specific motor circuits activated by testosterone. (2) Development/Ontogeny — how does the behavior change during the individual's lifetime through maturation, learning, and experience? Example: song learning in birds involves a sensitive period, tutor exposure, and practice. Ultimate (why) questions: (3) Function/Adaptation — what is the current survival or reproductive advantage of the behavior? Addressed through experiments and comparative methods. Example: alarm calling reduces predation on relatives (kin selection). (4) Phylogeny/Evolution — what is the evolutionary history of the behavior? How has it changed across related species? Addressed through phylogenetic comparative analysis. Example: tracing the evolution of courtship displays across duck species. These four questions are complementary, not competing — a complete explanation requires all four. Confusing proximate and ultimate explanations is a common error in behavioral biology.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Eusociality, defined by E.O. Wilson and expanded by subsequent researchers, represents the pinnacle of social evolution. The three defining criteria: (1) Reproductive division of labor — a colony has one or few reproductive individuals (queens, and sometimes kings in termites) while the majority are non-reproductive workers. In extreme cases like honeybees, the queen is the sole egg-layer, while up to 60,000 workers are functionally sterile. (2) Cooperative brood care (alloparenting) — workers collectively raise offspring that are not their own, performing tasks like foraging, nursing, nest defense, and thermoregulation. (3) Overlapping generations — the colony persists across generations, with parents and offspring coexisting as adults, enabling transmission of colony-level adaptations and division of labor. Taxonomic distribution: Eusociality has evolved independently at least 10-15 times. Hymenoptera: all ~20,000 ant species are eusocial, plus some bees (honeybees, stingless bees, some halictid bees) and wasps (Polistes, Vespula). Termites (Blattodea: Termitidae): all ~3,000 species are eusocial, but they are diploid, disproving the hypothesis that haplodiploidy is necessary. Crustacea: snapping shrimp (Synalpheus regalis) — the only known marine eusocial species. Mammalia: naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) and Damaraland mole-rats — the only known eusocial mammals.

      "explanation": "Batesian mimicry (Henry Walter Bates, 1862, studying Amazonian butterflies) is an evolutionary relationship between a palatable mimic and an unpalatable model. The mimic gains protection by resembling the model, which predators have learned to avoid. Conditions for stability: (1) Rarity of mimic — if mimics become too common relative to models, predators encounter mimics frequently, learn that the pattern is often rewarding, and the signal loses its protective value. This creates negative frequency-dependent selection on the mimic. (2) Noxiousness of model — the model must be sufficiently unpleasant (toxic, venomous, bad-tasting) that predators form strong avoidance memories. (3) Predator learning — predators must use visual pattern recognition and generalise their learned avoidance from model encounters to mimic encounters. (4) Spatial overlap — model and mimic must co-occur in the same habitat. Classic examples: Viceroy butterfly (Limenitis archippus) mimicking the Monarch (Danaus plexippus) — though recent work shows viceroys are mildly unpalatable, making this a case between Batesian and Mullerian mimicry. Non-venomous king snakes mimicking coral snakes. Hoverflies mimicking bees/wasps. This contrasts with Mullerian mimicry (Fritz Muller, 1879), where two or more genuinely unpalatable species converge on the same warning pattern, sharing the cost of predator education.",

This isolates train elaboration from other male traits (territory quality, courtship vigor). Petrie and Halliday (1994) performed this experiment. (2) Mate choice trials: Present females with a choice between manipulated and control males in semi-natural enclosures. Measure approach distance, time spent near each male, and copulation frequency. If females prefer enhanced males, this confirms the female preference. (3) Honest signaling test (critical): Cross-foster offspring to control for maternal effects, then measure: (a) Offspring survival to independence. (b) Parasite resistance (measure ectoparasite loads, immune response assays). (c) Growth rate and condition. If sons of males with naturally more elaborate trains have higher fitness, the train is an honest (condition-dependent) signal of genetic quality. (4) Condition-dependence: Test whether males in better nutritional condition grow more elaborate trains, as the handicap principle requires the trait to be costly enough that only high-quality males can maintain it.

      "explanation": "Habituation is a form of non-associative learning in which repeated presentation of a benign stimulus leads to a progressive decrease in response. Eric Kandel (Nobel Prize 2000) elucidated the molecular mechanism using the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia californica: A gentle touch to the siphon normally triggers gill withdrawal through a simple circuit: siphon sensory neurons → motor neurons → gill muscles. With repeated stimulation, the response decreases. The mechanism is presynaptic: (1) Reduced Ca2+ influx into the sensory neuron terminal (fewer voltage-gated Ca2+ channels available). (2) Decreased neurotransmitter (glutamate) release at the sensory-motor synapse. (3) Short-term habituation involves covalent modification of existing proteins; long-term habituation requires protein synthesis and structural changes (reduced synaptic contacts). Key distinctions from sensory adaptation: (a) Sensory adaptation occurs at the receptor level (e.g., Pacinian corpuscle filtering sustained pressure). (b) Habituation occurs at synapses within the neural circuit. (c) Habituation is stimulus-specific — habituated to one stimulus, the animal still responds fully to different stimuli. (d) Dishabituation — a strong or novel stimulus restores the habituated response, proving the sensory pathway is intact. Habituation occurs across all animals with nervous systems, from cnidarians to humans.",

      "explanation": "Amotz Zahavi's handicap principle (1975, formalized mathematically by Grafen 1990) resolves a key problem in sexual selection theory: how can female preference for costly male traits be maintained by selection? Fisher's runaway sexual selection explains how preferences and traits coevolve but does not explain why females benefit. Zahavi proposed: (1) Costly traits are honest signals — a large peacock tail, bright coloration, or elaborate song impose real survival costs (increased predation, energy expenditure, parasites). (2) Only high-quality males can bear these costs — a male with good genes, high nutritional condition, or strong immune function can produce and maintain an elaborate trait while still surviving. A low-quality male cannot; if he produced the trait, the cost would be fatal. (3) Therefore, the trait is an unfakeable signal of quality — females choosing males with elaborate traits are selecting for good genes that will benefit their offspring. This is formally an example of a 'costly signaling' or 'index' signal in animal communication theory. Supporting evidence: (a) Condition-dependent expression: testosterone-dependent ornaments are suppressed by parasites and poor nutrition. (b) Hamilton and Zuk (1982): bright coloration in birds correlates with low parasite loads. (c) Experimental studies: female barn swallows prefer males with longer tail streamers; offspring of long-tailed males have higher survival.

      "explanation": "Bird navigation is one of the most sophisticated orientation systems in the animal kingdom, using at least three compass mechanisms: (1) Sun compass: Birds determine direction from the sun's position, compensated for time of day using their circadian clock. Demonstrated by clock-shift experiments (Kramer, Schmidt-Koenig): advancing the clock by 6 hours shifts the bird's directional choice by ~90°. Young birds must learn the sun's arc. (2) Star compass: Emlen (1967, 1975) showed that indigo buntings learn the night sky's rotational center (celestial pole) during development by observing stellar rotation in a planetarium. Birds raised under a planetarium sky rotating around Betelgeuse oriented as if Betelgeuse were the pole star. This compass is learned, not innate. (3) Magnetic compass: Birds detect Earth's magnetic field (~25-65 µT) using an inclination compass — they sense the angle between the field lines and the horizontal, not polarity (they cannot distinguish magnetic north from south). The leading mechanism involves cryptochrome proteins (Cry1a, Cry4) in the retina, where light-generated radical pairs have spin dynamics sensitive to magnetic field direction. This is disrupted by oscillating magnetic fields in the radiofrequency range. Additionally, a magnetite-based system in the upper beak (trigeminal nerve-innervated) may provide magnetic map information (field intensity) for determining geographic position. These compasses are hierarchically calibrated: the magnetic compass calibrates the star compass, which calibrates the sun compass.",

Payoffs: H vs. H: (V-C)/2 each (negative if C > V). H vs. D: H gets V, D gets 0. D vs. D: V/2 each. If all hawks: average payoff = (V-C)/2 (negative), so dove mutant gets 0 > (V-C)/2 — dove invades. If all doves: average payoff = V/2, but hawk mutant gets V > V/2 — hawk invades. Neither pure strategy is an ESS. Mixed ESS: population plays hawk with probability p = V/C, dove with probability 1 - V/C. At this frequency, hawk and dove have equal fitness, and no invasion is possible.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This classic experimental result directly validates one of the key predictions of Charnov's marginal value theorem (MVT). The MVT predicts that the optimal time to leave a depleting patch is when the instantaneous (marginal) rate of gain drops to the average rate for the entire habitat. The average rate includes: (total food gained across all patches) / (total time including foraging + traveling). When travel time increases: (1) Total time increases for the same amount of foraging. (2) Therefore, the average rate of gain for the habitat decreases. (3) In each patch, the marginal rate of gain starts high and declines as the patch depletes. (4) With a lower average rate to match, the marginal rate takes longer to decline to that level. (5) Therefore, the optimal departure time is later — birds should stay longer in ALL patches. Graphically: the tangent line from the (later) travel time departure point on the x-axis touches the gain curve at a later time, corresponding to more food extracted before leaving. Cowie (1977) elegantly tested this with great tits in an aviary where travel time was manipulated by placing barriers between patches. Results quantitatively matched MVT predictions. The same principle explains why: commuters with longer drives stay at work longer, bees visiting flowers farther from the hive extract more nectar per flower, and bears fishing for salmon spend more time per pool in rivers with widely spaced pools.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Robert Trivers' parental investment theory (1972) provides the fundamental framework for understanding sex differences in mating behavior. Core logic: (1) Parental investment = any investment in an offspring that increases that offspring's survival at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring. (2) The sex with higher obligate parental investment per offspring has a lower potential reproductive rate and becomes the limiting resource for the other sex. (3) The lower-investing sex can increase reproductive success by mating with multiple partners, leading to intense competition for access to the high-investing sex. (4) The high-investing sex benefits from being choosy because each reproductive attempt is costly — choosing a high-quality mate maximizes return on investment. In most mammals: females invest heavily (pregnancy, lactation, parental care), are choosy, and limit male reproductive success. Males invest minimally per offspring, compete intensely (intrasexual selection: fights, displays), and are subject to strong sexual selection producing dimorphism.

      "explanation": "Edward Tolman (1948) first proposed the concept of cognitive maps based on rat maze-learning experiments showing that rats learn spatial relationships, not just stimulus-response chains. Key evidence: (1) Latent learning — rats exploring a maze without reward later find food faster than naive rats, showing they learned the maze layout without reinforcement. (2) Novel shortcuts — rats take shortcuts they have never traversed, requiring knowledge of spatial relationships between locations. Hippocampus and spatial memory: (a) O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) discovered place cells in the hippocampus — neurons that fire only when an animal occupies a specific location (place field). Collections of place cells form a neural map of the environment. John O'Keefe and May-Britt and Edvard Moser (Nobel Prize 2014) identified grid cells in the entorhinal cortex — neurons that fire at multiple locations arranged in a hexagonal grid, providing a metric coordinate system. (b) Morris water maze: hippocampal lesions severely impair rats' ability to find a hidden platform using spatial cues. (c) London taxi drivers (Maguire et al., 2000) have enlarged posterior hippocampi, and the enlargement correlates with years of experience navigating London. (d) Food-caching birds (Clark's nutcracker, black-capped chickadee) have relatively larger hippocampi than non-caching species, and hippocampal volume increases seasonally during caching. (e) Head direction cells in the subiculum and border cells in the entorhinal cortex complement place cells and grid cells to form a complete navigation system.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Signal honesty is crucial for communication systems to be evolutionarily stable. If signals were always dishonest, receivers would evolve to ignore them, collapsing the communication system. Three mechanisms maintain reliability: (1) Cost-based (handicap) signals: The cost of producing or maintaining the signal ensures honesty because the marginal cost of increasing signal intensity is higher for low-quality than high-quality signaler. Examples: carotenoid-based plumage (red/orange/yellow) requires dietary carotenoids that are also used by the immune system — parasitized or poorly-nourished birds cannot produce bright plumage without immune compromise. Testosterone-dependent ornaments suppress immune function (immunocompetence handicap hypothesis). (2) Index signals: Mechanistically linked to the quality being signaled, making them impossible to fake. Body size constrains vocalization frequency (larger larynx → lower formant frequencies in red deer roars). Antler/horn size is limited by body growth and mineralization capacity. Claw size in fiddler crabs is constrained by body size. (3) Social enforcement: Receivers punish detected dishonesty. Paper wasps (Polistes) with experimentally darkened facial patterns (fake dominance signals) receive more aggression from colony mates. Mantis shrimp that have recently molted sometimes display threat signals despite lacking fighting ability (bluffing), but opponents may call the bluff and attack. Social punishment maintains honesty through receiver retaliation. Some systems also maintain honesty through shared interests (alarm calls benefit both caller and related receivers) or through repeated interactions where reputation matters (cleaner fish maintain honesty to retain clients).",

      "explanation": "Classical conditioning (I-R): Pavlov's paradigm where a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g., tone) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US, e.g., food → salivation). After pairing, the CS alone elicits a conditioned response. The animal learns a predictive relationship between stimuli. Neural substrates are well-characterized: amygdala for fear conditioning (tone + shock → freezing), cerebellum (interpositus nucleus) for eyeblink conditioning (tone + airpuff → blink), and nucleus accumbens for appetitive conditioning. Operant conditioning (II-S): Thorndike/Skinner's paradigm where behaviors are modified by their consequences. Positive reinforcement (reward) increases behavior; negative reinforcement (removing aversive stimulus) increases behavior; punishment decreases behavior. The dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway (VTA → nucleus accumbens) signals reward prediction errors (Schultz et al.): dopamine spikes when reward exceeds expectation, driving learning. The dorsal striatum stores learned action-outcome associations. Habituation (III-P): The simplest learning form. Studied extensively by Kandel in Aplysia: repeated siphon stimulation → decreased sensory neuron → motor neuron synaptic transmission due to reduced Ca2+ influx and vesicle depletion at presynaptic terminals. Stimulus-specific and reversible by dishabituation. Insight learning (IV-Q): Wolfgang Kohler (1925) observed that chimpanzees could solve novel problems (reaching suspended bananas) by apparently combining previously learned elements (stacking boxes, using sticks) without trial-and-error. Requires internal mental representation and is seen in corvids, great apes, and possibly dolphins. The neural basis likely involves prefrontal cortex.",

      "explanation": "Seyfarth, Cheney, and Marler's 1980 study is a landmark in animal communication research, demonstrating functionally referential signaling in a non-human primate. Key findings: (1) Three acoustically distinct alarm call types: 'Rraup' (eagle/raptor alarm) — short, low-pitched. 'Bark' (leopard alarm) — loud, tonal. 'Chutter' (snake alarm) — high-pitched, staccato. (2) Predator-specific responses: Eagle alarm → look up, run into dense bush or descend from exposed tree perch. Leopard alarm → climb to thin outer branches of nearest tree (leopards cannot follow). Snake alarm → stand bipedally, scan ground, mob the snake. (3) Critical experiment: Recorded calls played back through hidden speakers in the absence of any predator elicited the appropriate escape response, proving the calls themselves carry predator-type information (functionally referential). (4) Developmental evidence: Infant vervets make alarm calls but initially overgeneralize (eagle alarm for any aerial object, including falling leaves). Adults respond selectively — reinforcing correct calls by looking up and giving their own eagle alarm when an infant correctly calls for a raptor, but not responding to false alarms. This suggests some innate predisposition refined by experience. (5) Audience effects: callers are more likely to give alarms when vulnerable kin are present (kin selection). While remarkable, vervet calls differ from true language: they lack syntax, generativity, and displacement (referring to things not present). Similar referential alarm systems are found in prairie dogs, Diana monkeys, and some bird species.",

      "explanation": "Jerram Brown's (1964) economic defensibility model applies cost-benefit analysis to territorial behavior. The model predicts: (1) Benefits of territoriality: exclusive access to food, mates, or other resources increases the territory holder's fitness. Benefits depend on resource density and quality within the territory. (2) Costs of territoriality: energy spent patrolling boundaries, time lost from foraging or mating, risk of injury from territorial disputes, and increased conspicuousness to predators. (3) Net benefit curve: At low resource density, territories must be very large to provide sufficient resources, making defense costs prohibitive — no territoriality (e.g., desert birds often flock rather than defend territories). At moderate resource density, a defensible territory provides net benefits — optimal conditions for territoriality. At high resource density, the marginal benefit of excluding competitors decreases because resources are superabundant — territoriality breaks down (e.g., some hummingbird species abandon territory defense when flower density is very high). Predictions confirmed by: (a) Golden-winged sunbirds defend nectar-rich flower patches only when nectar is moderately abundant. (b) Territory size decreases with increasing food density (inverse relationship, confirmed in many species). (c) Pied wagtails share territories with satellites when food becomes scarce (cost of defending alone exceeds benefit). (d) Juvenile salmon switch from territorial to schooling behavior as population density increases.

(2) Controlled need: Food deprivation of specific bats creates a predictable need for blood meals. Vampire bats can die within ~60 hours without feeding, so blood-sharing is literally life-saving. (3) Behavioral matrix: Record all blood-sharing events, identifying donor and recipient. (4) Statistical analysis: Use generalized linear mixed models with both relatedness and reciprocity (past sharing by recipient toward the current donor) as predictors, plus control variables (association duration, grooming frequency, roosting proximity). If reciprocity predicts sharing independently of relatedness, reciprocal altruism is supported. (5) Critical test — partner switching: When bats from different colonies (unrelated, no history) are housed together, does sharing develop preferentially with those who reciprocate? Carter and Wilkinson showed that food-sharing relationships develop between previously unfamiliar, unrelated bats and that sharing is predicted by grooming history (building trust through low-cost interactions before costly sharing). (6) Punishment test: Do bats reduce sharing with non-reciprocators? This is expected under reciprocal altruism but not kin selection. Results: Both kin selection and reciprocal altruism contribute, but reciprocity explains sharing between non-relatives.",

(2) The individual that persists longer wins the resource (value V). (3) Both opponents pay a cost proportional to contest duration (cost rate c per unit time). (4) Neither can assess the other's commitment or fighting ability (symmetric contest with no information). The key insight: no fixed persistence time is an ESS. If all individuals persisted for time T, a mutant persisting for T + ε would always win. But if all persisted for T + ε, a mutant could avoid costly contests by giving up at T - ε and winning elsewhere. The mathematical solution: the ESS is a mixed strategy where persistence times are drawn from a negative exponential distribution with mean = V/(2c). Properties: (a) Average contest duration is proportional to resource value and inversely proportional to cost rate. (b) Most contests are short (the mode of an exponential distribution is zero), but some are very long. (c) The probability of winning at any moment is always 50-50 (the memoryless property of exponential distributions). The model has been extended to asymmetric contests (where information about RHP — resource holding potential — is available).

Genes that are good at producing copies of themselves increase in frequency. (2) The vehicle — the organism is the gene's 'survival machine,' an ephemeral entity constructed by genes to propagate themselves. (3) Gene-level selection explains apparent altruism: (a) Kin selection: a gene that causes its carrier to help relatives (who are likely to carry copies of the same gene) increases its frequency even if the carrier's own reproduction is reduced (Hamilton's rule: rB > C). (b) Reciprocal altruism: a gene for helping non-relatives that is reciprocated can increase in frequency in repeated interactions (Trivers' model, tit-for-tat). (c) Green beard effects: theoretically, a gene could produce three effects simultaneously — a recognizable phenotype (green beard), recognition of that phenotype in others, and altruism toward bearers. The fire ant gene Gp-9 may be an example. (4) Apparent group selection effects can usually be explained by individual/gene-level selection.

Types include: (a) Resource defense polygyny — males defend high-quality territories; females choose territories (e.g., pied flycatchers, orange-rumped honeyguides). (b) Female defense polygyny — males directly guard groups of females (elephant seal harems, gorilla one-male groups). (c) Lek polygyny — males aggregate at display sites (leks) where females visit and choose; no resources or parental care offered (sage grouse, birds-of-paradise, Uganda kob). (2) Monogamy: When biparental care is essential (most songbirds — ~90% socially monogamous), when resources are evenly distributed (preventing monopolization), or when EPP is low. However, genetic monogamy is much rarer than social monogamy — extra-pair copulations are common, with ~11% of offspring being extra-pair in socially monogamous birds on average. (3) Polyandry: Rare, occurs when females can increase fitness more by mating with multiple males than by providing parental care. Classical polyandry in jacanas and phalaropes involves sex-role reversal. In cooperative polyandry (dunnocks, Galapagos hawks), multiple males share a female and help raise young.

This creates antagonistic coevolution — an evolutionary arms race between the sexes. Key examples: (1) Seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus): Males have evolved spiny aedeagi (intromittent organs) covered with sclerotized spines that puncture the female reproductive tract during mating. This traumatic insemination: (a) Increases male sperm precedence by stimulating female egg-laying. (b) Reduces female lifespan and remating probability. Females have counter-evolved thicker connective tissue in the reproductive tract. Experimental evolution studies show that populations with enforced monogamy (removing sexual conflict) evolve reduced male harmfulness and increased female lifespan over ~30 generations. (2) Ducks (Anatidae): Males of many species (e.g., Argentine lake duck) have evolved long, spiral phalluses. Females have evolved complex vaginal anatomy with dead-end pouches and clockwise spirals (opposite to the male's counterclockwise phallus), allowing females to control fertilization by relaxing or contracting reproductive tract muscles. (3) Drosophila melanogaster: Male seminal fluid protein Acp70A (sex peptide) increases female egg-laying and decreases her receptivity to remating, but also reduces female lifespan. Females evolve resistance to seminal fluid toxicity.

      "explanation": "Sperm competition (Parker 1970) is a powerful selective force shaping male reproductive biology. Adaptations are diverse: (1) Testis size: Across primates, relative testis size correlates with mating system. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), where females mate with multiple males in quick succession, have very large testes (~0.3% body mass). Gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), where a single silverback monopolizes mating, have small testes (~0.02% body mass). Humans are intermediate. (2) Sperm quantity and quality: Species with intense sperm competition produce more sperm per ejaculate, with higher motility. Passerine birds with higher extra-pair paternity rates have faster-swimming sperm. (3) Seminal fluid proteins: In Drosophila, over 100 accessory gland proteins (Acps) manipulate female physiology — increasing egg-laying, reducing remating receptivity, and displacing previous males' sperm. These proteins evolve rapidly under positive selection. (4) Copulatory plugs: Rodents, many insects, and some primates deposit plugs that physically block subsequent males' sperm. Plug size correlates with sperm competition intensity across rodent species. (5) Sperm removal: Male dragonflies (Calopteryx) have penile structures that physically remove stored sperm from previous matings before depositing their own — the last-male sperm precedence mechanism. (6) Mate guarding: Post-copulatory mate guarding (staying with the female during her fertile period) is common in birds, insects, and primates. (7) Strategic ejaculate allocation: Males adjust ejaculate size based on perceived sperm competition risk (larger ejaculates when a rival male is present).",

      "options": [
        "Because an offspring is related to itself by r = 1 but to its siblings by only r = 0.5 (full siblings), each offspring is selected to demand more investment than the parent is selected to give — the parent, equally related to all its offspring (r = 0.5 each), maximizes fitness by distributing investment among current and future offspring; the offspring benefits from extra investment until the cost to the parent's other offspring (weighted by r = 0.5) exceeds the benefit to itself",
        "Parents and offspring always agree on the optimal level of investment",
        "Parent-offspring conflict exists only in species with exactly two offspring",
        "The conflict arises because offspring want less food, not more"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Robert Trivers (1974) identified a fundamental genetic asymmetry between parent and offspring interests. The logic: (1) From the offspring's perspective: It values itself at r = 1 (it is 100% related to itself) but values each full sibling at r = 0.5. Therefore, an offspring 'wants' more investment from the parent than the parent should optimally provide, because the offspring discounts the cost to siblings by half. (2) From the parent's perspective: The parent is equally related to all offspring (r = 0.5) and maximizes inclusive fitness by allocating investment to produce the greatest total number of surviving offspring. This means weaning the current offspring when the marginal benefit of continued investment is less than the benefit of investing in future offspring. (3) The zone of conflict: When the cost-to-benefit ratio of parental investment (measured in lost future siblings) is between 1 (where the offspring wants to stop) and 2 (where the parent wants to stop — because the offspring weights sibling cost at 0.5). In this zone, additional investment benefits the offspring but reduces the parent's overall fitness. Evidence: (a) Weaning conflict in mammals — offspring cry, beg, and resist weaning; mothers push them away. (b) Sibling rivalry — siblicide in eagles, pelicans, and boobies (first-hatched chick kills younger sibling). (c) Begging behavior in birds — offspring beg more than is honest, escalating when hungrier. (d) Genomic imprinting — paternally expressed genes (e.g., IGF2) promote fetal growth, while maternally expressed genes (e.g., IGF2R) restrict it, reflecting parent-of-origin conflict over resource extraction from the mother.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Animal culture (Whiten et al. 1999, Laland and Galef 2009) is defined as socially learned behavior that is shared within a population and transmitted across generations. Key examples: (1) Japanese macaques: Imo's innovations on Koshima Island included sweet potato washing (1953) and wheat-sifting (throwing sand-wheat mixtures into water, where wheat floats). These behaviors spread non-randomly — first to Imo's close associates and kin, then gradually through the troop. Young individuals and females adopted the behavior faster than adult males. The pattern of spread (S-shaped diffusion curve, social network-biased) rules out independent invention. (2) Chimpanzees: Whiten et al. (1999) documented 39 behavioral variants across seven long-term study sites that cannot be explained by ecological or genetic differences — representing cultural traditions. Examples: ant-dipping technique (Gombe: short sticks, quick withdrawal; Tai: long sticks, slow withdrawal), nut-cracking (West African populations only), and leaf-grooming. (3) New Caledonian crows: Manufacture hooked stick tools and stepped pandanus-leaf tools with regionally distinct designs (tool traditions). Juvenile crows learn tool techniques from parents over an extended dependency period. (4) Cetaceans: Humpback whale song undergoes progressive cultural evolution — new songs originate in one population and spread across the Pacific over 2-3 years. Killer whale populations have distinct vocal dialects maintained through maternal cultural transmission. (5) Social learning mechanisms: local enhancement (attention drawn to location), stimulus enhancement (attention to object), observational conditioning, imitation (copying the motor pattern), and teaching (active tutoring, rare outside humans but documented in meerkats and ants).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cooperative breeding (Emlen 1991, Koenig and Dickinson 2004) has evolved independently in >300 bird species and many mammals (meerkats, wolves, naked mole-rats, marmosets). Explanations: (1) Kin selection: Helpers are usually close relatives of the breeders (offspring from previous years in most cooperatively breeding birds). By helping raise siblings (r = 0.5), they gain indirect fitness. Measured in Florida scrub-jays (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick): helpers increase breeder productivity by ~0.5 extra fledglings per helper. (2) Ecological constraints hypothesis (Emlen 1982): When suitable territories or mates are saturated, floating independently is costly (high mortality, low breeding prospects). Helping while waiting for a territory vacancy yields higher fitness than dispersing into a hostile environment. Supported by: territories created by removing holders are quickly occupied by former helpers; helper frequency increases when habitat is saturated. (3) Benefits of philopatry (Stacey and Ligon 1991): Helpers gain direct benefits: (a) Territory inheritance — helpers may inherit the natal territory when parents die. (b) Skill acquisition — practice at nestling care improves future reproductive competence. (c) Group augmentation — larger groups have lower per-capita predation rates and better territory defense. (4) Pay-to-stay (Gaston 1978, Kokko et al. 2002): Dominant breeders tolerate subordinates only if subordinates contribute to brood care. Experimental evidence in cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher): subordinates that are prevented from helping are evicted by dominants.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Dominance hierarchies (Schjelderup-Ebbe 1922, first described peck orders in chickens) are structured social relationships where individuals differ in competitive ability and priority of access to resources. Determinants of rank: (1) Resource holding potential (RHP, Parker 1974): body size, weaponry, fighting experience, and physiological condition. In red deer, larger stags with bigger antlers win contests. (2) Alliances and coalitions: In many primates (baboons, chimpanzees), coalitions between individuals can override individual RHP. An alpha male chimpanzee often maintains position through alliances with other males rather than individual fighting ability. (3) Prior residency: In many species (e.g., territorial fish), prior residents have an advantage ('owner effect'). (4) Maternal rank inheritance: In cercopithecine monkeys and spotted hyenas, daughters achieve ranks just below their mothers through active support from mothers and other high-ranking group members. Youngest daughters rank above older daughters (youngest ascendancy). Fitness consequences of dominance: Benefits: (a) Priority of access to food — dominant baboons and wolves feed first. (b) Mating access — alpha male chimpanzees sire 30-50% of offspring despite comprising <10% of males. (c) Reduced harassment. Costs: (a) Stress — in some species, dominant individuals have chronically elevated cortisol (e.g., alpha male baboons during unstable hierarchies). (b) Energy expenditure on aggression and territory patrol. (c) Injury risk from challenges. Whether dominance is costly or beneficial depends on species and social system: in cooperative species like meerkats, dominant females (who breed) have lower cortisol than subordinates.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Sinervo and Lively's (1996) study of side-blotched lizards is one of the best documented examples of evolutionary game dynamics in nature. The system: Three genetically determined male throat-color morphs exhibit a non-transitive (rock-paper-scissors) competitive hierarchy: (1) Orange-throated males: Ultra-aggressive, maintain large territories encompassing multiple females. High testosterone levels drive their territorial aggression. They overpower blue males by usurping their small territories. Orange > Blue. (2) Yellow-throated males: Non-territorial, female-mimicking sneakers. Their small size and female coloration allow them to infiltrate the large territories of orange males without being detected. They cannot invade blue male territories because blue males stay close to their single mate. Yellow > Orange. (3) Blue-throated males: Form pair bonds, defend small territories with a single female, and guard their mate closely. Their vigilance allows them to detect and repel yellow sneakers. Blue > Yellow. Frequency-dependent dynamics: When orange is common (has beaten blue), yellow invades (beats orange). When yellow is common, blue invades (beats yellow). When blue is common, orange invades (beats blue). This creates an approximately 6-year cycle in morph frequencies. The genetics: Throat color is determined by alleles at the OBY locus, with orange (o) dominant to blue (b), and yellow (y) a third allele. This system demonstrates: (a) Evolutionary game theory in action (mixed ESS through cycling rather than stable equilibrium). (b) Negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining genetic polymorphism. (c) Alternative reproductive strategies as an ESS. (d) The power of non-transitive competitive interactions (no single 'best' strategy).",

        "The dilution effect predicts that an individual's risk of being taken by a predator decreases as group size increases (probability = 1/N for N group members) — Hamilton's selfish herd theory (1971) extends this by predicting that individuals should minimize their 'domain of danger' (the area closer to them than to any other group member) by moving toward the center of the group, producing the characteristic tight aggregations seen in fish schools, bird flocks, and ungulate herds, where peripheral individuals suffer disproportionately higher predation",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Group living anti-predator benefits involve several overlapping mechanisms: (1) Dilution effect (Foster and Treherne 1981): If a predator attacks a group and takes one individual, each individual's probability of being the victim decreases as 1/N (where N = group size). This provides a passive benefit of grouping even without any cooperative vigilance. It selects for grouping when predator attack rate does not increase proportionally with group size. (2) Selfish herd (Hamilton 1971): Hamilton proposed that prey aggregate not for the good of the group but because each individual selfishly tries to place others between itself and approaching predators. Formally, each individual minimizes its 'domain of danger' — the Voronoi polygon defined as the area closer to that individual than to any neighbor. Central individuals have smaller domains of danger than peripheral ones. This produces: (a) Tight aggregation — individuals pack closely together. (b) Central-marginal gradient — predation risk is higher at group edges. Field evidence: muskox in circular formations with calves in center, pelicans attacked on the periphery of flocks. (3) Many-eyes effect (Pulliam 1973): In larger groups, each individual can spend less time vigilant (scanning for predators) and more time foraging because the collective detection probability is higher. This creates a tension with scramble competition for food. (4) Confusion effect: Predators have difficulty targeting a single individual in a fast-moving group (starling murmurations, fish schools). Oddity effect — unusual individuals in a group are targeted preferentially. Costs of group living: (a) Increased competition for food (scramble and interference). (b) Higher parasite and disease transmission. (c) Increased conspicuousness to predators. (d) Reproductive suppression in subordinates. The optimal group size balances these costs and benefits.",

(4) The forager should maximize the long-term rate of energy intake (E/T). Decision rule: Always eat the most profitable prey type (rank 1). Add the next-ranked prey type to the diet if: λ₁ × e₁ / (1 + λ₁ × h₁) < (λ₁ × e₁ + λ₂ × e₂) / (1 + λ₁ × h₁ + λ₂ × h₂). Key predictions: (a) Zero-one rule — each prey type is either always included or always excluded (no partial preferences). (b) Inclusion depends on the encounter rate with higher-ranked items, NOT on the item's own abundance. If high-rank prey are abundant, the forager should specialize; if rare, the forager should generalize. (c) As high-rank prey become more abundant, low-rank items are dropped from the diet. (d) Adding a new high-rank prey type causes specialization; removing it causes generalization. Experimental support: Shore crabs select mussels of optimal size (maximum profitability); great tits switch from generalist to specialist when large prey encounter rates increase.

When a migratory bird in nocturnal migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) jumps in its preferred direction, its inked feet leave marks on the paper, recording its directional preference without the bird leaving the cage. (2) Helmholtz coil apparatus: Three pairs of coils arranged orthogonally create a uniform artificial magnetic field whose direction and intensity can be precisely controlled independently of Earth's field. (3) Critical manipulation: Rotate the magnetic field direction while keeping all other cues constant (use indoors, control light, block celestial cues). If birds reorient with the shifted field, magnetic compass use is confirmed. Wolfgang Wiltschko (1968) demonstrated this in European robins: when magnetic north was shifted 120° counterclockwise, the birds' preferred direction shifted accordingly. (4) Light-dependency tests: The avian magnetic compass requires short-wavelength (blue-green) light. Under red light (>630 nm), birds cannot orient magnetically, consistent with the cryptochrome radical-pair mechanism in the retina where flavin-tryptophan radical pairs are sensitive to magnetic field direction only when excited by blue/green photons. (5) Radiofrequency disruption: Oscillating magnetic fields in the MHz range (broadband noise) disrupt the radical-pair mechanism, abolishing magnetic orientation (Ritz et al. 2004). This distinguishes the radical-pair compass from a magnetite-based compass (which is not disrupted by RF). Controls: natural magnetic field (positive control), zero field (negative control), and sham-manipulated coils (powered but producing no field shift).",

(2) Free — all individuals are free to move between patches (no despotic exclusion or travel costs). (3) Equal competitors — all individuals are competitively equal. (4) Fitness in a patch decreases with increasing competitor density (density-dependent competition). Prediction: At equilibrium, individuals distribute themselves such that fitness is equalized across all occupied patches. This means: (a) Richer patches attract more individuals, but density-dependent competition reduces per-capita intake. (b) The proportion of individuals in each patch matches the proportion of total resources (input matching). (c) No individual can improve its fitness by moving to another patch (Nash equilibrium). Experimental tests: Milinski (1979) tested IFD with sticklebacks in a tank with two feeding stations delivering Daphnia at different rates (2:1 ratio). Fish distributed themselves approximately 2:1, matching the input ratio. Deviations from IFD: (a) Ideal despotic distribution — dominant individuals exclude subordinates from best patches. (b) Perceptual constraints — animals have incomplete information. (c) Travel costs — moving between patches is not free. (d) Interference competition — aggressive interactions reduce intake in crowded patches more than expected. (e) Unequal competitors — better competitors achieve higher intake in all patches, while poorer competitors are pushed to inferior patches.",

      "options": [
        "Sensory exploitation proposes that male ornamental traits evolve to exploit pre-existing sensory biases in females that originally evolved in non-mating contexts — for example, female water mites (Neumania papillator) are attracted to vibrations resembling their copepod prey, and males evolved to produce similar vibrations during courtship; female swordtail fish (Xiphophorus) prefer males with elongated tail swords, but the preference exists even in species that lack the sword, suggesting the preference predates the trait",

        "Female preferences are always genetically linked to the male trait they prefer",
        "Sensory exploitation only occurs in aquatic organisms"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sensory exploitation hypothesis (Ryan 1990, Endler and Basolo 1998) proposes that female preferences evolve first (for ecological reasons such as foraging, predator avoidance, or species recognition) and male traits subsequently evolve to exploit these pre-existing biases. Key evidence: (1) Water mites (Neumania papillator): Females are predators of copepods and detect prey by vibrations in the water. Males court females by producing vibrations mimicking copepod swimming movements — 'trembling' their legs at frequencies similar to copepod prey. Proctor (1991) showed that females approach male courtship vibrations because they are initially perceived as prey signals. The male trait exploits the female's foraging sensory system. (2) Swordtail fish (Xiphophorus): Males of some species have elongated caudal fin extensions (swords). Females prefer males with swords. Critically, females of Priapella olmecae (a related species whose males have NEVER had swords) also prefer males with experimentally attached artificial swords (Basolo 1990, 1995). This demonstrates that the preference evolved before the trait — phylogenetic analysis confirms the preference is ancestral and the sword is derived. (3) Tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus): Males produce complex calls with a 'whine' (species recognition) plus optional 'chucks.' Females prefer calls with chucks. The chuck stimulates the basilar papilla (BP) of the inner ear, which is tuned to low frequencies for general auditory processing. Males evolved the chuck to exploit this pre-existing tuning. (4) Guppies (Poecilia reticulata): Female preference for orange spots may derive from a foraging preference for orange-colored fruits. The hypothesis differs from Fisherian runaway (where preference and trait coevolve simultaneously) and the good-genes/handicap model (where the preference evolves because it provides fitness information).",

      "options": [
        "Brood parasites (e.g., cuckoos, cowbirds) exploit host parental care — hosts evolve egg recognition and rejection (ejecting foreign eggs or deserting parasitized nests), while parasites counter-evolve increasingly accurate egg mimicry matching host egg color and pattern; the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) has evolved host-specific egg morphs (gens) where each female lineage specializes on one host species, with egg mimicry inherited maternally (likely on the W chromosome in this ZW sex-determination system)",

      "explanation": "Obligate brood parasitism in birds provides one of the best-studied examples of coevolutionary arms races (Davies and Brooke 1989, Kilner and Langmore 2011). The parasites: The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) lays one egg per host nest, and the cuckoo chick evicts all host eggs/chicks within hours of hatching, monopolizing parental care. Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are generalist parasites using >200 host species. Parasite adaptations: (1) Egg mimicry — cuckoo eggs closely match host eggs in color, pattern, and sometimes size. Each female cuckoo belongs to a 'gens' (host race) specializing on one host species. Since sex is ZW in birds, the mimicry locus is likely W-chromosome linked (passed mother to daughter), maintaining host-specific mimicry despite cross-breeding with males from other gentes. (2) Rapid egg-laying (~10 seconds) and removal of one host egg during parasitism. (3) Short incubation period — cuckoo eggs hatch before host eggs, giving the chick a head start. (4) Chick eviction instinct — innate behavior to push eggs/chicks from the nest. Host defenses: (1) Egg recognition and rejection — hosts learn their own egg appearance and reject foreign eggs (ejecting or puncturing them). (2) Nest desertion — abandoning parasitized nests. (3) Mobbing — aggressive attack of adult cuckoos near the nest. (4) Chick recognition — some hosts (superb fairy-wrens) teach embryos a password call that chicks must produce to be fed. The evolutionary outcome depends on the costs and benefits of each strategy. Some hosts (dunnocks) show no egg rejection despite heavy parasitism — possibly because they have not yet evolved recognition, or because the costs of recognition errors (accidentally rejecting own eggs) are too high.",

      "options": [
        "In Fisher's model, a positive feedback loop develops between female preference genes and male trait genes — if females with a preference gene mate with ornamented males, their sons inherit the ornament AND their daughters inherit the preference, creating genetic correlation (linkage disequilibrium) between trait and preference; this self-reinforcing cycle drives both trait and preference to increasingly extreme values until opposed by natural selection costs",

        "Runaway selection only affects body size, not visual ornaments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "R.A. Fisher (1930) proposed the runaway process, later formalized mathematically by Lande (1981) and Kirkpatrick (1982). The mechanism: (1) Initial condition: Some males have a slightly exaggerated trait (e.g., longer tails) that provides a genuine viability advantage (e.g., better aerodynamics) or signals condition. Some females have a preference for this trait. (2) Genetic correlation: Females with the preference gene preferentially mate with males carrying the trait gene. Because Mendelian inheritance combines parental alleles, offspring inherit both: sons carry the trait gene and daughters carry the preference gene. This creates linkage disequilibrium (non-random association) between the two loci. (3) Positive feedback: Ornamented males produce daughters with the preference, who produce ornamented sons — the preference is self-reinforcing because choosing ornamented males increases the attractiveness of sons (sexy sons hypothesis). (4) Runaway: As the preference spreads, the trait becomes more extreme because more females prefer it. As the trait becomes more extreme, the preference intensifies because the benefit of having attractive sons increases. This creates an accelerating feedback loop. (5) Equilibrium: The runaway process is eventually halted when the survival cost of the exaggerated trait equals the mating advantage. The result is a stable equilibrium where the trait is more elaborate than the natural-selection optimum. Key predictions: (a) The genetic correlation between trait and preference should be detectable (confirmed in stalk-eyed flies). (b) Removing the ornament should reduce mating success but increase survival. (c) The process can maintain traits with NO honest signaling function — the ornament is arbitrary. This distinguishes runaway from the handicap/good-genes model.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Altruistic punishment (Fehr and Gachter 2002) is a key mechanism for maintaining cooperation in large groups where repeated interactions and reputation are insufficient: (1) The cooperation problem: In public goods scenarios, the rational individual strategy is to free-ride (benefit from others' contributions without paying). This leads to the 'tragedy of the commons' where cooperation collapses. (2) Punishment as a solution: If cooperators can punish defectors (at a cost to themselves), the expected cost of free-riding exceeds the benefit, deterring cheating. The punishment is 'altruistic' because the punisher pays a cost to benefit the group. (3) Experimental evidence: Fehr and Gachter's public goods game with punishment: when participants can spend money to reduce free-riders' earnings, cooperation stabilizes at high levels. Without punishment, cooperation declines to near zero over rounds. This occurs even in one-shot, anonymous games where reputation effects and future reciprocity are excluded. (4) Evolution of punishment: How can costly punishment evolve if punishers bear the cost? Possible explanations: (a) Strong reciprocity — a bundle of cooperative tendencies including punishment that coevolved with human ultrasociality. (b) Second-order free-rider problem — who punishes the non-punishers? Solved if punishment is cheap relative to the cooperation benefit, or if non-punishers are also punished. (c) Cultural group selection — groups with punishers outcompete groups without. (5) Animal examples: Cleaner fish clients punish cheating cleaners by chasing them; dominant meerkats punish subordinates that attempt to breed; policing in social insects (workers destroy eggs laid by other workers, maintaining queen monopoly on reproduction).",

        "A greenbeard gene must produce three effects: (1) a recognizable phenotypic tag (the 'green beard'), (2) the ability to recognize the same tag in others, and (3) altruistic behavior directed specifically toward individuals bearing the tag — this allows a gene to spread by helping copies of itself in other individuals regardless of overall relatedness; the fire ant Gp-9 gene and the csA gene in Dictyostelium social amoebae are candidate examples",
        "The greenbeard effect requires all three components: green coloration, facial hair, and aggressive behavior",
        "Greenbeard genes only need to produce a visible tag; recognition and altruism are provided by separate genes",
        "The greenbeard effect has been proven impossible and no real examples exist"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The greenbeard concept (named by Dawkins 1976, based on Hamilton's 1964 suggestion) describes a single gene (or tightly linked gene complex) that: (1) Produces a recognizable phenotype — a conspicuous marker ('green beard') that identifies carriers to each other. (2) Enables recognition — carriers can detect the marker in other individuals. (3) Directs altruism — carriers behave altruistically toward other individuals bearing the marker. This bypasses the need for kinship: the gene helps copies of itself directly, regardless of genome-wide relatedness. Hamilton's rule still applies but r refers to the probability of sharing the greenbeard allele specifically, not average genome relatedness. Real candidates: (a) Fire ant Gp-9 gene (Keller and Ross 2004): Workers carrying the Gp-9b allele kill queens that lack it (i.e., are homozygous Gp-9B/Gp-9B). The Gp-9b allele affects cuticular hydrocarbon profiles (the phenotypic tag), recognition of that profile, and the killing behavior. (b) FLO1 gene in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae): Produces a cell-surface flocculin protein (tag) that causes cells to aggregate preferentially with other FLO1+ cells (recognition + cooperation through group protection). (c) csA gene in Dictyostelium discoideum: Encodes a cell adhesion molecule; csA+ cells preferentially aggregate with other csA+ cells during fruiting body formation, gaining a fitness advantage. Challenges: Greenbeard genes are vulnerable to 'falsebeards' — cheaters that display the tag but do not cooperate. This creates selection for increasingly specific recognition mechanisms. Most proposed greenbeard genes involve linked gene complexes rather than single genes with pleiotropic effects.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Theory of mind (Premack and Woodruff 1978) is one of the most intensely debated topics in comparative cognition. Evidence: (1) Chimpanzees — competitive paradigms: Hare et al. (2000, 2001) placed food between a subordinate and a dominant chimpanzee. When the food was visible to both, the subordinate avoided it. When the food was hidden behind a barrier visible only from the subordinate's side, the subordinate approached it. This suggests the subordinate understands the dominant's visual perspective. (2) Chimpanzees — helping: Chimpanzees hand a human an out-of-reach object the human is reaching for, even when the object is of no value to the chimp — suggesting understanding of the human's goal/desire. (3) Western scrub-jays (Clayton and colleagues): Jays that have personally experienced pilfering others' caches take anti-pilfering measures (re-caching when observed, moving caches to new locations after being watched). Jays that have never stolen others' caches do not re-cache. This 'experience projection' — attributing one's own knowledge to others — is a component of ToM. (4) False belief test: The gold standard for ToM in children (Sally-Anne task). Results in great apes are mixed and controversial. Krupenye et al. (2016) used eye-tracking to show that apes look anticipatorily toward where a human will search based on the human's false belief, but whether this represents true belief attribution or learned behavioral prediction remains debated. The central challenge: Morgan's canon (prefer the simplest explanation) means behavioral-rule explanations (learned associations between cues and outcomes) must be excluded before inferring mental-state attribution.

      "explanation": "Play behavior (Burghardt 2005; Pellis and Pellis 2009) is defined by five criteria: (1) Not fully functional in the context performed. (2) Spontaneous, voluntary, and pleasurable. (3) Differs structurally or temporally from serious behavior (exaggerated movements, role reversals). (4) Performed repeatedly. (5) Occurs when the animal is healthy, well-fed, and unstressed. Categories: (a) Locomotor/rotational play — running, jumping, spinning (seen in young ungulates, primates, corvids). (b) Object play — manipulating objects without a clear functional goal (otters with stones, dolphins with bubbles). (c) Social play — play fighting, chasing, wrestling with conspecifics (includes self-handicapping, role reversal, play signals like the canid play bow). Hypothesized functions: (1) Motor training: Practice refines neuromuscular coordination. Juvenile rats deprived of play have less developed motor cortex and are poorer at adult social behaviors. Kittens' play sequences contain elements of adult hunting (stalk, pounce, bite). (2) Social competence: Play fighting teaches bite inhibition, reading social signals, negotiation of dominance, and cooperation. Animals deprived of social play (isolation-reared) show social deficits as adults. (3) Cognitive flexibility: Spinka et al.'s (2001) 'training for the unexpected' hypothesis suggests play deliberately creates unpredictable situations (loss of balance, unexpected partner responses), training the brain to cope with sudden changes — enhancing behavioral flexibility. (4) Physical conditioning: Play provides cardiovascular exercise during development. The costs of play (energy expenditure ~2-15% of daily budget, risk of injury ~0.5-5% of play sessions, increased predation risk) suggest the benefits must be substantial for play to be maintained by selection.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Testosterone (T) is a central hormone in behavioral endocrinology, with both organizational and activational effects: Organizational effects (during development): (a) Sexual differentiation of the brain — in mammals, prenatal T exposure masculinizes brain structures including the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA, larger in males), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and amygdala. (b) These structural differences underlie sex-typical behavioral patterns in adulthood. (c) In birds, estrogen (aromatized from T) is the primary masculinizing hormone for brain sexual differentiation. Activational effects (in adults): (a) Aggression — T facilitates territorial aggression in most vertebrates. Castrated male birds reduce territorial singing and aggression; T implants restore it. (b) Courtship — T drives courtship displays, singing (in songbirds, T stimulates HVC and RA song nuclei), and mating behavior. (c) Dominance — T often correlates with social rank, though causality is bidirectional (winning fights increases T). The challenge hypothesis (Wingfield et al. 1990): In seasonally breeding birds, T rises to breeding baseline levels during the reproductive season but spikes further only during social challenges (territorial intrusions, mate guarding). This explains why: (a) Species with frequent challenges (polygynous, colonial) have higher T. (b) Species with extensive paternal care have lower baseline T (high T suppresses paternal behavior). (c) Chronic high T is costly: immunosuppression (via reduced lymphocyte function), increased metabolic rate, and greater predation risk from conspicuous behavior. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (Folstad and Karter 1992) connects T to honest signaling: T promotes ornament expression but suppresses immunity, so only healthy males can afford high T.",

Features: bright, conspicuous colors (red, orange, yellow, often with black), high contrast patterns, and often coupled with gregarious behavior (amplifying the signal). Examples: poison dart frogs (Dendrobatidae) with alkaloid toxins, coral snakes with neurotoxic venom, monarch butterflies with cardiac glycosides from milkweed. Predators learn through one-trial or few-trial aversive experiences to avoid the signal. Mullerian mimicry (II-P): Fritz Muller (1879) showed that two or more genuinely unpalatable species benefit from converging on the same warning pattern. The selective advantage: predators need only learn one pattern to avoid all species sharing it, reducing the number of prey killed during predator education. The per-capita cost of 'educating' naive predators is shared among all mimicry ring members. Examples: various neotropical Heliconius butterfly species share wing patterns in local mimicry rings. Crypsis (III-R): Background matching through color, pattern, body shape, and behavior. Types include: (a) General background matching (peppered moth Biston betularia). (b) Disruptive coloration — high-contrast patterns that break up the body outline. (c) Countershading — darker dorsal, lighter ventral surface, eliminating the shadow that reveals 3D shape. (d) Masquerade — resembling an inedible object (stick insects, leaf-mimicking katydids). Many cryptic species also use behavioral crypsis (remaining motionless, aligning with background patterns). Startle display (IV-Q): Deimatic behavior — sudden revelation of hidden conspicuous features when a predator approaches. Examples: owl butterfly hindwing eyespots, praying mantis threat display (spreading forelegs to reveal bright patches), hawkmoth caterpillar inflating 'snake-head' thorax. The momentary startle buys time for escape. Most effective against naive or cautious predators.",

      "explanation": "Nuptial gifts (Vahed 1998, Lewis and South 2012) are widespread in insects, spiders, and some birds: Types of nuptial gifts: (a) Prey items — male scorpionflies (Panorpa) and hangingflies (Bittacus) capture arthropod prey and present them to females during courtship. In Hylobittacus apicalis, females accept mating only if the prey exceeds a minimum size (~16 mm²); copulation duration and sperm transfer increase with prey size. (b) Spermatophylax — a protein-rich, non-sperm portion of the spermatophore in bushcrickets (Tettigoniidae) and Mormon crickets (Anabrus simplex). The female eats the spermatophylax while sperm transfer occurs from the attached sperm ampulla. Males benefit because the longer the female takes to eat the gift, the more sperm are transferred. (c) Glandular secretions — male fireflies (Photinus) transfer seminal gifts with nutrients and defensive compounds (lucibufagins). Male bushcrickets produce gifts constituting up to 40% of body mass. (d) Nuptial feeding in birds — male terns offer fish to females during courtship, signaling foraging ability. Adaptive functions: (1) Mate attraction and acceptance — females preferentially mate with gift-giving males. (2) Extended copulation — gift consumption occupies the female, allowing more sperm transfer. (3) Direct nutritional benefit — nutrients in gifts are incorporated into eggs, increasing clutch size. (4) Manipulation/deception — some males offer worthless gifts: male nursery-web spiders (Pisaura mirabilis) sometimes wrap inedible items in silk; females that detect the deception terminate mating sooner. Sexual conflict: The spermatophylax represents a conflict — males benefit from maximal sperm transfer, but females may benefit from eating the spermatophylax quickly (gaining nutrients) and re-mating with another male sooner. In some katydids, spermatophylax size has increased evolutionarily as a male counter-adaptation to female consumption speed.",

      "explanation": "Locust phase polyphenism (Pener and Simpson 2009, Rogers et al. 2003) is one of the most dramatic examples of environmentally induced behavioral change: Solitaria phase (low density): (a) Cryptic coloration (green/brown). (b) Avoidance of conspecifics. (c) Low locomotor activity. (d) Solitary foraging. (e) No migratory behavior. Gregaria phase (high density): (a) Aposematic coloration (black-and-yellow). (b) Strong attraction to conspecifics (aggregation). (c) High locomotor activity and marching behavior. (d) Formation of massive migratory swarms (billions of individuals covering 100+ km²). (e) Polyphagy (broader diet). The transition mechanism: (1) Tactile stimulation — crowding increases physical contact, particularly stimulation of mechanoreceptors on the hind femora (back legs). This is the primary proximate trigger. (2) Serotonin — Anstey et al. (2009) showed that serotonin levels in the thoracic ganglia increase within hours of crowding. Serotonin injection into solitary locusts induces gregarious behavior. Serotonin synthesis inhibitors block the phase change. (3) The transition involves epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, histone modification) that alter gene expression across hundreds of genes affecting nervous system, metabolism, and pigmentation. (4) Maternal effects — gregarious mothers produce gregarious offspring even in isolation (trans-generational effects mediated by egg gregarizing factor). Other examples: (a) Honey bee castes — queen vs. worker is a nutritional polyphenism (royal jelly diet triggers queen development). (b) Aphid wing polyphenism — crowding induces winged (alate) morphs that disperse. (c) Daphnia defensive morphology — predator chemical cues induce helmets and neck spines.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Teaching in animals (Caro and Hauser 1992, Thornton and McAuliffe 2006) is rigorously defined by three criteria: (1) The tutor modifies its behavior ONLY in the presence of naive individuals (not performing the same behavior when alone or with experienced individuals). (2) The modification is costly to the tutor (time, energy, or risk). (3) The modification results in faster or more efficient learning by the pupil. Thornton and McAuliffe (2006) demonstrated teaching in meerkats: Observations: (a) Helper meerkats bring prey items to pups, with the difficulty graded by pup age: very young pups (~30 days) receive dead scorpions; older pups (~60 days) receive disabled scorpions (stinger removed by biting); near-independent pups (~90 days) receive intact live scorpions. (b) Helpers were observed nudging escaped prey back toward pups. (c) This graduated curriculum was not random — playback experiments using young pup begging calls caused helpers to bring easier prey, while older pup calls elicited harder prey. Experimental tests: (a) Playback manipulation: By broadcasting begging calls of different-aged pups, researchers showed that helpers adjust prey difficulty in response to perceived pup age (ruling out direct assessment of pup competence). (b) Cost documentation: Helpers spent time disabling prey and sometimes lost prey items while demonstrating handling. (c) Learning outcome: Pups exposed to the graduated curriculum developed scorpion-handling skills faster. This study provided the first experimentally supported case of teaching in a wild non-human animal, meeting all three of Caro and Hauser's criteria. Other proposed examples: tandem running in ants (Temnothorax), vocal tutoring in superb fairy-wrens (embryonic call teaching).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The producer-scrounger (PS) game (Barnard and Sibly 1981, Vickery et al. 1991, Giraldeau and Caraco 2000) applies frequency-dependent game theory to social foraging: The setup: In a group of N foragers, each individual at every opportunity can either: (a) Produce — search independently for food, paying a search cost, and discovering patches at some rate. (b) Scrounge — do not search independently but instead exploit (join) patches discovered by producers. Frequency dependence: If S = number of scroungers and P = number of producers (P + S = N): (a) Producer payoff: proportional to P (fewer competing searchers, more likely to find food) but decreasing in S (more scroungers join each discovery). (b) Scrounger payoff: proportional to P (more producers = more discoveries to exploit) but decreasing in S (more scroungers compete at each discovery). At equilibrium: producer and scrounger payoffs are equal, and neither strategy can invade the other. Key parameters: (1) Finder's share (a) — the proportion of a discovered patch that the producer can consume before scroungers arrive. Higher finder's share favors producing. If a = 1 (producer consumes everything), no scrounging. If a = 0 (all food shared equally), only scrounging. (2) Group size — larger groups favor scrounging because more producers create more opportunities. (3) Patch divisibility — easily shared patches favor scrounging; monopolizable patches favor producing. Experimental evidence: House sparrows in flocks: some individuals consistently produce while others scrounge. Scrounger frequency increases with group size and decreases with finder's share (e.g., increasing inter-seed distance in grid experiments). Dominant individuals often scrounge more (they can displace producers from patches). The PS game predicts that obligate scrounging reduces group foraging efficiency because scroungers contribute nothing to search effort — a social foraging version of the free-rider problem.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Leks (Hoglund and Alatalo 1995) are aggregations of displaying males where females visit primarily to mate, and males provide no parental care or resources beyond sperm. Examples: sage grouse, birds-of-paradise, peacocks, many tropical manakins, Uganda kob, hammer-headed bats. Features: (a) Extreme sexual selection — typically 10-20% of males achieve 70-90% of matings. (b) Pronounced sexual dimorphism — males are highly ornamented. Hypotheses for lek formation: (1) Hotspot model (Bradbury 1981): Males settle at locations where female home ranges overlap ('hotspots'), maximizing the number of females encountered. Prediction: lek location should correlate with female density or movement patterns. (2) Hotshot model (Beehler and Foster 1988): Less attractive males cluster around a highly attractive 'hotshot' male, intercepting some females attracted by the hotshot. Prediction: removing the hotshot should cause the cluster to dissolve or reform around the next most attractive male. (3) Female preference model (Bradbury 1981): Females prefer to mate at larger aggregations because: (a) easier comparison of multiple males, (b) reduced predation risk during mate assessment, (c) reduced per-capita harassment from males. The lek paradox (Kirkpatrick and Ryan 1991): Strong directional female choice should deplete additive genetic variance in male quality, yet females continue to show preferences. Resolutions: (a) Condition-dependent expression — ornament expression depends on environmental and genetic quality across many loci (genic capture). (b) Mutation-selection balance — harmful mutations continuously introduce genetic variance. (c) Fluctuating selection — varying environmental pressures maintain genetic diversity.

      "options": [
        "This demonstrates that the neural distribution of oxytocin receptors, rather than the amount of oxytocin itself, determines species differences in social bonding behavior — the nucleus accumbens is part of the dopaminergic reward pathway, and OTR expression there links social interaction with reward, creating partner-specific attachment; this is a proximate mechanism (Tinbergen's causation level) explaining behavioral differences between species through receptor expression patterns rather than differences in the neuropeptide itself",

      "explanation": "The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) / montane vole (Microtus montanus) comparison (Young et al. 1999, Lim et al. 2004) is a landmark study in behavioral neuroendocrinology demonstrating how receptor distribution patterns create behavioral differences: The system: Prairie voles are socially monogamous — forming long-term pair bonds, sharing a nest, biparental care, and selective aggression toward unfamiliar conspecifics after bonding. Montane voles are promiscuous — no pair bonds, females raise pups alone. Key findings: (1) Oxytocin receptor (OTR) distribution: Prairie voles have high OTR density in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc, reward center) and prefrontal cortex (PFC, decision-making). Montane voles have low OTR in these regions but similar levels elsewhere. (2) Vasopressin receptor (V1aR) distribution: Prairie vole males have high V1aR in the ventral pallidum (reward-related region). Montane voles have low V1aR there. (3) Viral vector experiments (Lim et al. 2004): Injecting a viral vector expressing the V1aR gene into the ventral pallidum of montane voles increased partner preference and pair-bonding behavior. Similarly, increasing OTR in the NAcc enhanced social bonding. (4) Mechanism: Mating releases oxytocin (females) and vasopressin (males). When receptors are present in reward circuitry (NAcc/ventral pallidum), the social stimulus (partner) becomes associated with dopamine-mediated reward. This creates a conditioned partner preference — essentially, the brain 'rewards' the animal for being with its specific partner. (5) Genetic basis: The V1aR gene (avpr1a) has a microsatellite repeat in its promoter in prairie voles but not montane voles. The repeat length affects receptor expression levels in the brain. This illustrates how a regulatory genetic change (not a protein-coding change) can produce major behavioral differences between closely related species.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Taxis and kinesis represent two fundamental orientation strategies, differing in whether the animal orients its body relative to the stimulus: Taxis (directed orientation): (1) Positive taxis — movement toward the stimulus. Positive phototaxis in moths approaching light (though the mechanism is actually a navigational error related to transverse orientation to distant light sources). Positive chemotaxis in bacteria swimming up chemical gradients. (2) Negative taxis — movement away from the stimulus. Negative phototaxis in cockroaches fleeing light. Negative geotaxis in fly larvae climbing upward. (3) Types by mechanism: (a) Klinotaxis — comparison of stimulus intensity over time by swinging the head side to side (Drosophila larvae navigating odor gradients). (b) Tropotaxis — simultaneous comparison of stimulus intensity at two bilateral sensors (planarian orientation toward light using paired eyespots). (c) Telotaxis — orientation directly toward the stimulus using a single sensor (bee flying toward a food source). Kinesis (undirected response): (1) Orthokinesis — movement speed changes with stimulus intensity. Planaria move faster in bright light, slower in dim light, accumulating in dark areas. (2) Klinokinesis — turning rate changes with stimulus intensity. Woodlice (Porcellio scaber) turn more frequently in dry conditions and less in humid conditions. Over time, they aggregate in humid microhabitats — not because they detect the direction to moisture, but because they effectively get 'trapped' in favorable areas (high turning in bad areas + low turning in good areas = accumulation). The adaptive value of kinesis is that it requires minimal neural processing — no directional computation needed — making it effective for animals with simple nervous systems navigating simple gradients.",

The hook enables extraction of grubs from wood holes and crevices. (2) Stepped pandanus-leaf tools — crows make a series of tears and cuts in the tough leaves of pandanus trees, creating a tapered, stepped strip tool. The stepped design varies among regions, suggesting cultural transmission of tool designs (analogous to human material culture). (3) Thorn tools — using cactus spines as probes. Cognitive sophistication: (a) Metatool use — in laboratory experiments, crows use a short tool to retrieve a longer tool, which they then use to access food (sequential tool use requiring planning).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Supernormal stimuli (Tinbergen 1951) provide fundamental insights into how animal nervous systems process sensory information: Classic examples: (1) Herring gull chick pecking: Chicks peck at the red spot on the parent's bill to solicit regurgitation. Tinbergen and Perdeck (1950) showed that a thin red rod with three white bands (supernormal stimulus) elicits more pecking than a realistic gull bill model. The chick's neural system responds to specific features (contrast, length, redness) with a monotonically increasing response function. (2) Egg retrieval: Oystercatchers presented with a choice between their own egg and a giant artificial egg attempt to incubate the giant egg. Greylag geese similarly prefer oversized eggs. (3) Stickleback aggression: Males show more intense aggression toward models with exaggerated red undersides than toward realistic models. (4) Reed warbler cuckoo chick: Cuckoo chicks have an exceptionally wide, brightly colored gape that supernormally stimulates host feeding behavior — host parents preferentially feed the cuckoo over their own chicks. What this reveals: (a) Animal sensory/perceptual systems are tuned to specific stimulus features (sign stimuli or key stimuli) rather than holistic perception. (b) Neural response functions for these features are often open-ended — not capped at natural stimulus values. (c) Natural signals are therefore not at the maximum of the receiver's response function. Why? Possible constraints: production costs, predator detection risk, aerodynamic costs (bird ornaments), or signal honesty constraints. (d) This open-ended sensory bias is what makes sensory exploitation possible in sexual selection — male ornaments evolve to exploit pre-existing sensory tuning. Relevance to human behavior: Deirdre Barrett (2010) argued that modern phenomena like junk food, pornography, and social media exploit supernormal stimulus responses in the human brain.",

      "explanation": "Eric Kandel's work on Aplysia californica gill-withdrawal reflex sensitization (Nobel Prize 2000) revealed the molecular basis of this non-associative learning: The circuit: Siphon touch → siphon sensory neurons → motor neurons → gill muscle contraction. After a strong aversive stimulus (e.g., tail shock), subsequent mild siphon touches elicit enhanced gill withdrawal (sensitization). The mechanism (presynaptic facilitation): (1) Tail shock activates facilitating interneurons that synapse onto the presynaptic terminals of siphon sensory neurons. (2) Facilitating interneurons release serotonin (5-HT). (3) 5-HT binds to G-protein-coupled receptors (Gs) on the sensory neuron terminal. (4) Gs activates adenylyl cyclase → increased cyclic AMP (cAMP). (5) cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA). (6) PKA phosphorylates voltage-gated K+ channels (S-type K+ channels) → channels close → prolonged action potential → more Ca2+ enters through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels → more glutamate released per action potential. Short-term sensitization (minutes to hours): Involves covalent modifications (phosphorylation) of existing proteins. No new gene expression needed. Long-term sensitization (days to weeks): (7) Persistent PKA activation → PKA catalytic subunits translocate to the nucleus. (8) PKA phosphorylates CREB-1 (cAMP response element binding protein, an activator) and relieves repression by CREB-2 (a repressor). (9) CREB-1 activates target genes, including ubiquitin hydrolase (which degrades the regulatory subunit of PKA, making PKA constitutively active) and growth factors. (10) New synaptic connections grow between sensory and motor neurons — the number of synaptic varicosities increases from ~1,300 to ~2,700 (Bhatt et al. 1991).

      "explanation": "Sexual imprinting (Immelman 1972, ten Cate and Vos 1999) is a critical process linking early experience to adult reproductive behavior: Comparison with filial imprinting: (1) Timing: Filial imprinting occurs very early (first hours to days post-hatching) and determines parent-following behavior. Sexual imprinting occurs during a later, broader sensitive period (varies by species; in zebra finches, approximately days 30-65 post-hatching) and determines adult mate preferences. (2) Expression: Filial imprinting is expressed immediately (the chick follows the imprinted object). Sexual imprinting is stored and expressed much later at sexual maturity. (3) Stability: Both are relatively stable once formed, though sexual imprinting can sometimes be partially modified by later experience. Cross-fostering evidence: (a) Zebra finches raised by Bengalese finch foster parents preferentially court Bengalese finches as adults (Immelmann 1972). (b) Male zebra finches are more strongly sexually imprinted on their mother (opposite-sex parent), while females are imprinted on their father. (c) Snow geese — goslings raised with a different color morph (white or blue) preferentially mate with that morph as adults. (d) Great tits cross-fostered by blue tits initially prefer blue tits but can be re-imprinted through experience with conspecifics. Adaptive significance: (a) Species recognition — ensures mating with conspecifics. (b) Optimal outbreeding — imprinting on parents creates a template for 'familiar but slightly different,' promoting mating with moderately related individuals (avoiding both inbreeding and extreme outbreeding). (c) In brood parasites — cuckoo chicks do NOT sexually imprint on host parents; instead, they recognize conspecifics through innate mechanisms, preventing maladaptive interspecific mating.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The starvation-predation trade-off (Lima and Dill 1990, McNamara and Houston 1986) is fundamental to understanding foraging behavior: The core trade-off: Foraging provides energy (reducing starvation risk) but often increases exposure to predators (increasing predation risk). The optimal resolution depends on the animal's energetic state: (1) Asset protection principle: Well-fed animals ('asset-rich') have much to lose and little to gain from risky foraging → they are cautious. Hungry animals ('asset-poor') face starvation → the marginal value of food is high, so they accept higher predation risk. (2) Experimental evidence: (a) Great tits (Parus major) with experimentally reduced fat reserves (through overnight food deprivation) use riskier feeding sites (exposed platforms) more than control birds (Gosler et al. 1995). (b) Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in poor body condition approach predator models more closely while foraging than guppies in good condition. (c) Elk reduce foraging time and increase vigilance in habitats with wolf scent, but increase foraging (accepting risk) when nutritionally stressed. (d) Juvenile salmon in poor condition spend more time foraging in risky open water. (3) Dynamic state variable models (SDP): These models calculate the optimal behavioral decision at each time step as a function of the animal's current energy reserves, environmental conditions, and time remaining until some critical event (nightfall, winter). They predict: (a) Body mass regulation — animals maintain a target fat reserve that balances starvation protection against the mass-dependent costs of predation risk (heavier = slower escape). (b) Diel foraging patterns — birds gain mass during the day and lose it overnight; optimal dawn mass depends on predation risk and food predictability.",

      "options": [
        "The sexual selection hypothesis for infanticide (Hrdy 1974) proposes that incoming males kill unrelated infants because: (1) lactating females are not ovulating (lactational amenorrhea), so killing the infant causes the female to resume cycling sooner; (2) the male gains mating access to the female weeks to months earlier than if the infant survived; (3) the male is not the father and therefore suffers no fitness cost from the infant's death — this has been documented in langur monkeys, lions, bears, rodents, and gorillas, and females have evolved counter-strategies including promiscuity (paternity confusion), abortion of pregnancies by new males (Bruce effect), and coalitionary defense",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sexual selection hypothesis for infanticide (Sarah Blaffer Hrdy 1974, studying Hanuman langurs) is one of the most empirically supported explanations: The logic: (1) In species where a new male takes over a group (lions, langurs, gorillas), the resident females are often nursing infants sired by the previous male. (2) Lactation suppresses ovulation (lactational amenorrhea), so the new male cannot breed with these females for months. (3) By killing the infants, the male: (a) eliminates offspring he did not sire (no genetic cost to him). (b) Causes females to resume ovulation within days to weeks. (c) The male then mates and sires his own offspring. Evidence: (a) Lions (Packer and Pusey 1983): New coalition males kill cubs <2 years old after taking over a pride. Females resume cycling ~4 months after cub loss vs. ~2 years if cubs survive. Males commit infanticide only on cubs they did not sire (DNA paternity analysis confirms). (b) Langurs (Borries et al. 1999): 36% of infant mortality in Hanuman langur populations is due to infanticide by immigrant males. (c) Gorillas, bears, dolphins, rodents — similar patterns. Female counter-strategies: (1) Promiscuity/multi-male mating — by mating with multiple males, females create paternity uncertainty, reducing the probability that any male will commit infanticide (he might be killing his own offspring). (2) Bruce effect — female mice abort pregnancies when exposed to the scent of a strange male, avoiding the energetic waste of carrying offspring that will likely be killed. (3) Coalitionary defense — female langurs and lions cooperate to defend infants against infanticidal males. (4) Concealed ovulation — reduces male certainty about paternity timing. (5) Accelerated development — in some primates, females under infanticide risk mature faster or have shorter interbirth intervals.",

      "explanation": "Hawk-Dove game (I-S): Maynard Smith and Price (1973). Two strategies: Hawk (always escalate, fight to win or injury) and Dove (display, retreat if opponent escalates). Neither pure strategy is an ESS when cost of fighting (C) exceeds resource value (V). The mixed ESS: play Hawk with probability p = V/C. At this frequency, both strategies have equal expected payoff. Predicts: more escalation when resources are valuable (high V), less when fighting is costly (high C). The game explains why most contests are ritualized with actual fighting being relatively rare. War of attrition (II-Q): Maynard Smith (1974). In symmetric contests where opponents cannot assess each other's quality, the ESS is a random persistence time drawn from a negative exponential distribution with mean V/(2c), where c is cost per unit time. No fixed time is stable because any fixed strategy can be beaten by persisting slightly longer. Predicts highly variable contest durations with many short contests and occasional very long ones. Producer-Scrounger game (III-R): Barnard and Sibly (1981). In social foraging groups, individuals choose between finding food independently (producing) and exploiting others' discoveries (scrounging). Negative frequency-dependent selection creates a stable equilibrium: when most produce, scrounging pays; when most scrounge, producing pays. The equilibrium scrounger proportion increases with group size and decreases with the finder's share (proportion of a patch consumed before scroungers arrive). Prisoner's dilemma (IV-P): The single-play PD favors mutual defection, but the iterated PD (repeated interactions) allows cooperation to evolve. Axelrod's tournaments showed that tit-for-tat (cooperate first, then copy opponent's last move) is robust because it is nice, retaliatory, and forgiving. Biological analog: reciprocal altruism (Trivers 1971) — cooperation between non-relatives maintained through repeated interactions and punishment of cheaters.",

        "Task allocation in social insect colonies emerges from individual response thresholds: each worker has an internal threshold for responding to task-related stimuli (e.g., brood pheromone concentration, refuse accumulation), and workers with the lowest threshold for a given task perform it first — as task demand increases (stimulus intensity rises), workers with progressively higher thresholds are recruited; age polyethism (temporal castes) arises because thresholds change systematically with age, producing a predictable sequence: young bees do in-hive tasks (cell cleaning, nursing) and older bees do outside tasks (guarding, foraging)",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Self-organization in social insect colonies (Bonabeau et al. 1997, Beshers and Fewell 2001, Robinson 1992) achieves complex colony-level organization without centralized control: Response threshold model (Bonabeau et al. 1996): (1) Each task has an associated stimulus (e.g., amount of refuse, brood pheromone levels, returning forager dance vigor). (2) Each worker has a response threshold for each stimulus — the stimulus level at which the worker begins performing that task. (3) Thresholds vary among workers (due to age, genotype, experience). (4) When stimulus levels are low (low demand), only workers with the lowest thresholds respond. As demand increases, workers with progressively higher thresholds are recruited. (5) This produces flexible, demand-driven task allocation without any worker needing knowledge of colony-wide state. Age polyethism in honey bees (Robinson 1992): Workers progress through a stereotyped sequence of tasks: (a) Days 1-3: Cell cleaning and capping. (b) Days 3-10: Nursing (feeding larvae with royal jelly from hypopharyngeal glands). (c) Days 10-16: Wax production, comb building. (d) Days 16-20: Receiving and processing nectar. (e) Days 20+: Guarding, then foraging. The transition is regulated by: (1) Juvenile hormone (JH) — JH titers increase with age, causing behavioral transitions. High JH promotes foraging; low JH promotes nursing. (2) Vitellogenin — a yolk protein that acts as a 'pacemaker,' with high vitellogenin delaying the onset of foraging. Vitellogenin and JH have a mutual repression system. (3) Social regulation — the colony can accelerate or delay individual transitions. Removing foragers causes young bees to develop precociously into foragers (JH levels increase). Adding foragers delays the transition. (4) Genetic variation — polyandry (the queen mates with ~15 males) creates genetic diversity among workers, with different patrilines having different response thresholds, improving colony-level task allocation efficiency.",

      "explanation": "Animal personality research (Gosling 2001, Sih et al. 2004, Reale et al. 2007) has revealed that consistent individual behavioral differences are widespread and evolutionarily significant: Definition: An animal personality is a set of correlated behavioral traits (behavioral syndrome) that are consistent within individuals across time and/or across contexts. Key axes: (1) Bold-shy continuum: willingness to take risks, approach novel objects, explore unfamiliar areas. (2) Proactive-reactive: active coping style (bold, aggressive, superficial exploration) vs. reactive (cautious, non-aggressive, thorough exploration). (3) Aggression toward conspecifics. (4) Sociability (tendency to associate with conspecifics). Evidence: (a) Great tits (Parus major): Exploration behavior in a novel room is repeatable across tests and heritable (h² ~ 0.3-0.5). Fast explorers are also more aggressive and take more risks. Personality affects territory acquisition, survival, and reproductive success — with the optimal personality depending on environmental conditions (fluctuating selection). (b) Three-spined sticklebacks: bold individuals explore more but also approach predators, creating a behavioral syndrome linking foraging success and predation risk. (c) Fishing spiders (Dolomedes triton): consistent individual differences in voracity (predatory tendency) and activity. Maintenance of variation: (1) Fluctuating selection — different personalities are favored in different years/environments. (2) Frequency-dependent selection — rare personality types may have higher fitness. (3) Life-history trade-offs — bold individuals grow faster but die younger; shy individuals grow slowly but survive longer (pace-of-life syndrome, Reale et al. 2010).

        "Animals cannot distinguish between neighbors and strangers",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The dear enemy effect (Fisher 1954, Temeles 1994) is a widespread pattern in territorial species: Pattern: Territorial individuals respond less aggressively to familiar neighbors (whose territories are already established with stable boundaries) than to unfamiliar strangers (potential usurpers). This has been documented in birds (great tits, song sparrows), mammals (wolves, primates), reptiles (lizards), fish (cichlids), and amphibians (bullfrogs). Adaptive logic: (1) Neighbors are a known quantity — their territory is established, their fighting ability is assessed, and boundary disputes are settled. Escalated aggression wastes energy without changing the status quo. (2) Strangers are an unknown threat — they may be stronger than the current holder, may not respect established boundaries, and may attempt territory usurption. Higher aggression is warranted because the potential cost of losing territory is high. (3) Reduced aggression toward neighbors frees time and energy for foraging, mating, and parental care. Recognition mechanism: Most studied species use individual recognition (voice, scent, visual cues) to distinguish neighbors from strangers. Example: song sparrows recognize individual neighbors by song characteristics and respond with low-level countersinging, but respond to stranger songs with aggressive approach and intense singing. Exceptions: The 'nasty neighbor' effect is the opposite pattern — greater aggression toward neighbors than strangers. This occurs when neighbors pose a greater competitive threat than strangers (e.g., in species where territory takeover by neighbors is common, or where neighbors steal resources across boundaries).

      "explanation": "African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) hunting ecology (Creel and Creel 1995, 2002) illustrates the tension between group-level and individual-level benefits of sociality: Hunting success vs. pack size: (a) Larger packs benefit from relay pursuit (fresh dogs replace tired ones during the chase), strategic positioning (flanking, cutting off prey), and cooperative prey handling (subduing large prey like wildebeest). (b) Success rate increases from ~50% for pairs to ~85% for packs of 10+. Per-capita intake vs. pack size: (a) Each prey item provides a fixed amount of meat. Per-capita share = (prey mass × success rate) / (pack size). (b) At small pack sizes, increasing pack size improves success rate faster than it dilutes per-capita share → per-capita intake increases. (c) Beyond the optimal size (~5-7), further increases in pack size add diminishing marginal improvements to success rate, while per-capita share continues to decline → per-capita intake decreases. (d) This creates a hump-shaped relationship between individual benefit and group size. Why are packs often larger than the optimal foraging group size? (1) Pup defense — larger packs better defend pups against hyena kleptoparasitism and predation (lions). (2) Territory defense — larger packs maintain larger territories with more prey. (3) Kin selection — pack members are related (average r ~ 0.35) and gain indirect fitness from helping relatives reproduce. (4) Incomplete dispersal — subordinates may not be able to disperse and form new packs due to ecological constraints (lack of available mates, hostile neighboring packs). This pattern is common across cooperative hunters (lions, wolves, Harris's hawks): observed group sizes are often larger than the foraging optimum, maintained by non-foraging benefits or constraints on group dissolution.",

        "Nestling begging intensity is an honest signal of nutritional need because it is costly: begging consumes energy (up to 25-30% of resting metabolic rate in some species), attracts predators to the nest, and risks injury from sibling competition — these costs create a condition-dependent signal where only genuinely hungry chicks can sustain intense begging; parents use begging as reliable information to allocate food efficiently among offspring, preferentially feeding the hungriest chick; the Godfray (1991, 1995) signaling model shows that evolutionarily stable begging intensity increases with need but never reaches the level of outright deception",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Nestling begging as an honest signal (Godfray 1991, 1995; Kilner and Johnstone 1997) is a key example of parent-offspring communication and conflict resolution: The signaling framework: (1) Offspring have more information about their nutritional state than parents. (2) Parents benefit from allocating food efficiently (feeding the hungriest chick maximizes offspring survival per unit of food). (3) Offspring benefit from receiving food, creating a temptation to exaggerate need. (4) If begging were cost-free, all chicks would beg maximally, and the signal would become uninformative (the 'crying wolf' problem). Costs of begging that maintain honesty: (a) Energetic cost: Sustained begging can increase metabolic rate by 25-30% in passerine nestlings. Experimental studies show that chicks forced to beg for extended periods lose body mass. (b) Predation risk: Begging calls attract nest predators. Louder/more frequent begging increases nest predation rates (Haskell 1994). (c) Sibling competition: Vigorous begging may provoke sibling aggression or physically displace smaller siblings. Because these costs are disproportionately borne by chicks in poor condition (for whom the marginal cost of energy expenditure is higher), the signal is condition-dependent and honest in the evolutionarily stable equilibrium. Godfray's model: Shows that when signaling costs increase with need at a decelerating rate (and decrease with condition), an evolutionarily stable signaling equilibrium exists where: (a) Begging intensity honestly reflects need. (b) Chicks beg more when hungrier but never at the deceptive maximum. (c) Parents respond to begging because it is informative. (d) Some parent-offspring conflict remains — chicks beg slightly more than parents 'want' (reflecting the relatedness asymmetry). Experimental evidence: (a) Food-deprived chicks beg more than fed chicks. (b) Parents preferentially feed the most intensely begging chick. (c) Playback experiments: increasing begging call amplitude increases parental food delivery. (d) Chicks with experimentally elevated testosterone beg more aggressively and receive more food (but at a growth cost).",

      "explanation": "Testing prospective cognition (future planning, mental time travel) in non-human animals requires ruling out simpler explanations such as current desire, associative learning, and habit formation: The Mulcahy and Call (2006) / Osvath and Osvath (2008) approach: (1) Future-oriented tool selection: Chimpanzees and orangutans were shown a task (e.g., a food tube requiring a specific tool), then removed from the testing room. In a separate room, they were presented with an array of objects including the correct tool. They were allowed to select and keep objects. After a delay (1 hour to overnight), they were returned to the testing room. Subjects significantly more often brought the correct tool than chance predicted. (2) Controls for current drive: Animals were tested when satiated (just fed), ruling out current hunger as motivation for tool selection. Selecting a tool you don't currently need but will need later demonstrates future-oriented planning. (3) Controls for associative learning: The specific tool needed was varied across trials, and novel tool-task combinations were introduced, making simple stimulus-response associations insufficient. (4) Controls for habit formation: Varying the delay, the room, and the specific tool required prevents routine formation. Additional evidence from wild observations: (a) Chimpanzees at Bossou (Matsuzawa) carry stone hammers long distances to nut-cracking sites, anticipating future need. (b) Male chimpanzees at Furuvik Zoo (Osvath 2009) collected and cached stones before the zoo opened, later throwing them at visitors — demonstrating planning for a future emotional state (aggression toward visitors) while currently calm. (c) Scrub-jays cache food in locations based on where they anticipate being hungry in the future, not where they are currently hungry (Clayton et al. 2003). The challenge: Suddendorf and Corballis (2007) argue that true episodic future thinking (mentally constructing specific future scenarios) may be uniquely human. Animal planning may use simpler mechanisms such as semantic prospection (knowledge-based future planning without episodic mental imagery).",

        "Cooperative hunting evolves when: (1) prey are large relative to predator size and cannot be captured alone (wolves hunting moose, lionesses hunting buffalo); (2) cooperative strategies increase per-capita capture efficiency significantly above solitary hunting rates; (3) mechanisms exist to reduce cheating (kin-based groups, repeated interactions, or byproduct mutualism where each participant benefits directly regardless of others' effort) — in Harris's hawks, cooperative hunting enables capture of jackrabbits that single hawks cannot subdue, and pack size correlates with prey size",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cooperative hunting (Packer and Ruttan 1988, Boesch 1994) evolves under specific ecological conditions: (1) Prey size: When prey are too large, fast, or dangerous for a single predator, cooperation can enable capture that would otherwise be impossible. Wolves hunting moose (6-10x wolf body mass): success rate increases from ~15% for lone wolves to ~55% for packs of 4+. Lions hunting Cape buffalo: single lionesses rarely succeed; coordinated group hunts with different roles (flankers, drivers, capturers) achieve much higher success. (2) Per-capita benefit: Cooperation must provide a net per-capita benefit above solitary hunting. This creates a group-size-dependent payoff: too few hunters fail; too many dilute the per-capita share (as seen in African wild dogs). (3) Cheater control: Cooperation faces the free-rider problem — individuals may not participate fully but still share in kills. Solutions: (a) Kin-based groups (wolves, wild dogs) — helping relatives provides indirect fitness. (b) Punishment of non-participants (some evidence in chimpanzees). (c) Byproduct mutualism — each participant benefits regardless of others' actions (Harris's hawks: each hawk's presence increases its own capture probability, making defection unprofitable). Examples of cooperative hunting complexity: (a) Chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys (Boesch 2002): Different individuals adopt distinct roles — drivers, blockers, chasers, and ambushers. The probability of capture increases with the number of hunters. Meat sharing after successful hunts follows social rules (successful participants get first access). (b) Bottlenose dolphins: Coordinated fish corralling using bubble nets and mud rings. (c) Humpback whales: Bubble-net feeding involves coordinated spiral swimming to concentrate krill. (d) Army ants: mass raiding is obligately cooperative — single workers cannot capture prey.",

      "options": [
        "Fisher (1930) showed that the stable sex ratio is one where parents invest equally in sons and daughters — in most cases this produces a 1:1 sex ratio at birth, because if one sex becomes rare, parents producing the rarer sex gain a fitness advantage (their offspring have more mating opportunities), creating negative frequency-dependent selection that restores equality; deviations occur with local mate competition (Hamilton 1967) where producing excess daughters is favored when related males compete for mates in structured populations",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Fisher's principle (1930) is an ESS argument for sex ratio evolution: The core logic: (1) In a sexually reproducing population, every individual has exactly one mother and one father. (2) Therefore, the total reproductive success of all males equals the total reproductive success of all females. (3) If the sex ratio is biased (say, more females), each male has higher average reproductive success than each female. (4) Parents producing sons would have higher fitness (through their successful sons). (5) Selection favors son-production until the sex ratio equalizes. (6) At 1:1, neither sex has a reproductive advantage, and the ratio is an ESS. Fisher's equal investment principle: More precisely, the ESS is equal total investment in each sex, not necessarily equal numbers. If sons cost more to raise, fewer sons should be produced (maintaining equal total investment). Local mate competition (LMC, Hamilton 1967): When mating occurs among the offspring of a small number of mothers before dispersal (e.g., fig wasps, parasitoid wasps): (a) Producing sons is wasteful because brothers compete with each other for mates (local mate competition). (b) Producing mostly daughters (and just enough sons to fertilize them) is optimal. (c) The more foundress mothers contribute to a patch, the closer the ratio approaches 1:1 (less LMC). Confirmed: fig wasp sex ratios closely match Hamilton's LMC predictions. Other deviations: (a) Trivers-Willard hypothesis (1973): In species where parental condition differentially affects son vs. daughter fitness, parents in good condition should bias toward the sex that benefits more. High-quality red deer mothers produce more sons (who benefit more from large body size). (b) Workers in social Hymenoptera: Due to haplodiploidy, workers prefer a 3:1 female:male investment ratio (related to sisters by r = 0.75 vs. brothers by r = 0.25). Queens prefer 1:1. Observed ratios are intermediate, reflecting the queen-worker conflict.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Worker policing (Ratnieks 1988, Ratnieks and Visscher 1989) is a key mechanism for maintaining reproductive division of labor: The problem: In Hymenoptera, workers can lay unfertilized (male) eggs. If workers reproduce, it reduces colony efficiency (workers spend time laying eggs instead of working) and creates conflict over male production. The relatedness logic: (1) Single-mated queen (monandry): Workers share a father. A worker's relatedness to: her own sons = 0.5, nephews (other workers' sons) = 0.375, brothers (queen's sons) = 0.25. Workers prefer their own sons > nephews > brothers. Policing of other workers' eggs is not strongly favored because nephews (0.375) > brothers (0.25). (2) Multiply-mated queen (polyandry, typical of honeybees with ~15 matings): Workers are half-sisters on average. A worker's relatedness to: her own sons = 0.5, nephews (half-sisters' sons) = 0.125, brothers (queen's sons) = 0.25. Workers prefer own sons > brothers > nephews. Policing other workers' eggs IS favored because brothers (0.25) > nephews (0.125). Evidence in honeybees: (a) Workers can detect and preferentially destroy worker-laid eggs (which lack a queen-specific pheromone marker, the 'queen signal'). (b) >95% of worker-laid eggs are consumed within hours by other workers. (c) Only ~0.01% of males in a colony are worker-produced. (d) In species with singly-mated queens (some bumblebees, stingless bees), worker reproduction is more common and policing is less effective. Additional mechanisms: (a) Aggression toward egg-laying workers. (b) Queen pheromone suppression of worker ovary development (proximate mechanism, but policing ensures compliance even when pheromone control fails). (c) In some ant species, workers also police each other's reproductive attempts through physical aggression.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tolman and Honzik's (1930) experiment is a cornerstone of cognitive approaches to learning: Experimental design: Three groups of rats ran a complex maze daily for 17 days. Group 1 (always rewarded): Food reward at the end of the maze from day 1. Error rate decreased gradually over days (standard learning curve). Group 2 (never rewarded): No food reward at any point. High error rate throughout, showing little improvement. Group 3 (delayed reward): No food for days 1-10. Food reward introduced on day 11. KEY RESULT: On day 12, Group 3's error rate dropped dramatically to the level of Group 1 — indicating they had learned the maze just as thoroughly during the unrewarded period, but had no motivation to demonstrate this knowledge. The sudden improvement cannot be explained by one day of reinforced learning — it required pre-existing knowledge of the maze layout. Implications: (1) Learning vs. performance: Animals can acquire spatial knowledge (cognitive maps) through mere exposure, without reinforcement. This learning is 'latent' (hidden) until a motivational state activates its expression. (2) Challenges to strict behaviorism: Strict behaviorist theory (stimulus-response, S-R) predicted that learning requires reinforcement. Latent learning shows that exploration alone creates an internal representation (cognitive map) of the environment. (3) Connection to hippocampal function: Latent learning relies on the hippocampus — hippocampal lesions prevent spatial learning even in the absence of reinforcement, consistent with the hippocampus encoding spatial relationships (O'Keefe and Nadel 1978). (4) Ecological relevance: Animals routinely explore their environment and learn resource locations, escape routes, and spatial relationships before needing them — this latent spatial knowledge is critical for survival.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Smith and Fretwell's (1974) model is a foundational result in life history theory applied to behavioral decisions: Model assumptions: (1) A mother has a fixed amount of energy (R) for reproduction in a given breeding attempt. (2) Each offspring receives investment m (egg/seed size, yolk content, etc.). (3) Offspring fitness (survival probability) is a function f(m) of the investment received. (4) f(m) = 0 below some minimum viable size m₀ (too small to survive). (5) f(m) increases with m but with diminishing returns (concave function). The optimization: Number of offspring = R/m. Maternal fitness = (R/m) × f(m). The optimal m* maximizes this product. Graphically, m* is found by the tangent line from the origin to the f(m) curve. Key predictions: (1) All offspring within a brood should be the same size (m*). Producing some large and some small offspring is suboptimal. (2) m* does not depend on the mother's total resource budget R — a richer mother should produce MORE offspring of the same size, not larger offspring. (3) Environmental factors that change the shape of f(m) can shift m*: (a) Harsh environments (high juvenile mortality) → larger optimal offspring size (need more reserves to survive). (b) Benign environments → smaller optimal offspring size (even small offspring survive). Empirical support: (a) Within-species, egg size variation is often smaller than clutch size variation — consistent with a fixed optimal egg size and variable total resources. (b) Across species: fish and amphibians in ephemeral habitats produce more, smaller eggs (bet-hedging); species in stable environments produce fewer, larger eggs. Deviations: (a) Diversified bet-hedging — in unpredictable environments, producing variable-sized offspring can spread risk.

      "explanation": "Paul Sherman's (1977, 1981) study of Belding's ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi) is a classic demonstration of kin selection in nature: Key observations: (1) Alarm calling is costly: callers suffer higher predation rates than non-callers (callers attracted predator attention in 10% of cases vs. 2% for non-callers). (2) Sex difference: Adult females call significantly more often than males. (3) Dispersal pattern: Females are philopatric (remain in or near their natal area), surrounded by mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. Males disperse 100+ meters from their birthplace after their first year, living among unrelated individuals. (4) Relatedness correlation: Among females, those with more living close relatives nearby call more frequently. Females with no living relatives call at rates similar to males. Kin selection analysis: (1) For female callers: Indirect benefit = r × B, where r = relatedness to beneficiaries (0.5 for daughters, 0.5 for mother, 0.25 for nieces), B = survival benefit from early warning. Direct cost = C = increased predation risk. Hamilton's rule: alarm calling is favored when rB > C. (2) The data support this: (a) Calling frequency increases with number of nearby kin. (b) Females call more than males (more nearby kin due to philopatry). (c) Non-dispersed yearling males (still near kin) call more than adult males (who have dispersed). (d) Calling is highest when offspring are present but have not yet dispersed. Alternative explanations rejected: (a) Parental investment — calling also occurs for non-offspring kin (sisters, nieces). (b) Reciprocal altruism — no evidence that callers receive reciprocal warnings. (c) Group selection — males should also call if group benefit were the explanation.

      "explanation": "Displacement activities (Tinbergen 1951, Maestripieri et al. 1992) are a fascinating category of behavior observed across many vertebrate species: Examples: (1) Birds preening, feeding, or sleeping movements during territorial disputes. (2) Primates scratching during tense social encounters. (3) Sticklebacks digging nest-building movements during the boundary of a territorial conflict. (4) Humans touching their face, adjusting clothing, or fidgeting during stressful interviews. Proximate explanations: (1) Motivational conflict hypothesis (Tinbergen): When two strong but incompatible drives (e.g., aggression and fear) are simultaneously activated, the animal cannot perform either fully. The 'overflow' of motivation activates a seemingly unrelated behavior. (2) Disinhibition hypothesis (van Iersel and Bol 1958, Rowell 1961): Under normal conditions, the currently dominant drive inhibits other behaviors. When two drives mutually inhibit each other, neither can suppress a third behavior, which is 'disinhibited' (released from inhibition). This explains why displacement activities often involve high-priority maintenance behaviors (preening, grooming) that have low activation thresholds. (3) Arousal/stress hypothesis: Displacement activities correlate with elevated stress hormones (cortisol) and autonomic arousal. They may represent a non-specific response to high arousal that 'leaks' into available motor patterns. Ultimate explanations: (1) Signal function — displacement behaviors may have been ritualized through evolution into honest signals of motivational state. A bird preening during a conflict signals that it is conflicted (uncertain whether to attack or flee), providing information to the opponent that may influence the contest outcome. (2) Self-calming function — grooming and preening may reduce arousal (anxiolytic effect), helping the animal cope with stress and make better decisions. Evidence: scratching rates in primates correlate with anxiety measures and uncertainty in decision-making tasks.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Rescorla-Wagner model (1972) revolutionized the understanding of associative learning by formalizing the role of prediction error: The equation: ΔV_A = α_A × β × (λ - V_total). Where: ΔV_A = change in associative strength of stimulus A on this trial. α_A = learning rate parameter for stimulus A (salience, attention). β = learning rate parameter for the US (intensity). λ = maximum conditioning the US can support (asymptote). V_total = sum of associative strengths of ALL stimuli present on this trial. The key insight: Learning is driven by SURPRISE (prediction error). The term (λ - V_total) represents the discrepancy between what actually happens (US occurs, λ > 0; US doesn't occur, λ = 0) and what is expected (V_total). When V_total approaches λ (the animal fully predicts the US), no further learning occurs (ΔV → 0). Predictions: (1) Acquisition: Associative strength increases gradually with repeated CS-US pairings, following a negatively accelerated curve (diminishing returns). (2) Extinction: When the US is omitted (λ = 0), V_total > λ, so ΔV is negative — associative strength decreases. (3) Blocking (Kamin 1969): If stimulus A is fully conditioned (V_A ≈ λ), adding stimulus B in compound (A+B paired with US) produces no learning about B because V_total ≈ λ and the prediction error ≈ 0. The already-predicted US is not surprising, so B acquires no associative strength. This was the model's most striking success. (4) Overshadowing: When two novel stimuli are presented in compound, the more salient one (higher α) captures more associative strength. (5) Conditioned inhibition: If A+ (reinforced) and AB- (non-reinforced), B acquires negative associative strength (becomes a conditioned inhibitor). Limitations: The model does not account for (a) latent inhibition (pre-exposure to the CS alone retards subsequent conditioning), (b) the relative validity effect, (c) retrospective revaluation, or (d) the fact that some associations are learned more easily than others (biological constraints on learning/preparedness).",

(2) Facultative siblicide: Occurs when resources are scarce. The older sibling kills only when food is insufficient for both to survive. Examples: blue-footed boobies, many eagle and heron species. Adaptive logic: (1) Insurance hypothesis (Dorward 1962): In species with long incubation periods and unreliable hatching success, producing two eggs insures against first-egg failure. If the first egg hatches successfully, the second chick is surplus and is eliminated by siblicide, avoiding the cost of raising a second offspring under resource limitation. (2) Resource tracking (brood reduction): Parents cannot predict future food availability at the time of egg-laying. By producing more offspring than can be raised in average conditions, and allowing sibling competition to adjust brood size to actual conditions, parents optimize reproductive output. In good years, all chicks survive; in bad years, the weakest are eliminated. (3) Inclusive fitness: From the killer's perspective, eliminating a full sibling (r = 0.5) is costly in inclusive fitness terms. But if the resources saved allow the surviving sibling to have much higher fitness (growth, survival, future reproduction), the net fitness benefit can be positive. Parental complicity: Parents often facilitate siblicide by: (a) Asynchronous hatching — starting incubation before the last egg is laid creates a size asymmetry between first and last hatched (older sibling is larger and developmentally advanced). (b) Not intervening when sibling aggression occurs. (c) Allowing the dominant chick to monopolize feeding. This suggests parents benefit from the brood reduction outcome — they could prevent siblicide by synchronizing hatching or separating chicks but do not.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Organizational effects (I-Q): Phoenix et al. (1959) established that hormones have permanent organizing effects during critical developmental periods. In mammals, prenatal testosterone exposure masculinizes the brain: (a) Sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) is 3-5x larger in males. (b) Neural circuits for male-typical sexual behavior are established. (c) These effects are irreversible — adult hormone manipulation cannot produce male-typical brain structure in an animal not exposed to prenatal testosterone. (d) In birds, estrogen (aromatized from testosterone) is the primary organizing hormone for brain sexual differentiation. Activational effects (II-S): Adult hormones reversibly modulate the expression of previously organized neural circuits. Castrated adult male rats lose sexual behavior; testosterone replacement restores it. Seasonal changes in songbird singing are driven by activational effects of testosterone on HVC and RA nuclei (which were organized during development). Activational effects require intact organizational substrate — testosterone administration to an adult female rat produces no male-typical mounting if the brain was not organizationally masculinized. Challenge hypothesis (III-P): Wingfield et al. (1990) proposed that in seasonally breeding male birds, testosterone is elevated to breeding baseline during the reproductive season but spikes further only during social challenges. This explains: (a) Species differences — polygynous species with frequent male-male competition have higher peak testosterone. (b) Why testosterone is not always maximal — chronic high testosterone suppresses paternal behavior (T-treated males reduce nestling feeding), immune function, and increases metabolic rate. (c) The baseline-to-peak pattern tracks social instability, not simply reproductive activity. Immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (IV-R): Folstad and Karter (1992) proposed that testosterone simultaneously promotes secondary sexual characters (ornaments, weapons) AND suppresses immune function (reduced lymphocyte proliferation, lower antibody production). This creates an honest signaling system: only males with superior immune genes or condition can maintain high testosterone (and thus elaborate ornaments) without succumbing to parasites. Evidence: male red grouse with testosterone implants develop more prominent combs but also higher parasite loads unless they have good immune genotypes.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Garcia and Koelling's (1966) 'bright noisy water' experiment is a landmark demonstration of biological constraints on learning: Experimental design: Rats drank flavored water (saccharin taste) that also produced a flash of light and a click when licked ('bright noisy water'). Two groups: (1) Taste + Audiovisual → Nausea (LiCl injection, delayed by hours). (2) Taste + Audiovisual → Shock (immediate, to feet). Results: (1) Rats that experienced nausea developed aversion to the TASTE but NOT the audiovisual cues. (2) Rats that experienced shock avoided the AUDIOVISUAL cues but NOT the taste. This selective association violates the equipotentiality assumption of general learning theory (that any CS can be associated with any US equally). Key features of taste-aversion learning: (a) One-trial learning — a single pairing of taste and illness can produce a strong, lasting aversion. (b) Long CS-US delay — associations form even when nausea occurs hours after taste exposure (violating temporal contiguity rules of standard Pavlovian conditioning). (c) Biological relevance — in nature, toxic foods are identified by taste/smell (not by sound or light), and illness onset is delayed (digestion and absorption take time). Natural selection has shaped the learning mechanism to match the ecologically relevant CS-US contingency. Seligman's preparedness theory (1970): Associations exist on a continuum: (a) Prepared — easily formed, fast acquisition, resistant to extinction (taste-nausea, snake-fear in primates). (b) Unprepared — require standard conditioning procedures (arbitrary CS-US, e.g., tone-food). (c) Contraprepared — extremely difficult or impossible to form (taste-shock). Implications for human phobias: Ohman and Mineka (2001) showed that humans acquire conditioned fear responses to evolutionarily relevant stimuli (snakes, spiders) faster than to modern dangers (guns, electrical outlets), consistent with prepared fear learning.",

        "The landscape of fear (Laundre et al. 2001) maps spatially variable predation risk across a habitat — prey perceive different microhabitats as more or less dangerous based on predator presence, cover, escape routes, and past attack locations; prey sacrifice access to high-quality food in risky areas and aggregate in safer but lower-quality areas, creating a 'fear ecology' where non-consumptive effects of predators (behavioral changes) can have greater ecosystem impacts than direct killing — demonstrated by elk in Yellowstone avoiding open riparian areas after wolf reintroduction, allowing vegetation recovery (trophic cascade mediated by behavioral change)",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The landscape of fear (Laundre et al. 2001, 2010) integrates behavioral ecology with landscape ecology: Core concept: Just as topographic maps show elevation, the landscape of fear maps predation risk across space. Prey animals perceive and respond to this risk landscape, adjusting their behavior (habitat use, vigilance, foraging activity, group size) based on local predation risk. Components: (1) Direct cues — predator presence, scent marks, visual detection. (2) Indirect cues — habitat structure (cover, escape terrain), distance to refuge, historical attack sites. (3) Social information — alarm calls, vigilance behavior of group mates. Behavioral responses: (a) Risk-sensitive habitat selection — prey avoid high-risk areas even when food quality is high. Elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone avoid open riparian and valley bottom habitats after wolf reintroduction, despite these areas having the best forage. (b) Increased vigilance — more time scanning for predators in risky areas, less time foraging. (c) Temporal shifts — prey may shift activity to times when predators are less active (temporal partitioning). (d) Group size adjustment — larger groups in risky areas (dilution and many-eyes effects). Ecosystem consequences (non-consumptive effects of predators): (1) Yellowstone trophic cascade: After wolf reintroduction (1995-96), elk behaviorally avoided browsing in riparian zones and open areas. This allowed willow, aspen, and cottonwood regeneration, stabilizing riverbanks and increasing biodiversity. The 'ecology of fear' thus mediates a behaviorally-driven trophic cascade — predators affecting vegetation through prey behavior, not just prey numbers. (2) Giving-up density (GUD): Brown (1988) measured how much food remains in an artificial patch when a forager gives up and leaves. Higher GUD indicates higher perceived risk (the forager leaves more food behind because the marginal cost of predation risk exceeds the marginal benefit of additional food). GUDs are higher in open habitats, near predator activity, and on moonlit nights.",

        "The foraging (for) gene in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and exists as two natural alleles: for-R (rover, higher PKG activity) produces larvae that forage over long distances, and for-s (sitter, lower PKG activity) produces larvae that forage locally — this demonstrates that a single gene with natural polymorphisms can produce discrete behavioral phenotypes; the two alleles are maintained in wild populations by density-dependent selection, with rovers favored at high larval density and sitters favored at low density",

      "explanation": "The foraging (for) gene (de Belle and Sokolowski 1987, Osborne et al. 1997) is one of the best-characterized single-gene effects on behavior: The gene: for encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG, also called dg2 or PKG). Two naturally occurring alleles: for-R (Rover) — associated with higher PKG enzymatic activity. for-s (sitter) — associated with lower PKG activity. The behavioral phenotype: (1) Rover larvae (for-R): Travel longer distances while foraging on a food substrate, covering more area. Pupate farther from the food source. (2) Sitter larvae (for-s): Remain in a smaller area, feeding locally. Pupate closer to the food source. (3) The behavioral difference is robustly measurable in laboratory path-length assays. Genetic evidence: (1) The behavioral difference maps to the for locus on chromosome 2. (2) Transgenic rescue: inserting for-R into sitter background converts sitters to rover-like behavior. (3) PKG inhibitors convert rovers to sitter-like behavior. Maintenance of polymorphism: (1) At high larval density (food competition intense), rovers have higher fitness — their longer foraging paths enable them to find unexploited food patches. (2) At low density (food abundant), sitters have higher fitness — they avoid the energetic cost of unnecessary travel. (3) Density-dependent selection maintains both alleles in wild populations (~70% rover, ~30% sitter). Broader significance: (1) PKG homologs affect foraging behavior in other species: C. elegans (npr-1), honeybees (Amfor — foragers have higher PKG than nurses), ants. (2) Demonstrates that natural behavioral variation can be traced to identifiable genes and molecular pathways. (3) Illustrates gene-environment interaction — the same genotype produces the same behavior regardless of rearing conditions, but the fitness of each genotype depends on environmental conditions (density).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Mobbing (Curio et al. 1978, Caro 2005) is widespread across birds and mammals (meerkats, ground squirrels, colobus monkeys): Functions (not mutually exclusive): (1) Move-on hypothesis: Persistent mobbing causes the predator to relocate, reducing immediate and future predation risk for the mobber and its associates. Owls that are mobbed move to new roosts more frequently. (2) Perception advertisement: By approaching the predator, the mobber signals 'I see you,' eliminating the element of surprise that ambush predators depend on. The predator, knowing it has been detected, is less likely to attack. This benefits the signaler directly (selfish benefit, not altruistic). (3) Cultural transmission of predator recognition (Curio et al. 1978): Naive blackbirds learn to mob novel objects by observing experienced birds mobbing them. In Curio's experiment, birds were trained to mob a completely harmless object (a plastic bottle) by observing a tutor mobbing it, and this learned response was transmitted through chains of tutors ('cultural evolution of enemy recognition'). (4) Offspring protection: Mobbing intensity peaks during the nesting/rearing period when offspring are most vulnerable. (5) Self-advertisement of quality: Vigorous mobbing may signal individual quality to potential mates or allies. Costs: (a) Risk of injury or capture — mobbing birds are occasionally caught by the predator being mobbed. (b) Energy expenditure. (c) Drawing attention to nest location (particularly relevant for cryptic nesters). Decision rules: Animals assess the costs and benefits of mobbing. Mobbing is more likely when: (a) The predator is more dangerous (owls mobbed more than hawks in many species). (b) Offspring are present and vulnerable. (c) More mobbers are present (safety in numbers). (d) The mobber has a safe escape route.",

      "explanation": "The relationship between JH and behavioral maturation in honey bees has been extensively studied (Robinson 1992, Sullivan et al. 2000): The normal pattern: In a typical colony, JH titers increase with worker age: low JH in young nurse bees → intermediate in middle-aged bees (wax production, food processing) → high JH in foragers (~3 weeks old). But is this age-dependent or JH-dependent? Experimental approaches: (1) Single-cohort colonies (social manipulation): Create colonies with only newly emerged bees (all the same age). If behavioral maturation were purely age-based, all bees should transition simultaneously. Instead, some bees precociously develop into foragers within days, while others remain nurses — demonstrating that the colony adjusts its division of labor to meet needs, not following a rigid age schedule. (2) Forager removal experiments: Remove all foragers from a colony. Within days, some young bees (normally nurses) precociously increase JH levels and begin foraging. This demonstrates that social signals (absence of foragers, reduced ethyl oleate pheromone from forager-bee contact) accelerate behavioral development. (3) JH application (methoprene/JH analog): Topical application of JH analog to young nurse bees causes precocious foraging within 1-3 days (vs. normal onset at ~21 days). Vehicle-treated controls maintain normal nurse behavior. This demonstrates JH is sufficient to drive the behavioral transition. (4) Allatectomy (JH gland removal): Removing the corpora allata (JH-producing gland) delays or prevents the transition to foraging. JH replacement rescues the foraging phenotype. (5) Molecular markers: Precocious foragers show upregulated Amfor (PKG) gene expression in the brain, similar to normal-aged foragers, confirming that the molecular pathway matches the behavioral change regardless of actual age. Conclusion: Behavioral maturation in honey bees is regulated by JH levels, which are in turn modulated by social context (colony demography, pheromone signals) — age provides a default developmental trajectory, but social factors can accelerate or delay the transition.",

      "explanation": "Multimodal communication (Partan and Marler 1999, Hebets and Papaj 2005) is widespread across animal taxa: Examples: (1) Wolf spider (Schizocosa ocreata) courtship: Males combine visual signals (leg-waving, body vibrations) with substrate-borne seismic signals (vibrations transmitted through leaf litter). On substrates that transmit vibrations well, the seismic component is sufficient for female attraction; on poor substrates, the visual component compensates. (2) Túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus): Males produce acoustic calls (whine + chuck) combined with vocal sac inflation (visual). Females respond more to multimodal signal than to either component alone (but the visual signal also attracts predatory bats — multimodal signals increase predation risk). (3) Honeybee waggle dance: Combines mechanical vibrations (substrate-borne), acoustic signals (wing buzzing), chemical signals (floral odors on body), and spatial information (dance angle/duration). Hypotheses for multimodal signal evolution: (1) Backup (redundancy) hypothesis: Different signal components convey the same information, providing reliability in variable environments where some channels may be degraded (dense vegetation blocks visual signals; wind interferes with chemical signals). (2) Multiple messages hypothesis (Johnstone 1996): Different components convey different, independent pieces of information. Male songbirds: song complexity may indicate learning ability (neural quality) while plumage brightness indicates current condition (parasite resistance). Receivers integrate information across channels to make better decisions. (3) Receiver psychology hypothesis: Multimodal signals exploit properties of the receiver's nervous system — cross-modal integration, enhanced detection through multisensory neurons, improved memory formation for multimodal stimuli (documented in neuroscience: superior colliculus neurons respond supraadditively to coincident visual-auditory stimuli).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Zugunruhe (German: 'migration restlessness,' Gwinner 1977, 1996) is a powerful tool for studying the endogenous control of avian migration: Characteristics: (1) Nocturnal activity — nocturnal migrants (most songbirds) show increased nighttime activity during spring and autumn migration seasons. (2) Orientation — in Emlen funnels, Zugunruhe is directionally oriented in the species-typical migration direction (south in autumn, north in spring). (3) Seasonal timing — onset and cessation match normal migration periods. Evidence for endogenous control: (1) Circannual rhythms: Garden warblers (Sylvia borin) and blackcaps (S. atricapilla) raised in constant photoperiod (12:12) and temperature still show Zugunruhe at the appropriate seasons. This demonstrates an endogenous circannual clock that generates approximately yearly rhythms in migratory behavior, body condition (pre-migratory fattening), and physiology. (2) Duration corresponds to migration distance: The total amount of Zugunruhe (cumulative activity over the season) correlates with the species' normal migration distance. Garden warblers (which migrate from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa, ~5,000 km) show more Zugunruhe than blackcaps (which migrate shorter distances to the Mediterranean). This suggests the endogenous program includes a 'migration distance' component — possibly a time-based estimate of how long to fly. (3) Directional program: Hand-raised garden warblers show the correct two-step migration pattern: southwest in autumn (toward the Iberian Peninsula), then shift to southeast (toward Africa) — matching the species' dogleg migration route, despite never having migrated or seen a starry sky. (4) Genetic basis: Cross-breeding experiments between populations with different migration directions produce offspring with intermediate Zugunruhe orientations, demonstrating genetic control of migratory direction. The endogenous program is modified by experience in adults — first-year birds follow the innate program, while experienced adults also use learned landmarks and route memories.",

      "explanation": "The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis (1982) links sexual selection to host-parasite coevolution: Core idea: (1) Parasites are a major selective force in natural populations, constantly coevolving with hosts. (2) Bright, elaborate sexual ornaments are condition-dependent — their full expression requires the bearer to be in excellent health. Parasitized individuals cannot maintain full ornament development. (3) Therefore, ornaments are honest indicators of current health and, by extension, genetic resistance to prevalent parasites. (4) Females choosing the most ornamented males obtain 'good genes' for their offspring — specifically, genes for parasite resistance. This provides an ongoing selective advantage because host-parasite coevolution ensures that the 'best' resistance genotype keeps changing (Red Queen dynamics), maintaining genetic variation in both parasite virulence and host resistance. Evidence: (1) Interspecific comparison (Hamilton and Zuk 1982): Across 109 North American passerine species, species with higher prevalence of blood parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon) showed brighter, more elaborate male plumage. This positive correlation supports the idea that sexual ornaments evolved more in species where parasite-mediated selection is strongest. (2) Intraspecific evidence: (a) Male red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) — experimentally parasitized males develop shorter, duller combs and are rejected by females. (b) Male barn swallows — tail streamer length is reduced by parasitism; females prefer long-tailed males; offspring of long-tailed fathers have better immune responses. (c) Male guppies — carotenoid coloration is reduced by parasites; females prefer more colorful males. Mechanism — carotenoid trade-off: Carotenoid pigments (obtained from diet) serve dual functions: (1) Ornamental coloration (yellow/orange/red plumage, skin). (2) Immune function (antioxidants that protect immune cells, precursors for immune signaling). Because carotenoids must be allocated between these competing demands, only males in excellent condition (low parasite load, good immune function) can spare sufficient carotenoids for bright coloration.

Peach-faced lovebirds (Agapornis roseicollis) carry nesting material by tucking strips into their rump feathers, while Fischer's lovebirds (A. fischeri) carry material in their beaks. F1 hybrids attempt to tuck material into their feathers (like peach-faced) but fail ~80% of the time, eventually learning to carry material in their beaks after months of practice. What does this demonstrate about the genetic basis of behavior?",
      "options": [
        "This classic experiment (Dilger 1962) demonstrates that: (1) nest material carrying behavior has a genetic basis — the hybrid's initial attempts to tuck material show inheritance of the peach-faced motor pattern; (2) behavior is polygenic with incomplete dominance — hybrids show intermediate, conflicted motor patterns rather than pure parental types; (3) learning can modify genetically influenced behavior — hybrids eventually shift to beak-carrying through trial-and-error, but the transition takes months because they must overcome the genetically predisposed tucking tendency; (4) even 'innate' behaviors can be modified by experience, blurring the nature-nurture dichotomy",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "William Dilger's (1962) lovebird hybridization experiment is a landmark study in behavioral genetics: The parental species: (1) Peach-faced lovebird (A. roseicollis): Females cut long strips of bark or leaves and tuck them into their rump feathers (a unique motor pattern) to transport them to the nest. This behavior involves a complex, stereotyped sequence: cut strip → hold in beak → rotate head → reach back → insert strip under rump feathers → release. Multiple strips can be carried simultaneously. (2) Fischer's lovebird (A. fischeri): Females carry nesting material in their beaks (the more common avian method). No tucking behavior. The F1 hybrids: (1) Initial behavior: Hybrids consistently attempted to tuck material into their rump feathers — demonstrating genetic inheritance of the peach-faced motor pattern. However, the tucking sequence was disrupted: (a) Strips were cut too short or too long. (b) The head-rotation movement was incomplete or incorrectly directed. (c) Strips were not properly inserted and fell out (~80% failure rate). (2) This disrupted behavior suggests that the complete tucking motor pattern requires coordinated expression of multiple genes, which are 'broken up' by hybridization (like polygenic epistasis in morphological traits). (3) Gradual learning: Over months of practice, hybrids shifted toward beak-carrying. But even after years, hybrids occasionally attempted (and failed at) tucking — the genetic predisposition was never fully eliminated. Conclusions: (1) Complex motor patterns (even those appearing 'innate') have a multigenic basis. (2) Hybridization disrupts coordinated gene expression, producing intermediate or non-functional behaviors. (3) The nature-nurture dichotomy is false — behavior reflects an interaction between genetic predisposition and learning. (4) Genetic constraints on behavior can be partially overcome by experience, but the underlying predisposition persists.",

      "options": [
        "Ritualized aggression evolved because the cost of escalated fighting (injury, death, energy loss) often exceeds the value of the contested resource — ritualized displays allow opponents to assess relative fighting ability (resource holding potential, RHP) without the costs of actual combat; assessment displays are typically honest signals of RHP because they are physically constrained (roaring rate in red deer correlates with body size and lung capacity, which determine actual fighting ability); contests escalate through sequential phases of increasing cost and information, and the inferior contestant typically retreats before serious injury occurs",
        "Ritualized aggression serves no function and is simply an evolutionary vestige",

        "Ritualization has no relationship to fighting ability assessment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ritualized aggression (Maynard Smith and Price 1973, Enquist and Leimar 1983) represents an evolutionarily stable resolution to animal conflict: Why not always fight? (1) Injury costs — wounds reduce future survival and reproductive success. In red deer stags, ~6% of fights result in permanent injury, and ~0.5% result in death. (2) Energy costs — prolonged combat depletes energy reserves needed for other activities. (3) Time costs — fighting time is lost from foraging or mating. (4) Infection risk — wounds are entry points for pathogens. Ritualized assessment: (1) Red deer roaring contests (Clutton-Brock and Albon 1979): Rivals first engage in parallel walking (visual assessment of body size). Then they enter a roaring contest — each stag roars as rapidly as possible (roaring rate limited by lung capacity, which correlates with body size and fighting ability). If one stag cannot match the other's roaring rate, it withdraws. Only if roaring rates are matched does the contest escalate to antler wrestling (the most costly phase). (2) Fiddler crab claw displays: Males wave their enlarged claw (which can represent 40% of body mass). Claw size is an honest signal of fighting ability because it is physically constrained by body size. Opponents assess relative claw size visually and smaller individuals typically withdraw. However, some crabs bluff: regenerated claws are weaker than original claws of the same size, but opponents cannot distinguish them visually. (3) Sequential assessment model (Enquist and Leimar 1983): Contests proceed through escalating phases (display → threat → contact → wrestling → injury). Each phase provides increasingly accurate information about relative RHP, but at increasing cost. The weaker contestant gathers enough information to assess its inferiority and retreats before the most costly phase. Close matches escalate further and last longer (size-matched contests are more costly). Bourgeois strategy: In some species, ownership alone determines contest outcome. The 'owner always wins' convention (Maynard Smith 1982) is an ESS because it resolves conflicts without any fighting: both contestants benefit from the convention's existence.",

      "options": [
        "In the Bruce effect, a recently mated female mouse exposed to the scent (urinary pheromones) of a novel male — not the stud male that inseminated her — undergoes pregnancy block: prolactin secretion is suppressed via vomeronasal organ (VNO) detection of the stranger male's major urinary proteins (MUPs), leading to luteolysis (corpus luteum regression), progesterone withdrawal, and embryo resorption; the adaptive explanation is that the new male would likely kill any pups he did not sire (infanticide), so the female avoids wasting reproductive investment on offspring that would be killed, and instead becomes available to mate with the new (likely dominant) male",
        "The Bruce effect is caused by stress from overcrowding and has no male-specific trigger",
        "Pregnancy termination only occurs through physical aggression, never chemical signals",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Bruce effect (Bruce 1959) is a remarkable example of chemical communication influencing reproductive physiology: Discovery: Hilda Bruce (1959) found that recently inseminated female mice, when exposed to a male different from their mating partner, frequently failed to implant (pregnancy block). The mechanism: (1) Pheromone detection: The novel male's urine contains major urinary proteins (MUPs) and other volatile/non-volatile compounds that are chemically distinct from the stud male's scent. (2) Vomeronasal organ (VNO): The accessory olfactory system (VNO → accessory olfactory bulb → medial amygdala → hypothalamus) detects the foreign male pheromones. Removal of the VNO prevents the Bruce effect. (3) Neuroendocrine cascade: The foreign male signal reaches the hypothalamus, suppressing prolactin release from the anterior pituitary. Prolactin is necessary for maintaining the corpus luteum during early pregnancy in mice. (4) Luteal regression: Without prolactin support, the corpus luteum degenerates (luteolysis), progesterone levels drop, and the uterine lining cannot maintain the implanted embryos. (5) Pregnancy failure: Embryos fail to implant or are resorbed. The female returns to estrus within 4-5 days. Memory of the stud male: The female recognizes and 'remembers' the stud male's pheromone signature through a learned olfactory memory formed during mating. This memory is formed in the accessory olfactory bulb through noradrenergic mechanisms (norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus modulates synaptic plasticity). Only exposure to a DIFFERENT male's scent triggers pregnancy block. Adaptive significance: (1) Infanticide avoidance: In mice, new dominant males frequently commit infanticide. By terminating pregnancy and mating with the new male, the female: (a) Avoids wasting weeks of gestation and lactation on pups that would be killed. (b) May gain the new male's paternity protection for future litters. (2) Sexual selection: The Bruce effect may be a form of male manipulation — the new male benefits by bringing the female into estrus sooner (eliminating a competitor's offspring). (3) Female choice — alternatively, the female may benefit by 'choosing' to mate with the new, presumably superior (since he displaced the previous male) male. Taxonomic distribution: Well-documented in laboratory mice; evidence in wild mice, voles, horses, lions (where visual/auditory cues rather than pheromones may trigger similar effects), and primates (gelada baboons — females more likely to miscarry after male takeover).",

        "The information center hypothesis has been conclusively disproven in all species"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The information center hypothesis (ICH, Ward and Zahavi 1973) proposes a major adaptive function for communal roosting and colonial breeding: The hypothesis: (1) Colony/roost members vary in foraging success on any given day. (2) Unsuccessful foragers can identify successful ones (by crop fullness, behavior, etc.). (3) The next morning, unsuccessful individuals follow successful foragers to productive feeding sites. (4) The colony thus functions as an information exchange ('information center'), reducing individual foraging uncertainty. Evidence: (1) Cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) — Brown (1986): Colony members that were experimentally food-deprived were more likely to follow departing flock-mates the next morning, compared to well-fed controls. (2) Ravens (Corvus corax) — Heinrich (1988): Juvenile ravens that discovered large carcasses recruited other ravens from communal roosts (possibly to overwhelm territorial adults defending the carcass). (3) Vultures — Buckley (1996): Communal roosts facilitate information transfer about carcass locations; unsuccessful vultures follow successful ones at departure. Controversy and alternatives: (1) Passive information: Followers may simply be attracted to departures without active information transfer — local enhancement rather than intentional signaling. (2) Recruitment signal: Ward and Zahavi's original version suggested donors actively signal food location (costly signaling), but this is hard to distinguish from passive following. (3) Commodities trade: Successful foragers may 'pay' for roost site benefits (safety, thermoregulation) by tolerating followers, rather than actively advertising food locations. (4) Cultural transmission: Over time, roost-based information sharing could generate traditional foraging routes that persist across generations. Alternative hypotheses for colonial roosting: (a) Predator dilution and detection (many-eyes). (b) Thermal benefits (huddling). (c) Reduction of individual search costs. (d) Proximity to ephemeral food sources (colonies near food). The ICH makes the specific prediction that colony size should increase when food is unpredictable (more benefit from information exchange) — this has been supported in some species but not others.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phylogenetic comparative methods (Harvey and Pagel 1991, Felsenstein 1985) are essential tools in modern behavioral ecology: Ancestral state reconstruction: (1) The approach: Map the character states (behavioral phenotypes) of extant species onto a molecular phylogeny. Use statistical methods to estimate the most likely character states at ancestral nodes (internal branch points). (2) Example — mating system evolution: By mapping monogamy, polygyny, and promiscuity onto primate phylogenies, researchers inferred that the ancestral primate mating system was likely promiscuous/polygynous, and that monogamy evolved independently multiple times (in gibbons, titi monkeys, marmosets). (3) Example — eusociality: Mapping eusociality onto the insect phylogeny reveals multiple independent origins in Hymenoptera (ants evolved eusociality once; bees and wasps evolved it multiple times). Methods: (a) Maximum parsimony — minimizes the total number of character state changes on the tree. Simple but can be misled by unequal branch lengths. (b) Maximum likelihood — evaluates the probability of the observed character distribution given a model of character evolution (e.g., Mk model for discrete characters). Accounts for branch lengths. (c) Bayesian — estimates posterior probabilities of ancestral states using MCMC sampling. Incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty. Correlated evolution: The method of independent contrasts (Felsenstein 1985) or phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) tests whether two traits have evolved in a correlated fashion across species. Example: Barton and Harvey (1985) showed that neocortex size and social group size are positively correlated across primates (social brain hypothesis), controlling for shared ancestry. Pagel's (1994) test for correlated evolution of discrete traits can determine whether transitions in one binary trait (e.g., monogamy → polygyny) are contingent on the state of another (e.g., biparental care → no paternal care). Limitations: (1) Behavior rarely fossilizes, so extant-only data are used. (2) Ancestral state estimates become increasingly uncertain deeper in the tree. (3) Convergent evolution can obscure phylogenetic signal. (4) Model assumptions (e.g., equal rates of gain and loss) may not be met.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Kin recognition (Holmes and Sherman 1983, Hepper 1991) is fundamental to kin selection and is achieved through several mechanisms: (1) Spatial proximity (indirect recognition): Rule: Treat individuals in a specific location (e.g., the nest, the natal burrow) as relatives. Mechanism: Does not require individual recognition; relies on the statistical association between spatial proximity and kinship. Effectiveness: High when relatives cluster (colonial breeders, communal nests), but can be exploited by brood parasites. Example: Many bird species feed any chick in their nest — gulls, terns, and swallows use nest location as a proxy for kinship. (2) Familiarity (direct recognition through association): Rule: Learn the characteristics of individuals encountered during early development (sensitive period). Treat familiar individuals as kin. Mechanism: Learning specific odors, vocalizations, or visual features during early social interaction. Example: Belding's ground squirrels are more tolerant of littermates (even when cross-fostered) than of unfamiliar siblings — demonstrating that early association, not genetic similarity, drives recognition. (3) Phenotype matching: Rule: Compare others' phenotype (often odor) to a template and assess similarity. Mechanism: The template can be: (a) Self-referent (self-matching): Compare others' phenotype to one's own. (b) Family-referent: Compare to familiar kin encountered during development. Example: Golden hamsters preferentially nest with unfamiliar siblings over unfamiliar non-siblings, even when raised apart from their siblings — suggesting self-referent phenotype matching. MHC-based recognition: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes produce individually distinct odor profiles (via peptide-binding to MHC molecules affecting volatile metabolites in urine). Mice prefer mates with different MHC genotypes (optimal outbreeding), and can discriminate MHC-similar from MHC-dissimilar individuals by odor. Detected via the main olfactory system and/or VNO. (4) Recognition alleles: Theoretically possible (greenbeard effect) but rarely documented. The gene must pleiotropically produce a recognizable marker and direct behavior toward bearers. Fire ant Gp-9 is a candidate. Recognition errors: (a) Accepting non-kin (Type I error) — costly if altruism is wasted. (b) Rejecting kin (Type II error) — costly if fitness-enhancing interactions are missed. Optimal recognition threshold balances these errors given the frequency of kin encounters (Reeve 1989).",

      "explanation": "Mate choice copying (Dugatkin 1992, 1996; Pruett-Jones 1992) is a form of social learning applied to reproductive decisions: Key experimental evidence: (1) Guppies (Dugatkin 1992): A focal female observed a model female placed next to one of two males (the less-preferred male based on initial assessment). After observation, the focal female's preference reversed — she now preferred the male she saw with the model female. The effect was robust even when the 'endorsed' male was objectively less colorful. (2) Sailfin mollies (Schlupp et al. 1994): Females preferred males they had seen mating (or associating with a female) over males seen alone. (3) Japanese quail (Galef and White 2000): Both females and males showed mate choice copying — preferring individuals they had seen paired with a conspecific. (4) Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster, Mery et al. 2009): Females copied the mate choice of conspecifics, preferring males of the same phenotype (dust color) as males they observed mating. Adaptive significance: (1) Reduced assessment costs: Direct mate assessment (evaluating male quality through displays, contests, territory inspection) is time-consuming and risky (predation during assessment). Copying leverages the assessment work done by others. (2) Information cascade: When individual assessment is uncertain, social information may be more reliable (many observers averaging out assessment errors). (3) Trade-off: Copying is most beneficial when individual information is poor (young, inexperienced females; difficult-to-assess male traits). When individual information is strong, copying provides less benefit. Evolutionary consequences: (1) Mate choice copying can cause rapid shifts in population-wide mate preferences (cultural evolution of mating preferences). (2) It can generate positive frequency-dependent sexual selection — rare male types are disadvantaged because they are never seen being chosen. (3) It can spread arbitrary preferences (similar to Fisher's runaway). (4) Copying can maintain costly female preferences without the need for good-genes benefits.",

        "Index signals are physically unfakeable signals where the signal value is mechanically or physiologically constrained to correlate with the quality being advertised — unlike handicap signals where honesty requires a fitness cost, index signals are honest because they CANNOT be produced at higher intensity by low-quality individuals; examples include body-size-dependent call frequency in frogs (larger larynx = lower frequency), sprint speed displays in coursing predators (gazelles' stotting height limited by leg muscle power), and mandible size in stag beetles (constrained by overall body growth)",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Index signals (Maynard Smith and Harper 2003) represent an alternative mechanism for signal honesty that does not require costly signaling: Distinction from handicap signals: (1) Handicap signals: Honesty maintained by differential costs. High-quality individuals bear the cost more easily than low-quality ones, creating a correlation between signal intensity and quality. The signal IS costly, and this cost is what maintains honesty. Example: bright carotenoid plumage (costly because carotenoids are diverted from immune function). (2) Index signals: Honesty maintained by physical constraint. The signal value is mechanically linked to the quality being assessed. No cost is required for honesty because the signal literally cannot be faked. Example: body size determines acoustic frequency (larger body = larger resonating chamber = lower frequency — a physical law). Examples of index signals: (a) Frog call frequency: In many frog species, dominant frequency of advertisement calls is inversely correlated with body size because larger frogs have larger vocal cords and buccal cavities. Females can assess male body size from call frequency alone. A small frog cannot produce a low-frequency call regardless of effort — the signal is physically constrained. (b) Stotting (pronking) in gazelles: Thomson's gazelles perform high jumps with stiff legs when a predator approaches. Jump height correlates with escape speed and stamina. A weak or injured gazelle cannot stot as high — the display is physically constrained by muscle power and body condition. Predators preferentially pursue gazelles that stot less vigorously. (c) Roaring in red deer: Roaring rate is limited by lung capacity, which correlates with body size and fighting ability. (d) Mandible size in stag beetles: Limited by overall body size (allometric growth). In practice, many signals contain both index and handicap components — the distinction is about the mechanism maintaining honesty, not the signal modality.",

Social monogamy (pair bond, shared territory, biparental care) is common in birds (~90% of species) but genetic monogamy (exclusive mating) is rare — DNA paternity studies reveal extra-pair paternity in most socially monogamous species (~11% of offspring on average in passerines). Characteristics: low sexual dimorphism (both sexes similar in size and ornamentation), biparental care, relatively equal parental investment. Examples: albatrosses (lifetime pair bonds), gibbons, California mice. Polygyny (II-R): One male mates with multiple females. Types: resource defense (male controls high-quality territory that attracts multiple females — red-winged blackbirds), female defense (male directly guards group of females — elephant seals, gorillas), lek (males aggregate at display sites — sage grouse). High variance in male reproductive success (many males unmated). Strong sexual selection produces pronounced sexual dimorphism (males larger, more ornamented). Sexual size dimorphism correlates with degree of polygyny across species. Polyandry (III-P): One female mates with multiple males. Rare (<1% of bird species). Classical polyandry: sex-role reversal — females are larger, more colorful, and compete for males, who provide most parental care. Examples: jacanas (females hold territories encompassing multiple male territories), phalaropes, spotted sandpipers. In cooperative polyandry (dunnocks, Galapagos hawks), multiple males share a female and all help raise young. Promiscuity (IV-Q): Both sexes mate with multiple partners with no lasting pair bond. No biparental care (or minimal). Both sexes subject to sexual selection, though often stronger on males. Examples: many marine invertebrates with broadcast spawning, many rodent species, chimpanzees (multi-male multi-female mating). In some lekking species, the system appears promiscuous but with strong female choice.",

        "Photuris fireflies (femmes fatales) mimic the flash patterns of Photinus females to lure Photinus males, which they then capture and eat — the predatory female exploits the male's mate-searching behavior by producing a dishonest signal; similarly, zone-tailed hawks resemble turkey vultures in flight silhouette and soaring behavior, allowing them to approach prey undetected among groups of harmless vultures (aggressive mimicry); and anglerfish use a modified dorsal spine (illicium) as a lure that mimics prey items to attract fish",
        "All animal communication is perfectly honest with no deception ever occurring",
        "Deceptive signaling only occurs between different species, never within a species",
        "Exploitative signaling always leads to the extinction of the exploited species"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Exploitative signaling and deception in animal communication (Dawkins and Krebs 1978, Searcy and Nowicki 2005) challenge the assumption that all signals are honest: Types of deceptive signaling: (1) Aggressive mimicry: Predators mimic harmless species or attractive stimuli to lure prey. (a) Photuris fireflies (Lloyd 1965): Female Photuris imitates the species-specific flash pattern of female Photinus to attract male Photinus. When the male approaches expecting to mate, the Photuris female captures and consumes him. She also acquires defensive chemicals (lucibufagins) from the male. (b) Bolas spiders: Produce chemical mimics of moth sex pheromones to attract male moths. (c) Orchid mantis: Mimics flower petals to attract pollinating insects. (d) Anglerfish: Use a bioluminescent or prey-mimicking lure (esca) on a modified dorsal spine to attract prey fish. (2) Batesian mimicry (interspecific deception): Palatable species mimic unpalatable models — deceiving predators about their profitability. (3) Intraspecific dishonesty: (a) Mantis shrimp bluffing: Recently molted mantis shrimp perform meral spreads (threat displays) despite being temporarily unable to fight. Opponents that call the bluff discover the deception and attack. (b) Satellite males: In many species, small males mimic females to sneak copulations past territorial males (side-blotched lizards, cuttlefish, bluegill sunfish). (c) False alarm calls: Fork-tailed drongos give false alarm calls to kleptoparasitize meerkats and other species — when the target drops its food and flees, the drongo steals it. Drongos switch alarm call types to prevent habituation. Why doesn't deception destabilize communication? (1) Frequency-dependent selection: Deception is profitable only when rare. If most signalers are honest, receivers benefit from responding to signals. As deception increases, selection favors receiver skepticism, reducing deception's payoff. (2) Signal costs: Costly signals (handicaps) are harder to fake. (3) Punishment: Receivers may retaliate against detected cheaters.",

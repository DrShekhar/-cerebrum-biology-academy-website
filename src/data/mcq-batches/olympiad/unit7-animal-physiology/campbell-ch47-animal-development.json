      "question": "During sea urchin embryogenesis, the process of cleavage follows a specific pattern. Which correctly describes the cleavage pattern and the significance of the fourth cleavage division?",
      "options": [
        "All cleavage divisions are equal and produce cells of identical size",
        "The fourth cleavage is unequal in the vegetal hemisphere, producing four large macromeres and four small micromeres; the micromeres are specified by the localized activation of beta-catenin and give rise to the primary mesenchyme cells that form the larval skeleton",
        "The fourth cleavage occurs only in the animal hemisphere",
        "Cleavage divisions stop after the third division and gastrulation begins"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sea urchin cleavage is a classic model for understanding deterministic development and cell fate specification: (1) Cleavage pattern: The first two divisions are meridional (vertical, through the animal-vegetal axis), the third is equatorial (horizontal), producing 8 equal blastomeres. The fourth division is critical — in the animal hemisphere, it is meridional and equal (producing 8 mesomeres), while in the vegetal hemisphere it is unequal, producing 4 large macromeres and 4 small micromeres at the vegetal pole. (2) Micromere specification: The micromeres are the first cells in the embryo to become specified. They accumulate nuclear beta-catenin (due to localized inhibition of GSK-3 at the vegetal pole), which activates transcription factors including Pmar1 and downstream targets. Micromeres are sufficient for specifying mesoderm — when transplanted to the animal pole, they can induce surrounding cells to adopt mesodermal fates. (3) Fate: Micromeres give rise to primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) that ingress into the blastocoel during gastrulation and secrete the calcium carbonate spicules forming the larval skeleton. Macromeres give rise to endoderm and secondary mesenchyme. Mesomeres form ectoderm. (4) Signaling: Micromeres also act as an organizing center by secreting Delta ligand, which activates Notch signaling in adjacent macromeres, specifying them as endoderm/secondary mesenchyme. (5) Experimental evidence: Isolated micromeres autonomously differentiate into PMCs and form spicules in culture, demonstrating cell-autonomous specification.",

      "options": [
        "The animal pole, which gives rise to all endodermal structures",
        "The dorsal lip of the blastopore (Spemann's organizer), which initiates involution and patterns the dorsal-ventral axis by secreting BMP antagonists (chordin, noggin, follistatin) that establish a BMP activity gradient",

        "The blastocoele roof, which drives gastrulation through contraction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Spemann-Mangold organizer is one of the most important discoveries in developmental biology: (1) Location: The organizer forms at the dorsal marginal zone of the blastula, at the site where the dorsal lip of the blastopore will form. It is specified during fertilization when cortical rotation translocates Dishevelled and GBP (GSK-3 Binding Protein) to the dorsal side, locally inhibiting GSK-3 and stabilizing beta-catenin. (2) Function: The organizer initiates gastrulation — cells of the dorsal lip undergo bottle cell formation and involution, drawing the mesoderm and endoderm inside. As involuted cells migrate anteriorly, they form the notochord and head mesoderm. (3) BMP antagonism: The key molecular function of the organizer is secreting BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) antagonists: chordin, noggin, and follistatin. These proteins bind BMP4/7 ligands and prevent them from activating their receptors. This creates a dorsal-to-ventral gradient of BMP activity — low BMP dorsally (neural and notochord fate) to high BMP ventrally (epidermis and ventral mesoderm). (4) Transplantation: Spemann and Mangold (1924) showed that transplanting the dorsal lip to the ventral side of a host embryo induces a secondary body axis, with the host tissue forming a secondary nervous system — demonstrating the organizer's inducing capacity. (5) Conservation: Organizer equivalents exist across vertebrates: Hensen's node (chick), the node/anterior primitive streak (mouse), and the shield (zebrafish).",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Neural crest cells (NCCs) are induced at the neural plate border by a combination of BMP, Wnt, and FGF signaling at intermediate levels. The neural plate border is specified by transcription factors (Pax3/7, Zic1, Msx1/2) before neural crest specifiers (FoxD3, Snail/Slug, Sox9/10, AP-2) are activated. NCCs are considered the 'fourth germ layer' due to their remarkable developmental potential. (II) TRUE — Before migration, NCCs undergo EMT — one of the best-characterized EMT events in embryology. This involves: (a) downregulation of cell adhesion molecules (N-cadherin, E-cadherin) mediated by transcriptional repressors Snail and Slug; (b) expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin switch to lower levels); (c) acquisition of motility through RhoGTPase-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization; (d) secretion of matrix metalloproteinases for basement membrane degradation. NCCs then migrate along stereotyped pathways guided by repulsive (ephrin, semaphorin, Slit) and attractive (SDF-1/CXCL12, VEGF) cues. (III) TRUE — NCCs generate an extraordinary diversity of cell types: peripheral nervous system (sensory neurons, autonomic neurons, enteric neurons, Schwann cells/glia), melanocytes, craniofacial skeleton (frontonasal, maxillary, mandibular bones and cartilage — uniquely, these are mesenchyme-derived bone from ectoderm, not mesoderm), smooth muscle of great vessels, adrenal chromaffin cells, and cardiac outflow tract. (IV) FALSE — Neural crest cells are found at all axial levels. Cranial NCCs populate the face and pharyngeal arches. Cardiac NCCs contribute to the aorticopulmonary septum and great vessel smooth muscle. Trunk NCCs form the dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and melanocytes. Vagal and sacral NCCs form the enteric nervous system. Neurocristopathies (NCC disorders) include Hirschsprung disease, DiGeorge syndrome, and Waardenburg syndrome.",

      "options": [
        "All cell fates in C. elegans are determined autonomously by cytoplasmic determinants",
        "P2 provides an inductive signal to EMS that specifies intestinal fate; without this signal (experiments 2, 3), EMS defaults to non-intestinal fate, demonstrating that cell-cell signaling (induction) works alongside maternal determinants in C. elegans development",

        "Cell fate is random and determined after gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "These classic experiments reveal the interplay between autonomous specification and inductive signaling in C. elegans: (1) Experiment 1 — lineage tracing: P1 and its descendants (including P2, EMS, C, D, P3, P4) produce most body tissues. This mosaic lineage map was fully described by Sulston et al. (1983), earning a Nobel Prize. The invariant cell lineage of C. elegans (959 somatic cells in adults) makes it ideal for studying cell fate determination. (2) Experiment 2 — P2 ablation: When P2 is destroyed at the 4-cell stage, EMS fails to produce intestine and instead produces extra pharyngeal cells. This demonstrates that P2 provides an essential signal for intestinal fate specification in the EMS daughter cell (E cell). (3) Experiment 3 — AB isolation: Isolated AB blastomeres produce only their normal derivatives (ectoderm, pharynx), confirming that intestinal fate requires EMS, and EMS requires signaling from P2. (4) Experiment 4 — rescue: Direct contact between P2 and isolated EMS restores intestinal fate, proving that P2 provides a contact-dependent inductive signal. (5) Molecular mechanism: The signal is Wnt pathway-mediated. P2 expresses MOM-2 (a Wnt ligand) on its surface, which activates the MOM-5 (Frizzled) receptor on EMS, leading to asymmetric Wnt signaling within EMS that specifies the posterior daughter (E cell) as intestinal precursor. This involves nuclear localization of WRM-1 (beta-catenin homolog) and POP-1/TCF regulation. (6) Broader principle: C. elegans uses both autonomous specification (cytoplasmic determinants like PIE-1, P granules) and conditional specification (Wnt, Notch, and EGF signaling between cells) — it is not purely mosaic as once believed.",

      "options": [
        "Stain embryos with anti-Bicoid antibody and observe expression pattern",

        "Sequence the Drosophila genome to find maternal-effect genes",
        "Observe normal embryos under a microscope during gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The maternal determinant model for Drosophila A-P axis formation was established through elegant mRNA injection and genetic experiments: (1) Bicoid as anterior determinant: bicoid mRNA is localized at the anterior pole of the egg by the mother (anchored by staufen protein to the anterior cytoskeleton). After fertilization, Bicoid protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient. It acts as a morphogen — a transcription factor that activates anterior target genes (hunchback) at high concentrations and is required for all head and thorax structures. bicoid-mutant embryos lack anterior structures. Critically, injecting bicoid mRNA into the posterior of bicoid-mutant embryos induces anterior structures (head, thorax) at the injection site, producing a double-anterior embryo — proving that Bicoid is sufficient for anterior specification. (2) Nanos as posterior determinant: nanos mRNA is localized at the posterior pole. Nanos protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient and functions as a translational repressor of hunchback mRNA in the posterior, allowing posterior gene expression (knirps, giant). nanos-mutant embryos lack abdominal segments. Injecting nanos mRNA into the anterior of nanos-mutant embryos suppresses anterior structures and induces posterior (abdominal) structures. (3) Combined evidence: These reciprocal injection experiments — gain-of-function at ectopic positions — provide the strongest evidence that localized maternal mRNAs are necessary and sufficient for A-P axis specification. (4) Additional determinants: torso (terminal system) specifies the most anterior and posterior termini. (5) Historical significance: These experiments by Nusslein-Volhard and others earned the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",

        "Hox genes are expressed in all segments simultaneously with no spatial restriction",

        "Hox gene expression is random and varies between individual embryos"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Spatial colinearity is one of the most remarkable features of Hox gene organization and function: (1) Colinearity principle: In both Drosophila (HOM-C complex) and vertebrates (4 Hox clusters: HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, HoxD), the physical order of Hox genes on the chromosome mirrors their expression domains along the A-P axis. Genes located at the 3' end of the cluster (e.g., Hoxa1, Hoxb1) are expressed in more anterior regions (hindbrain, cervical), while genes at the 5' end (e.g., Hoxa13, Hoxd13) are expressed in more posterior regions (lumbar, sacral, limb tips). (2) Drosophila: The HOM-C complex is split into two clusters — Antennapedia complex (ANT-C: labial, proboscipedia, Deformed, Sex combs reduced, Antennapedia) specifying head and anterior thorax, and Bithorax complex (BX-C: Ultrabithorax, abdominal-A, Abdominal-B) specifying posterior thorax and abdomen. The 3'-to-5' order matches anterior-to-posterior expression. (3) Temporal colinearity: In vertebrates, there is also temporal colinearity — 3' genes are activated earlier in development than 5' genes. This is linked to progressive chromatin opening from the 3' end, regulated by Polycomb (PcG, silencing) and Trithorax (TrxG, activation) group proteins. (4) Posterior prevalence: When expression domains overlap, the more posterior (5') Hox gene dominates and specifies segment identity — known as posterior prevalence or phenotypic suppression. (5) Gain/loss of function: Misexpression of anterior Hox genes posteriorly causes anterior transformations (homeotic transformations), while loss of function causes posterior-to-anterior transformations.",

        "The notochord produces BMP to induce epidermis formation",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The notochord is a defining feature of chordates and functions as a critical signaling center in vertebrate embryogenesis: (1) Neural tube patterning: The notochord (and subsequently the floor plate it induces) secretes Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which forms a ventral-to-dorsal gradient in the neural tube. Different concentrations of Shh specify different neural progenitor domains: (a) Highest Shh — floor plate (FP) cells; (b) High Shh — V3 interneurons; (c) Moderate Shh — motor neurons (MN); (d) Lower Shh — V2 and V1 interneurons. The dorsal neural tube is patterned by BMP and Wnt signals from the roof plate. This combinatorial signaling establishes at least 11 distinct progenitor domains along the dorso-ventral axis. (2) Somite patterning: Shh from the notochord (and floor plate) induces the ventromedial somite to become sclerotome, which gives rise to vertebrae and ribs. This involves activation of Pax1 and repression of Pax3/7. BMP from the lateral plate mesoderm and Wnt from the dorsal neural tube specify the dermomyotome (future dermis and skeletal muscle). (3) Left-right asymmetry: The notochord plays a role in establishing left-right asymmetry through Nodal signaling. (4) Structural role: The notochord provides mechanical support for the embryo and guides cell migration during gastrulation (convergent extension). (5) Fate: In most vertebrates, the notochord is largely replaced by the vertebral column but persists as the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. In some basal chordates (amphioxus), it persists throughout life.",

        "Mechanical forces from the growing neural tube physically segment the mesoderm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Somitogenesis is a paradigm example of biological oscillators coupled with morphogen gradients: (1) Segmentation clock: Genes in the Notch, Wnt, and FGF pathways oscillate in expression in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a species-specific period (90 minutes in mouse, 30 minutes in zebrafish, ~6 hours in human). The key oscillating gene in mouse is Lunatic fringe (Lfng), a glycosyltransferase that modulates Notch receptor sensitivity. Hes/Her transcription factors (Notch targets) also oscillate through a negative feedback loop — Hes7 protein represses its own transcription after a delay set by mRNA splicing and protein half-life. (2) Determination front (wavefront): Two opposing signaling gradients establish the determination front — FGF8 and Wnt3a are high posteriorly (from the tail bud, maintaining PSM in an immature state) and decrease anteriorly, while retinoic acid (RA) is high anteriorly (produced by somites already formed). The determination front is where these gradients reach threshold levels. (3) Clock-and-wavefront model: A new somite boundary forms when PSM cells at the determination front are in the 'permissive' phase of the oscillation cycle. As the axis elongates and the tail bud recedes, the determination front sweeps posteriorly, and each oscillation cycle produces one new somite pair. (4) Boundary formation: At the boundary, Notch signaling activates Mesp2 transcription factor in the anterior compartment of the forming somite. Mesp2 activates Eph receptors, while the posterior compartment expresses ephrin ligands. Eph-ephrin repulsive signaling at the boundary causes cell separation and boundary formation. (5) Clinical: Mutations in clock genes cause spondylocostal dysostosis (vertebral segmentation defects) in humans.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Drosophila dorsal-ventral axis determination is a remarkable signaling cascade that connects maternal genes to zygotic gene expression: (1) Pipe: The protease Pipe is expressed only in ventral follicle cells (egg chamber cells surrounding the oocyte). Pipe sulfates proteoglycans on the ventral eggshell (vitelline membrane). (2) Protease cascade: After fertilization, the sulfated proteoglycans activate a serine protease cascade in the perivitelline space (between the vitelline membrane and embryo surface): Easter, Snake, and Gastrulation Defective. This cascade culminates in cleavage of proSpätzle to active Spätzle specifically on the ventral side. (3) Toll receptor activation: Active Spätzle binds the transmembrane receptor Toll on the ventral embryo surface. Toll is present uniformly on the embryo surface, but only activated ventrally where Spätzle is processed. (4) Intracellular signaling: Activated Toll recruits the adaptor proteins Tube and Pelle (a kinase), leading to phosphorylation and degradation of Cactus (the IkappaB homolog). Cactus normally sequesters Dorsal (the NF-kappaB homolog) in the cytoplasm. Upon Cactus degradation, Dorsal translocates to the nucleus — with highest nuclear Dorsal ventrally, forming a gradient. (5) Target genes: High nuclear Dorsal activates ventral genes (twist, snail — mesoderm), moderate Dorsal activates lateral genes (rhomboid — neuroectoderm), and the absence of Dorsal allows dorsal genes (zerknüllt, decapentaplegic/BMP — amnioserosa and dorsal ectoderm). (6) Conservation: This pathway is homologous to the mammalian Toll-like receptor/NF-kappaB innate immune signaling pathway, revealing a deep evolutionary connection between development and immunity.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Developmental apoptosis is essential for sculpting tissue architecture and removing transient structures: (1) Interdigital cell death: In amniote (mammals, birds) limb development, the digits initially form as ridges separated by webbed interdigital mesenchyme. BMP signaling (BMP2, BMP4, BMP7) is specifically activated in the interdigital zones, where it activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Bax/Bak pore formation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation). The result is elimination of interdigital tissue, freeing individual digits. (2) Duck vs chicken: Ducks retain interdigital webbing because of higher FGF signaling (anti-apoptotic) and lower BMP activity in the interdigital zones. Experimental application of BMP to duck interdigital tissue induces apoptosis and digit separation. (3) Other developmental apoptosis examples: (a) Nervous system — approximately 50% of all neurons generated during development die by apoptosis (those that fail to receive sufficient neurotrophic support from target tissues); (b) Immune system — T cells that fail positive selection or pass negative selection in the thymus are eliminated by apoptosis; (c) Tail resorption during amphibian metamorphosis; (d) Elimination of Müllerian duct cells in males (AMH-dependent); (e) Hollow organ lumen formation (e.g., esophagus); (f) Elimination of larval structures in metamorphosing insects.

      "explanation": "The data illustrate the classic morphogen gradient model applied to neural tube patterning: (1) French flag model: Wolpert's French flag model proposes that a morphogen at different concentrations activates different genes and specifies different cell fates — like a gradient of blue dye creating red, white, and blue stripes at different thresholds. The Shh gradient in the neural tube is the best-characterized example of this model in vertebrate development. (2) Gradient formation: Shh is secreted from the notochord and floor plate, forming a ventral-to-dorsal concentration gradient. The gradient is shaped by: (a) diffusion through the extracellular space; (b) binding to the receptor Patched (which both transduces the signal and limits Shh spread); (c) cholesterol and palmitate modifications on Shh that affect its range. (3) Transcription factor code: Different Shh concentrations activate or repress distinct homeodomain and bHLH transcription factors, creating a combinatorial transcription factor code: Class I factors (Pax6, Irx3, Dbx1/2) are repressed by Shh at specific thresholds; Class II factors (Nkx2.2, Olig2, Nkx6.1) are activated by Shh. The boundaries between adjacent progenitor domains are sharpened by mutual cross-repression between Class I and Class II factors in adjacent domains. (4) Temporal dynamics: Recent work shows that Shh signaling duration (not just concentration) contributes to cell fate specification — cells integrate both concentration and exposure time (the 'temporal adaptation' model). (5) Clinical: Mutations affecting Shh signaling cause holoprosencephaly (insufficient Shh) or basal cell carcinoma (constitutive Shh pathway activation).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The three signaling centers of the developing limb bud coordinate growth along the three axes: (1) Apical ectodermal ridge (AER) — proximal-distal axis: The AER is a ridge of thickened ectoderm at the distal margin of the limb bud. It secretes FGFs (primarily FGF8, with contributions from FGF4, FGF9, FGF17) that maintain the underlying mesenchyme in a proliferative, undifferentiated state. Classical experiments by Saunders (1948) showed that AER removal at progressively later stages produces progressively more complete limbs — early removal produces only a humerus, later removal produces humerus + radius/ulna, and latest removal allows full digit formation. This led to the 'progress zone' model — cells leave the progress zone (immediately beneath the AER) as limb growth pushes the AER distally, with their positional identity determined by the time spent in the progress zone. (2) ZPA — anterior-posterior axis: The zone of polarizing activity at the posterior limb margin secretes Shh, specifying digit identity (digit 5 nearest ZPA/highest Shh, digit 2 furthest/lowest Shh). Transplanting ZPA to the anterior margin produces mirror-image digit duplications. (3) Dorsal ectoderm — dorsal-ventral axis: Wnt7a from the dorsal ectoderm induces Lmx1b in the dorsal mesenchyme, specifying dorsal (knuckle/nail) identity. En-1 in the ventral ectoderm represses Wnt7a ventrally, specifying ventral (palm/sole) identity. (4) Positive feedback: AER and ZPA maintain each other — FGFs from AER maintain Shh expression in ZPA, while Shh from ZPA maintains FGF expression in AER via Gremlin-mediated BMP inhibition. This self-sustaining loop drives continued limb outgrowth.",

      "options": [
        "A single gene simultaneously specifies all segment boundaries",
        "Maternal gradients (Bicoid, Nanos) activate gap genes in broad domains, gap genes activate pair-rule genes in alternating stripes, and pair-rule genes activate segment polarity genes in 14 narrow stripes — each level of the hierarchy reads the pattern from the level above and generates a more refined pattern with higher spatial resolution",
        "All segmentation occurs at the same time without any hierarchical cascade",
        "Segmentation is controlled entirely by physical forces rather than gene expression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Drosophila segmentation cascade is the best-understood example of progressive pattern refinement in biology: (1) Maternal coordinate genes (level 1): Bicoid (anterior morphogen) and Nanos (posterior morphogen) protein gradients provide crude positional information along the A-P axis. Bicoid is a homeodomain transcription factor that directly activates target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) Gap genes (level 2): Maternal gradients activate gap genes (hunchback, Krüppel, knirps, giant) in broad, overlapping domains. Each gap gene is expressed in 1-2 broad regions of the embryo. Gap genes encode transcription factors that both activate and repress each other, sharpening their domain boundaries. Loss of a gap gene eliminates contiguous groups of segments. (3) Pair-rule genes (level 3): Gap gene combinations activate pair-rule genes (hairy, even-skipped, fushi tarazu, runt) in seven alternating stripes. Each stripe is controlled by a separate enhancer element that reads a unique combination of gap gene inputs. For example, the eve stripe 2 enhancer is activated by Bicoid and Hunchback and repressed by Giant and Krüppel — the overlap of activator and repressor domains defines the narrow stripe. (4) Segment polarity genes (level 4): Pair-rule genes activate segment polarity genes (engrailed, wingless, hedgehog) in 14 stripes — one per segment. Engrailed (in posterior cells) and Wingless (in anterior cells of each segment) maintain segment boundaries through reciprocal signaling (Hedgehog-Wingless positive feedback loop). (5) Resolution: From ~3 broad maternal domains → ~4 gap domains → 7 pair-rule stripes → 14 segment polarity stripes. Each level approximately doubles the spatial resolution.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Transfilter experiments are a classical approach to distinguish contact-dependent from contact-independent signaling in embryonic induction: (1) Experimental logic: By placing inducing tissue on one side of a porous membrane and responding tissue on the other side, researchers can test whether signaling molecules can diffuse across the gap. The key variable is pore size: (a) Large pores (0.4-0.8 μm): Allow cell processes (filopodia, cytonemes) to extend through, enabling both diffusible and contact-dependent signaling; (b) Small pores (0.05-0.1 μm): Allow only small molecules/proteins to diffuse through, blocking cell-cell contact; (c) No filter (sandwich): Direct contact control. (2) Results for neural induction: Classic transfilter experiments by Saxen and others showed that neural induction in amphibians can occur across filters with small pores, suggesting involvement of diffusible signals. We now know these include BMP antagonists (Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin) secreted by the organizer. (3) Contact-dependent signals: Some inductive interactions require direct contact — for example, Delta-Notch signaling (lateral inhibition during neurogenesis) requires membrane-bound ligand-receptor interaction. These signals are blocked by filters of any pore size. (4) Modern interpretation: Many inductive events use a combination of diffusible and contact-dependent signals. Additionally, cytonemes (specialized filopodia) can transport signaling molecules over several cell diameters, blurring the contact vs diffusion distinction. (5) Controls: Including heat-inactivated tissue, conditioned medium alone, and inducer-alone and responder-alone conditions validates the specificity of the interaction.",

        "Cells undergo apoptosis to reshape the tissue during gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Convergent extension (CE) is one of the most important morphogenetic movements in embryogenesis: (1) Mechanism: Cells intercalate — they rearrange by moving between their neighbors. In CE, cells intercalate along the mediolateral axis (perpendicular to the A-P axis), causing the tissue to converge (narrow) along the mediolateral axis and extend (lengthen) along the A-P axis. This transforms a short, wide tissue into a long, narrow one without cell division or changes in cell number. (2) Molecular control: CE is driven by the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, also known as the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Key components include: Wnt11, Dishevelled (Dsh), Strabismus/Van Gogh (Vangl2), Prickle, Flamingo/Celsr, and downstream effectors RhoA and Rac1 (small GTPases). PCP signaling polarizes cells, generating mediolaterally oriented protrusions (lamellipodia) that drive intercalation. (3) Gastrulation: CE drives the elongation of the body axis during gastrulation. In Xenopus, CE of the involuting marginal zone (prospective notochord and somitic mesoderm) is the major force driving body axis elongation. In zebrafish, CE also drives the convergence of lateral mesoderm toward the dorsal midline. (4) Neural tube closure: CE also operates during neural tube closure, narrowing and lengthening the neural plate. Mutations in PCP pathway genes (e.g., Vangl2 in the Looptail mouse) cause failure of neural tube closure (craniorachischisis). (5) Human disease: Human mutations in PCP genes (VANGL1/2, CELSR1, SCRIB) are associated with neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly).",

      "question": "During sea urchin embryogenesis, the process of cleavage follows a specific pattern. Which correctly describes the cleavage pattern and the significance of the fourth cleavage division?",
      "options": [
        "All cleavage divisions are equal and produce cells of identical size",
        "The fourth cleavage is unequal in the vegetal hemisphere, producing four large macromeres and four small micromeres; the micromeres are specified by the localized activation of beta-catenin and give rise to the primary mesenchyme cells that form the larval skeleton",
        "The fourth cleavage occurs only in the animal hemisphere",
        "Cleavage divisions stop after the third division and gastrulation begins"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sea urchin cleavage is a classic model for understanding deterministic development and cell fate specification: (1) Cleavage pattern: The first two divisions are meridional (vertical, through the animal-vegetal axis), the third is equatorial (horizontal), producing 8 equal blastomeres. The fourth division is critical — in the animal hemisphere, it is meridional and equal (producing 8 mesomeres), while in the vegetal hemisphere it is unequal, producing 4 large macromeres and 4 small micromeres at the vegetal pole. (2) Micromere specification: The micromeres are the first cells in the embryo to become specified. They accumulate nuclear beta-catenin (due to localized inhibition of GSK-3 at the vegetal pole), which activates transcription factors including Pmar1 and downstream targets. Micromeres are sufficient for specifying mesoderm — when transplanted to the animal pole, they can induce surrounding cells to adopt mesodermal fates. (3) Fate: Micromeres give rise to primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) that ingress into the blastocoel during gastrulation and secrete the calcium carbonate spicules forming the larval skeleton. Macromeres give rise to endoderm and secondary mesenchyme. Mesomeres form ectoderm. (4) Signaling: Micromeres also act as an organizing center by secreting Delta ligand, which activates Notch signaling in adjacent macromeres, specifying them as endoderm/secondary mesenchyme. (5) Experimental evidence: Isolated micromeres autonomously differentiate into PMCs and form spicules in culture, demonstrating cell-autonomous specification.",

      "options": [
        "The animal pole, which gives rise to all endodermal structures",
        "The dorsal lip of the blastopore (Spemann's organizer), which initiates involution and patterns the dorsal-ventral axis by secreting BMP antagonists (chordin, noggin, follistatin) that establish a BMP activity gradient",

        "The blastocoele roof, which drives gastrulation through contraction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Spemann-Mangold organizer is one of the most important discoveries in developmental biology: (1) Location: The organizer forms at the dorsal marginal zone of the blastula, at the site where the dorsal lip of the blastopore will form. It is specified during fertilization when cortical rotation translocates Dishevelled and GBP (GSK-3 Binding Protein) to the dorsal side, locally inhibiting GSK-3 and stabilizing beta-catenin. (2) Function: The organizer initiates gastrulation — cells of the dorsal lip undergo bottle cell formation and involution, drawing the mesoderm and endoderm inside. As involuted cells migrate anteriorly, they form the notochord and head mesoderm. (3) BMP antagonism: The key molecular function of the organizer is secreting BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) antagonists: chordin, noggin, and follistatin. These proteins bind BMP4/7 ligands and prevent them from activating their receptors. This creates a dorsal-to-ventral gradient of BMP activity — low BMP dorsally (neural and notochord fate) to high BMP ventrally (epidermis and ventral mesoderm). (4) Transplantation: Spemann and Mangold (1924) showed that transplanting the dorsal lip to the ventral side of a host embryo induces a secondary body axis, with the host tissue forming a secondary nervous system — demonstrating the organizer's inducing capacity. (5) Conservation: Organizer equivalents exist across vertebrates: Hensen's node (chick), the node/anterior primitive streak (mouse), and the shield (zebrafish).",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Neural crest cells (NCCs) are induced at the neural plate border by a combination of BMP, Wnt, and FGF signaling at intermediate levels. The neural plate border is specified by transcription factors (Pax3/7, Zic1, Msx1/2) before neural crest specifiers (FoxD3, Snail/Slug, Sox9/10, AP-2) are activated. NCCs are considered the 'fourth germ layer' due to their remarkable developmental potential. (II) TRUE — Before migration, NCCs undergo EMT — one of the best-characterized EMT events in embryology. This involves: (a) downregulation of cell adhesion molecules (N-cadherin, E-cadherin) mediated by transcriptional repressors Snail and Slug; (b) expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin switch to lower levels); (c) acquisition of motility through RhoGTPase-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization; (d) secretion of matrix metalloproteinases for basement membrane degradation. NCCs then migrate along stereotyped pathways guided by repulsive (ephrin, semaphorin, Slit) and attractive (SDF-1/CXCL12, VEGF) cues. (III) TRUE — NCCs generate an extraordinary diversity of cell types: peripheral nervous system (sensory neurons, autonomic neurons, enteric neurons, Schwann cells/glia), melanocytes, craniofacial skeleton (frontonasal, maxillary, mandibular bones and cartilage — uniquely, these are mesenchyme-derived bone from ectoderm, not mesoderm), smooth muscle of great vessels, adrenal chromaffin cells, and cardiac outflow tract. (IV) FALSE — Neural crest cells are found at all axial levels. Cranial NCCs populate the face and pharyngeal arches. Cardiac NCCs contribute to the aorticopulmonary septum and great vessel smooth muscle. Trunk NCCs form the dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and melanocytes. Vagal and sacral NCCs form the enteric nervous system. Neurocristopathies (NCC disorders) include Hirschsprung disease, DiGeorge syndrome, and Waardenburg syndrome.",

      "options": [
        "All cell fates in C. elegans are determined autonomously by cytoplasmic determinants",
        "P2 provides an inductive signal to EMS that specifies intestinal fate; without this signal (experiments 2, 3), EMS defaults to non-intestinal fate, demonstrating that cell-cell signaling (induction) works alongside maternal determinants in C. elegans development",

        "Cell fate is random and determined after gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "These classic experiments reveal the interplay between autonomous specification and inductive signaling in C. elegans: (1) Experiment 1 — lineage tracing: P1 and its descendants (including P2, EMS, C, D, P3, P4) produce most body tissues. This mosaic lineage map was fully described by Sulston et al. (1983), earning a Nobel Prize. The invariant cell lineage of C. elegans (959 somatic cells in adults) makes it ideal for studying cell fate determination. (2) Experiment 2 — P2 ablation: When P2 is destroyed at the 4-cell stage, EMS fails to produce intestine and instead produces extra pharyngeal cells. This demonstrates that P2 provides an essential signal for intestinal fate specification in the EMS daughter cell (E cell). (3) Experiment 3 — AB isolation: Isolated AB blastomeres produce only their normal derivatives (ectoderm, pharynx), confirming that intestinal fate requires EMS, and EMS requires signaling from P2. (4) Experiment 4 — rescue: Direct contact between P2 and isolated EMS restores intestinal fate, proving that P2 provides a contact-dependent inductive signal. (5) Molecular mechanism: The signal is Wnt pathway-mediated. P2 expresses MOM-2 (a Wnt ligand) on its surface, which activates the MOM-5 (Frizzled) receptor on EMS, leading to asymmetric Wnt signaling within EMS that specifies the posterior daughter (E cell) as intestinal precursor. This involves nuclear localization of WRM-1 (beta-catenin homolog) and POP-1/TCF regulation. (6) Broader principle: C. elegans uses both autonomous specification (cytoplasmic determinants like PIE-1, P granules) and conditional specification (Wnt, Notch, and EGF signaling between cells) — it is not purely mosaic as once believed.",

      "options": [
        "Stain embryos with anti-Bicoid antibody and observe expression pattern",

        "Sequence the Drosophila genome to find maternal-effect genes",
        "Observe normal embryos under a microscope during gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The maternal determinant model for Drosophila A-P axis formation was established through elegant mRNA injection and genetic experiments: (1) Bicoid as anterior determinant: bicoid mRNA is localized at the anterior pole of the egg by the mother (anchored by staufen protein to the anterior cytoskeleton). After fertilization, Bicoid protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient. It acts as a morphogen — a transcription factor that activates anterior target genes (hunchback) at high concentrations and is required for all head and thorax structures. bicoid-mutant embryos lack anterior structures. Critically, injecting bicoid mRNA into the posterior of bicoid-mutant embryos induces anterior structures (head, thorax) at the injection site, producing a double-anterior embryo — proving that Bicoid is sufficient for anterior specification. (2) Nanos as posterior determinant: nanos mRNA is localized at the posterior pole. Nanos protein forms a posterior-to-anterior gradient and functions as a translational repressor of hunchback mRNA in the posterior, allowing posterior gene expression (knirps, giant). nanos-mutant embryos lack abdominal segments. Injecting nanos mRNA into the anterior of nanos-mutant embryos suppresses anterior structures and induces posterior (abdominal) structures. (3) Combined evidence: These reciprocal injection experiments — gain-of-function at ectopic positions — provide the strongest evidence that localized maternal mRNAs are necessary and sufficient for A-P axis specification. (4) Additional determinants: torso (terminal system) specifies the most anterior and posterior termini. (5) Historical significance: These experiments by Nusslein-Volhard and others earned the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",

        "Hox genes are expressed in all segments simultaneously with no spatial restriction",

        "Hox gene expression is random and varies between individual embryos"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Spatial colinearity is one of the most remarkable features of Hox gene organization and function: (1) Colinearity principle: In both Drosophila (HOM-C complex) and vertebrates (4 Hox clusters: HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, HoxD), the physical order of Hox genes on the chromosome mirrors their expression domains along the A-P axis. Genes located at the 3' end of the cluster (e.g., Hoxa1, Hoxb1) are expressed in more anterior regions (hindbrain, cervical), while genes at the 5' end (e.g., Hoxa13, Hoxd13) are expressed in more posterior regions (lumbar, sacral, limb tips). (2) Drosophila: The HOM-C complex is split into two clusters — Antennapedia complex (ANT-C: labial, proboscipedia, Deformed, Sex combs reduced, Antennapedia) specifying head and anterior thorax, and Bithorax complex (BX-C: Ultrabithorax, abdominal-A, Abdominal-B) specifying posterior thorax and abdomen. The 3'-to-5' order matches anterior-to-posterior expression. (3) Temporal colinearity: In vertebrates, there is also temporal colinearity — 3' genes are activated earlier in development than 5' genes. This is linked to progressive chromatin opening from the 3' end, regulated by Polycomb (PcG, silencing) and Trithorax (TrxG, activation) group proteins. (4) Posterior prevalence: When expression domains overlap, the more posterior (5') Hox gene dominates and specifies segment identity — known as posterior prevalence or phenotypic suppression. (5) Gain/loss of function: Misexpression of anterior Hox genes posteriorly causes anterior transformations (homeotic transformations), while loss of function causes posterior-to-anterior transformations.",

        "The notochord produces BMP to induce epidermis formation",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The notochord is a defining feature of chordates and functions as a critical signaling center in vertebrate embryogenesis: (1) Neural tube patterning: The notochord (and subsequently the floor plate it induces) secretes Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which forms a ventral-to-dorsal gradient in the neural tube. Different concentrations of Shh specify different neural progenitor domains: (a) Highest Shh — floor plate (FP) cells; (b) High Shh — V3 interneurons; (c) Moderate Shh — motor neurons (MN); (d) Lower Shh — V2 and V1 interneurons. The dorsal neural tube is patterned by BMP and Wnt signals from the roof plate. This combinatorial signaling establishes at least 11 distinct progenitor domains along the dorso-ventral axis. (2) Somite patterning: Shh from the notochord (and floor plate) induces the ventromedial somite to become sclerotome, which gives rise to vertebrae and ribs. This involves activation of Pax1 and repression of Pax3/7. BMP from the lateral plate mesoderm and Wnt from the dorsal neural tube specify the dermomyotome (future dermis and skeletal muscle). (3) Left-right asymmetry: The notochord plays a role in establishing left-right asymmetry through Nodal signaling. (4) Structural role: The notochord provides mechanical support for the embryo and guides cell migration during gastrulation (convergent extension). (5) Fate: In most vertebrates, the notochord is largely replaced by the vertebral column but persists as the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. In some basal chordates (amphioxus), it persists throughout life.",

        "Mechanical forces from the growing neural tube physically segment the mesoderm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Somitogenesis is a paradigm example of biological oscillators coupled with morphogen gradients: (1) Segmentation clock: Genes in the Notch, Wnt, and FGF pathways oscillate in expression in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a species-specific period (90 minutes in mouse, 30 minutes in zebrafish, ~6 hours in human). The key oscillating gene in mouse is Lunatic fringe (Lfng), a glycosyltransferase that modulates Notch receptor sensitivity. Hes/Her transcription factors (Notch targets) also oscillate through a negative feedback loop — Hes7 protein represses its own transcription after a delay set by mRNA splicing and protein half-life. (2) Determination front (wavefront): Two opposing signaling gradients establish the determination front — FGF8 and Wnt3a are high posteriorly (from the tail bud, maintaining PSM in an immature state) and decrease anteriorly, while retinoic acid (RA) is high anteriorly (produced by somites already formed). The determination front is where these gradients reach threshold levels. (3) Clock-and-wavefront model: A new somite boundary forms when PSM cells at the determination front are in the 'permissive' phase of the oscillation cycle. As the axis elongates and the tail bud recedes, the determination front sweeps posteriorly, and each oscillation cycle produces one new somite pair. (4) Boundary formation: At the boundary, Notch signaling activates Mesp2 transcription factor in the anterior compartment of the forming somite. Mesp2 activates Eph receptors, while the posterior compartment expresses ephrin ligands. Eph-ephrin repulsive signaling at the boundary causes cell separation and boundary formation. (5) Clinical: Mutations in clock genes cause spondylocostal dysostosis (vertebral segmentation defects) in humans.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Drosophila dorsal-ventral axis determination is a remarkable signaling cascade that connects maternal genes to zygotic gene expression: (1) Pipe: The protease Pipe is expressed only in ventral follicle cells (egg chamber cells surrounding the oocyte). Pipe sulfates proteoglycans on the ventral eggshell (vitelline membrane). (2) Protease cascade: After fertilization, the sulfated proteoglycans activate a serine protease cascade in the perivitelline space (between the vitelline membrane and embryo surface): Easter, Snake, and Gastrulation Defective. This cascade culminates in cleavage of proSpätzle to active Spätzle specifically on the ventral side. (3) Toll receptor activation: Active Spätzle binds the transmembrane receptor Toll on the ventral embryo surface. Toll is present uniformly on the embryo surface, but only activated ventrally where Spätzle is processed. (4) Intracellular signaling: Activated Toll recruits the adaptor proteins Tube and Pelle (a kinase), leading to phosphorylation and degradation of Cactus (the IkappaB homolog). Cactus normally sequesters Dorsal (the NF-kappaB homolog) in the cytoplasm. Upon Cactus degradation, Dorsal translocates to the nucleus — with highest nuclear Dorsal ventrally, forming a gradient. (5) Target genes: High nuclear Dorsal activates ventral genes (twist, snail — mesoderm), moderate Dorsal activates lateral genes (rhomboid — neuroectoderm), and the absence of Dorsal allows dorsal genes (zerknüllt, decapentaplegic/BMP — amnioserosa and dorsal ectoderm). (6) Conservation: This pathway is homologous to the mammalian Toll-like receptor/NF-kappaB innate immune signaling pathway, revealing a deep evolutionary connection between development and immunity.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Developmental apoptosis is essential for sculpting tissue architecture and removing transient structures: (1) Interdigital cell death: In amniote (mammals, birds) limb development, the digits initially form as ridges separated by webbed interdigital mesenchyme. BMP signaling (BMP2, BMP4, BMP7) is specifically activated in the interdigital zones, where it activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Bax/Bak pore formation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation). The result is elimination of interdigital tissue, freeing individual digits. (2) Duck vs chicken: Ducks retain interdigital webbing because of higher FGF signaling (anti-apoptotic) and lower BMP activity in the interdigital zones. Experimental application of BMP to duck interdigital tissue induces apoptosis and digit separation. (3) Other developmental apoptosis examples: (a) Nervous system — approximately 50% of all neurons generated during development die by apoptosis (those that fail to receive sufficient neurotrophic support from target tissues); (b) Immune system — T cells that fail positive selection or pass negative selection in the thymus are eliminated by apoptosis; (c) Tail resorption during amphibian metamorphosis; (d) Elimination of Müllerian duct cells in males (AMH-dependent); (e) Hollow organ lumen formation (e.g., esophagus); (f) Elimination of larval structures in metamorphosing insects.

      "explanation": "The data illustrate the classic morphogen gradient model applied to neural tube patterning: (1) French flag model: Wolpert's French flag model proposes that a morphogen at different concentrations activates different genes and specifies different cell fates — like a gradient of blue dye creating red, white, and blue stripes at different thresholds. The Shh gradient in the neural tube is the best-characterized example of this model in vertebrate development. (2) Gradient formation: Shh is secreted from the notochord and floor plate, forming a ventral-to-dorsal concentration gradient. The gradient is shaped by: (a) diffusion through the extracellular space; (b) binding to the receptor Patched (which both transduces the signal and limits Shh spread); (c) cholesterol and palmitate modifications on Shh that affect its range. (3) Transcription factor code: Different Shh concentrations activate or repress distinct homeodomain and bHLH transcription factors, creating a combinatorial transcription factor code: Class I factors (Pax6, Irx3, Dbx1/2) are repressed by Shh at specific thresholds; Class II factors (Nkx2.2, Olig2, Nkx6.1) are activated by Shh. The boundaries between adjacent progenitor domains are sharpened by mutual cross-repression between Class I and Class II factors in adjacent domains. (4) Temporal dynamics: Recent work shows that Shh signaling duration (not just concentration) contributes to cell fate specification — cells integrate both concentration and exposure time (the 'temporal adaptation' model). (5) Clinical: Mutations affecting Shh signaling cause holoprosencephaly (insufficient Shh) or basal cell carcinoma (constitutive Shh pathway activation).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The three signaling centers of the developing limb bud coordinate growth along the three axes: (1) Apical ectodermal ridge (AER) — proximal-distal axis: The AER is a ridge of thickened ectoderm at the distal margin of the limb bud. It secretes FGFs (primarily FGF8, with contributions from FGF4, FGF9, FGF17) that maintain the underlying mesenchyme in a proliferative, undifferentiated state. Classical experiments by Saunders (1948) showed that AER removal at progressively later stages produces progressively more complete limbs — early removal produces only a humerus, later removal produces humerus + radius/ulna, and latest removal allows full digit formation. This led to the 'progress zone' model — cells leave the progress zone (immediately beneath the AER) as limb growth pushes the AER distally, with their positional identity determined by the time spent in the progress zone. (2) ZPA — anterior-posterior axis: The zone of polarizing activity at the posterior limb margin secretes Shh, specifying digit identity (digit 5 nearest ZPA/highest Shh, digit 2 furthest/lowest Shh). Transplanting ZPA to the anterior margin produces mirror-image digit duplications. (3) Dorsal ectoderm — dorsal-ventral axis: Wnt7a from the dorsal ectoderm induces Lmx1b in the dorsal mesenchyme, specifying dorsal (knuckle/nail) identity. En-1 in the ventral ectoderm represses Wnt7a ventrally, specifying ventral (palm/sole) identity. (4) Positive feedback: AER and ZPA maintain each other — FGFs from AER maintain Shh expression in ZPA, while Shh from ZPA maintains FGF expression in AER via Gremlin-mediated BMP inhibition. This self-sustaining loop drives continued limb outgrowth.",

        "A single gene simultaneously specifies all segment boundaries",
        "Maternal gradients (Bicoid, Nanos) activate gap genes in broad domains, gap genes activate pair-rule genes in alternating stripes, and pair-rule genes activate segment polarity genes in 14 narrow stripes — each level of the hierarchy reads the pattern from the level above and generates a more refined pattern with higher spatial resolution",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Drosophila segmentation cascade is the best-understood example of progressive pattern refinement in biology: (1) Maternal coordinate genes (level 1): Bicoid (anterior morphogen) and Nanos (posterior morphogen) protein gradients provide crude positional information along the A-P axis. Bicoid is a homeodomain transcription factor that directly activates target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) Gap genes (level 2): Maternal gradients activate gap genes (hunchback, Krüppel, knirps, giant) in broad, overlapping domains. Each gap gene is expressed in 1-2 broad regions of the embryo. Gap genes encode transcription factors that both activate and repress each other, sharpening their domain boundaries. Loss of a gap gene eliminates contiguous groups of segments. (3) Pair-rule genes (level 3): Gap gene combinations activate pair-rule genes (hairy, even-skipped, fushi tarazu, runt) in seven alternating stripes. Each stripe is controlled by a separate enhancer element that reads a unique combination of gap gene inputs. For example, the eve stripe 2 enhancer is activated by Bicoid and Hunchback and repressed by Giant and Krüppel — the overlap of activator and repressor domains defines the narrow stripe. (4) Segment polarity genes (level 4): Pair-rule genes activate segment polarity genes (engrailed, wingless, hedgehog) in 14 stripes — one per segment. Engrailed (in posterior cells) and Wingless (in anterior cells of each segment) maintain segment boundaries through reciprocal signaling (Hedgehog-Wingless positive feedback loop). (5) Resolution: From ~3 broad maternal domains → ~4 gap domains → 7 pair-rule stripes → 14 segment polarity stripes. Each level approximately doubles the spatial resolution.",

The key variable is pore size: (a) Large pores (0.4-0.8 μm): Allow cell processes (filopodia, cytonemes) to extend through, enabling both diffusible and contact-dependent signaling; (b) Small pores (0.05-0.1 μm): Allow only small molecules/proteins to diffuse through, blocking cell-cell contact; (c) No filter (sandwich): Direct contact control. (2) Results for neural induction: Classic transfilter experiments by Saxen and others showed that neural induction in amphibians can occur across filters with small pores, suggesting involvement of diffusible signals. We now know these include BMP antagonists (Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin) secreted by the organizer. (3) Contact-dependent signals: Some inductive interactions require direct contact — for example, Delta-Notch signaling (lateral inhibition during neurogenesis) requires membrane-bound ligand-receptor interaction. These signals are blocked by filters of any pore size. (4) Modern interpretation: Many inductive events use a combination of diffusible and contact-dependent signals. Additionally, cytonemes (specialized filopodia) can transport signaling molecules over several cell diameters, blurring the contact vs diffusion distinction. (5) Controls: Including heat-inactivated tissue, conditioned medium alone, and inducer-alone and responder-alone conditions validates the specificity of the interaction.",

        "Cells undergo apoptosis to reshape the tissue during gastrulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Convergent extension (CE) is one of the most important morphogenetic movements in embryogenesis: (1) Mechanism: Cells intercalate — they rearrange by moving between their neighbors. In CE, cells intercalate along the mediolateral axis (perpendicular to the A-P axis), causing the tissue to converge (narrow) along the mediolateral axis and extend (lengthen) along the A-P axis. This transforms a short, wide tissue into a long, narrow one without cell division or changes in cell number. (2) Molecular control: CE is driven by the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, also known as the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Key components include: Wnt11, Dishevelled (Dsh), Strabismus/Van Gogh (Vangl2), Prickle, Flamingo/Celsr, and downstream effectors RhoA and Rac1 (small GTPases). PCP signaling polarizes cells, generating mediolaterally oriented protrusions (lamellipodia) that drive intercalation. (3) Gastrulation: CE drives the elongation of the body axis during gastrulation. In Xenopus, CE of the involuting marginal zone (prospective notochord and somitic mesoderm) is the major force driving body axis elongation. In zebrafish, CE also drives the convergence of lateral mesoderm toward the dorsal midline. (4) Neural tube closure: CE also operates during neural tube closure, narrowing and lengthening the neural plate. Mutations in PCP pathway genes (e.g., Vangl2 in the Looptail mouse) cause failure of neural tube closure (craniorachischisis). (5) Human disease: Human mutations in PCP genes (VANGL1/2, CELSR1, SCRIB) are associated with neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stem cell potency hierarchy is fundamental to understanding developmental and regenerative biology: (1) Totipotent: The zygote and cells up to approximately the 8-cell stage (in humans) are totipotent — they can give rise to ALL cell types of the organism, including both embryonic (all three germ layers) and extraembryonic tissues (trophoblast/placenta, yolk sac). The ability to form trophoblast distinguishes totipotency from pluripotency. After compaction, cells become allocated to inner cell mass (ICM) or trophectoderm. (2) Pluripotent: ICM cells of the blastocyst (and derived embryonic stem cells, ESCs) are pluripotent — they can differentiate into all cell types of the embryo proper (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) but cannot independently form trophoblast or a complete organism. The gold standard test for pluripotency is tetraploid complementation — injecting pluripotent cells into tetraploid blastocysts (where host cells can only contribute to extraembryonic tissues) produces an animal entirely derived from the injected cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) created by Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) demonstrate artificially restored pluripotency. (3) Multipotent: Tissue-specific stem cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types within a lineage. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent — they generate all blood cell types but not liver, brain, etc. Neural stem cells produce neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. (4) Unipotent: Progenitor cells committed to a single cell type, such as spermatogonial stem cells (generating only sperm) or satellite cells (generating only skeletal muscle).",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Sea urchin gastrulation involves invagination of the vegetal plate, forming the archenteron. This occurs in two phases: primary invagination (buckling of the vegetal plate driven by cell shape changes — apical constriction and cell wedging) and secondary invagination (extension of the archenteron by convergent extension and filopodial traction from secondary mesenchyme cells at the archenteron tip that pull toward the animal pole). Primary mesenchyme cells (from micromere descendants) had already ingressed into the blastocoel before invagination begins. (II) TRUE — Drosophila mesoderm formation is driven by ventral furrow invagination. Twist and Snail (transcription factors activated by nuclear Dorsal) are expressed in the ventral-most cells. Twist activates fog (folded gastrulation) and T48, which activate RhoGEF2 and myosin II to cause apical constriction. Snail represses ectodermal genes. The coordinated apical constriction of ~1000 ventral cells creates the ventral furrow, which folds inward, bringing mesoderm precursors into the interior. (III) TRUE — In amniotes (birds, reptiles, mammals), the primitive streak is the site of gastrulation. Epiblast cells converge toward the streak, undergo EMT (losing E-cadherin, gaining N-cadherin and vimentin), and ingress through the streak. Cells that ingress early and migrate anteriorly form definitive endoderm (replacing the hypoblast). Later-ingressing cells form mesoderm. The anterior tip of the streak (Hensen's node) is equivalent to Spemann's organizer. (IV) FALSE — Gastrulation mechanisms vary dramatically based on egg size, yolk content, and evolutionary lineage. Holoblastic cleavage animals (sea urchins, frogs) use invagination and involution. Meroblastic (partial) cleavage animals (birds, reptiles with large yolky eggs) use the primitive streak. Drosophila uses ventral furrow formation. Each mechanism is adapted to the specific constraints of the egg.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Left-right (L-R) axis specification is one of the last steps in establishing the body plan and involves a remarkable ciliary mechanism: (1) Nodal cilia: The ventral surface of the node (a transient pit-like structure at the anterior end of the primitive streak in mice, equivalent to Kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish) is lined with approximately 200 motile monocilia. Each cilium is posteriorly tilted (~40° from vertical) and rotates clockwise when viewed from above. (2) Nodal flow: Due to the posterior tilt, the effective stroke of each cilium sweeps leftward near the cell surface (where friction is high) while the recovery stroke occurs higher up (where there is less friction). This generates a net leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid across the node at approximately 5-10 μm/s. (3) Signal transduction — two models: (a) Morphogen transport model: Nodal flow sweeps morphogen-containing vesicles (NVPs, nodal vesicular parcels) or free morphogens to the left side, directly activating left-side receptors. (b) Two-cilia model: Immotile mechanosensory cilia on the left periphery of the node detect the leftward flow and transduce a calcium signal through polycystin-2 (PC2) channels. Current evidence supports both mechanisms. (4) Downstream cascade: Leftward flow activates Nodal (a TGF-beta family ligand) expression on the left side of the node, which propagates to the left lateral plate mesoderm. Left-side Nodal activates Pitx2 (a homeodomain transcription factor) and Lefty2 (which limits Nodal signaling). Pitx2 directs left-specific morphogenesis (heart looping, gut rotation, spleen position). (5) Clinical: Mutations in cilia genes (dynein, IFT components) cause primary ciliary dyskinesia/Kartagener syndrome with situs inversus (50% probability of reversed L-R asymmetry).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The default model of neural induction fundamentally changed our understanding of how the nervous system forms: (1) Historical context: Spemann and Mangold showed that the organizer induces neural tissue. For decades, researchers searched for the 'neural inducing' signal. The surprising answer was that neural fate is the default state of ectoderm, and the organizer's role is to REMOVE an inhibitory signal (BMP). (2) Key experiments: (a) Dissociated animal cap cells (prospective epidermis) become neural tissue in isolation — because cell dissociation dilutes BMP signals. (b) Dominant-negative BMP receptors expressed in ventral ectoderm (which normally becomes epidermis) convert it to neural tissue. (c) Injecting BMP into dorsal ectoderm (which normally becomes neural) converts it to epidermis. (3) BMP antagonists: The organizer secretes three BMP antagonists: Chordin (binds BMP4 directly, preventing receptor binding), Noggin (binds BMPs with high affinity), and Follistatin (binds Activin and BMP). These create a dorsal zone of low BMP signaling where ectoderm adopts neural fate. (4) Refinements: The strict default model is now modified. FGF signaling and Wnt inhibition (via secreted frizzled-related proteins, sFRPs, from the organizer) also contribute to neural induction. FGF may sensitize ectoderm to BMP antagonism by reducing BMP receptor levels. Thus, neural induction involves the coordinated inhibition of BMP, Wnt, and potentially Nodal signaling. (5) A-P patterning: After initial neural induction (all neural tissue is initially anterior/forebrain), posterior neural identities (hindbrain, spinal cord) are imposed by caudalizing signals: Wnt, FGF, and retinoic acid from posterior mesoderm.",

      "explanation": "These experiments elegantly dissect the epistatic relationship between RA and Shh in limb patterning: (1) Control: Normal chick wing has digits 2-3-4 (anterior to posterior). Digit 4 is closest to the ZPA (zone of polarizing activity, which produces Shh at the posterior margin). (2) RA and Shh mimic ZPA: Both RA beads and Shh beads placed at the anterior margin produce the same result — mirror-image digit duplication (4-3-2-2-3-4). This suggests they act on the same pathway. (3) Critical experiment — epistasis: When RA is blocked (RA inhibitor BMS493) but Shh is provided directly, duplication still occurs. This shows Shh acts downstream of RA and can function independently. Conversely, when Shh is blocked (cyclopamine, a Smoothened inhibitor) but RA is provided, duplication is abolished. This proves RA requires Shh to produce digit duplication — RA's effect is mediated through Shh. (4) Mechanism: RA activates Shh transcription by inducing the 5' HoxD genes (Hoxd10-13) in ectopic anterior mesenchyme. These Hox proteins, together with the limb-specific enhancer ZRS (zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence), activate Shh expression. Thus, RA creates an ectopic ZPA. (5) Epistatic hierarchy: RA → HoxD gene activation → Shh induction → digit specification. RA is upstream, Shh is the effector.

Instead, it induces the overlying dorsal marginal zone (equatorial region) to become the Spemann organizer through Nodal (Xnr) signaling. VegT activates Nodal-related genes (Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4, Xnr5, Xnr6) throughout the vegetal hemisphere, but the highest levels of Nodal signaling occur dorsally where beta-catenin synergizes with VegT to activate Siamois and Twin, which further boost Nodal expression.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lateral inhibition via Delta-Notch signaling is one of the most fundamental patterning mechanisms in biology: (1) The problem: In the neuroectoderm, all cells initially have the potential to become neurons or remain as epidermis/glia. How do individual cells 'choose' to become neurons while their neighbors do not? (2) Delta-Notch mechanism: Initially, all cells in the proneural cluster express both Delta (ligand) and Notch (receptor) at equivalent levels. Small stochastic fluctuations mean some cells express slightly more Delta than their neighbors. These cells more strongly activate Notch on neighbors, upregulating Hes/Her genes (transcriptional repressors) that suppress Delta expression and proneural genes (Neurogenin, Achaete-Scute). The Notch-activated cells thus produce less Delta, further freeing the high-Delta cell from Notch activation. (3) Positive feedback: This creates a self-amplifying loop — the nascent neuroblast expresses progressively more Delta and less Notch, while surrounding cells express progressively more Notch target genes and less Delta. The result is a salt-and-pepper pattern of differentiated cells (neurons) surrounded by inhibited cells (progenitors/glia). (4) Molecular details: Notch is a single-pass transmembrane receptor. Delta/Serrate (Jagged in mammals) binding triggers proteolytic cleavage: ADAM metalloprotease cleaves the extracellular domain, then gamma-secretase cleaves the transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and activates CSL/RBP-J transcription factors with Mastermind co-activator. (5) Universality: Delta-Notch lateral inhibition operates in many tissues: hair cells vs supporting cells in the inner ear, secretory vs absorptive cells in the gut, arterial vs venous endothelial cells, and T cell lineage decisions.",

      "explanation": "Demonstrating that a gene is necessary for a developmental process requires loss-of-function analysis with appropriate controls: (1) Loss-of-function: CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing creates heritable null mutations by introducing frameshift insertions/deletions in the coding sequence. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides provide a complementary, rapid approach by blocking translation (ATG morpholino) or splicing (splice-site morpholino) of the target mRNA. Using both approaches in parallel strengthens the evidence. (2) Phenotype documentation: Heart development in zebrafish is directly observable due to embryo transparency. Key parameters to assess: cardiac morphology (linear heart tube formation, looping, chamber formation), contractility (heart rate, fractional shortening by video analysis), valve formation, and blood circulation. Molecular markers (nkx2.5, gata4, hand2 for cardiac progenitors; vmhc, amhc for ventricle/atrium) can be assessed by in situ hybridization. (3) Rescue experiment: This is the critical control. Injecting wild-type Gene Y mRNA into Gene Y knockout/knockdown embryos should restore normal heart development. If it does, this proves: (a) the phenotype is specifically caused by Gene Y loss (not off-target effects), and (b) Gene Y protein is sufficient to rescue. Rescue with a tagged version (Gene Y-GFP) can additionally show protein localization.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Regeneration mechanisms differ fundamentally between organisms and tissues: (1) Epimorphic regeneration (salamander limb): After limb amputation, wound epidermis (without a basement membrane) forms within hours. The wound epidermis signals to underlying stump tissues, causing mature cells (muscle, cartilage, connective tissue) to dedifferentiate — losing their specialized characteristics and re-entering the cell cycle. These dedifferentiated cells form a blastema, a mass of proliferating progenitor-like cells at the amputation plane. Blastema cells then re-differentiate in a pattern that recapitulates embryonic limb development, regenerating all missing structures (skeleton, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, skin) with proper patterning. Key molecular players include FGF (from wound epidermis), nAG (produced by regenerating nerves), and reactivation of developmental pathways (Shh, Wnt, BMP). (2) Compensatory regeneration (mammalian liver): After partial hepatectomy (removal of up to 70% of liver mass), remaining hepatocytes (which are normally quiescent, in G0) re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate. The liver regrows to its original mass within 1-2 weeks, but does NOT regenerate the original lobular architecture or missing lobes. Instead, remaining lobes enlarge (hypertrophy and hyperplasia). Key signals include HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), EGF, and TNF-alpha/IL-6 priming. (3) Morphallaxis (Hydra): A third type — regeneration through remodeling and re-patterning of existing tissue with minimal new cell proliferation. (4) Mammals have very limited epimorphic capacity — neonatal mouse digit tips can regenerate (involving a blastema), but this capacity is lost with age.",

      "explanation": "The discovery of iPSCs by Shinya Yamanaka (2006) revolutionized stem cell biology and earned the 2012 Nobel Prize: (1) The factors: Yamanaka screened 24 candidate pluripotency-associated transcription factors and identified a minimal set of four that could reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotency: (a) Oct4 (Pou5f1): A POU-domain transcription factor essential for maintaining pluripotency in the ICM and ESCs. It activates pluripotency genes and represses differentiation genes. (b) Sox2: A SRY-related HMG-box transcription factor that partners with Oct4 to co-regulate many pluripotency target genes. Oct4-Sox2 heterodimers bind composite elements in enhancers of genes like Nanog. (c) Klf4: A Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor that activates pluripotency genes and inhibits p53-mediated senescence. (d) c-Myc: An oncogenic transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation, chromatin remodeling (histone acetylation), and telomerase activity. c-Myc was later shown to be replaceable, and iPSCs can be generated without it (though less efficiently). (2) Mechanism: Reprogramming involves massive epigenetic remodeling — demethylation of pluripotency gene promoters (Oct4, Nanog), reactivation of the inactive X chromosome in female cells, chromatin remodeling from heterochromatin to euchromatin at stem cell genes, and telomere elongation. (3) Validation: iPSCs meet key pluripotency criteria — they form teratomas (tumors containing all three germ layers), contribute to chimeric mice when injected into blastocysts, and can pass the tetraploid complementation test (generating entire mice from iPSCs). (4) Applications: iPSCs enable patient-specific disease modeling, drug screening, and potentially personalized cell therapy without immune rejection concerns.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Neurulation (formation of the neural tube from the neural plate) involves coordinated cell shape changes and tissue movements: (1) Neural plate bending: The neural plate bends at specific 'hinge points' — the median hinge point (MHP, at the midline overlying the notochord) and dorsolateral hinge points (DLHPs, lateral to the midline). At these hinge points, neuroepithelial cells undergo apical constriction — contraction of the actin-myosin network at their apical surface transforms them from columnar to wedge-shaped (wide basally, narrow apically). This collectively bends the epithelial sheet. (2) Molecular mechanism: Shh signaling from the notochord induces MHP formation by upregulating Shh target genes in floor plate precursors. Apical constriction is driven by RhoA-ROCK-myosin II signaling. The apical surface accumulates phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC), generating contractile force. Additionally, PAR-3/PAR-6/aPKC apical polarity proteins help organize the actomyosin network. (3) Elevation and convergence: After bending at hinge points, the neural folds elevate (rise) bilaterally, converge at the dorsal midline, and fuse to form the closed neural tube. Non-neural ectoderm also contributes by pushing the folds medially (extrinsic forces). (4) Closure sites: In mammals, neural tube closure initiates at multiple sites. In humans, closure begins at the cervical region and proceeds bidirectionally (both cranially and caudally). Failure of closure produces neural tube defects — anencephaly (cranial) or spina bifida (caudal). (5) Secondary neurulation: In the most caudal region (sacral/coccygeal), the neural tube forms by cavitation of a solid cord of mesenchymal cells, rather than by folding of a neural plate.",

        "MZT is the process by which the embryo receives nutrients from the mother via the placenta"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The maternal-to-zygotic transition is one of the most dramatic reprogramming events in biology: (1) Maternal control: Early embryonic development is directed entirely by maternally deposited mRNAs and proteins stockpiled in the egg during oogenesis. In Drosophila, the first 13 nuclear divisions occur without any zygotic transcription. In zebrafish, MZT occurs at the 1000-cell stage (~3 hours). In humans, ZGA begins at the 4-8 cell stage (day 2-3). (2) Two components: MZT involves two concurrent processes: (a) Maternal mRNA clearance: Maternal transcripts are degraded by both maternal factors (e.g., Smaug, which recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to maternal mRNAs in Drosophila) and zygotic factors (microRNAs, particularly miR-430 in zebrafish and miR-427 in Xenopus, which trigger deadenylation and decay of hundreds of maternal transcripts). (b) Zygotic genome activation (ZGA): The embryonic genome becomes transcriptionally active. This involves chromatin remodeling — the initially transcriptionally repressive chromatin (high nucleosome density, repressive histone marks) is remodeled to an active state. Pioneer transcription factors (e.g., Zelda/VIELFALTIG in Drosophila, Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 in mammals, Pou5f3/SoxB1/Nanog in zebrafish) open chromatin and initiate zygotic transcription. (3) Timing regulation: The timing of ZGA is regulated by the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio — as cleavage progresses, the increasing number of nuclei titrates out a cytoplasmic repressor of transcription. In Drosophila and Xenopus, this has been linked to histone availability. (4) Importance: Failure of MZT causes developmental arrest. Understanding MZT is critical for improving IVF/ICSI outcomes, where embryonic arrest at the cleavage stage correlates with ZGA failure.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "These classic Drosophila Hox mutants demonstrate fundamental principles of homeotic gene function: (1) Homeotic transformation: Hox genes specify segment identity — they do not create segments (that is done by the segmentation cascade) but instead tell each segment WHAT it should become. Mutations cause homeotic transformations — one segment takes on the identity of another. (2) Loss-of-function → posterior-to-anterior transformation: When a Hox gene is lost, its segment loses its specified identity and defaults to a more anterior identity (the ground state without that Hox gene's instruction). Ubx loss-of-function: T3 segment lacks Ubx instruction, so it adopts T2 identity — the haltere (balancing organ) becomes a wing, producing Bateson's famous 4-winged fly. Abd-B loss-of-function: posterior abdominal segments lose their posterior identity and adopt more anterior abdominal identities. (3) Gain-of-function → anterior-to-posterior transformation: When a Hox gene is ectopically expressed in anterior segments, it imposes a more posterior identity. Antennapedia gain-of-function: Antp is normally expressed in T2 (leg segments). When ectopically expressed in the head (where antenna-specifying genes normally act), it transforms antennae into legs — one of the most iconic mutant phenotypes in genetics. (4) Posterior prevalence: When multiple Hox genes are expressed in the same region, the more posterior (5') Hox gene dominates — explaining why gain-of-function always produces posteriorization. (5) Regulatory mutations: The bithoraxoid (bxd) mutation affects Ubx regulatory sequences (not the coding sequence), causing reduced Ubx expression in part of T3 and partial T3→T2 transformation. This demonstrates that Hox gene regulation is as important as the protein itself.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is the earliest zygotic signaling event in vertebrate axis determination: (1) Cortical rotation: In Xenopus, fertilization triggers cortical rotation — a 30-degree rotation of the egg cortex relative to the cytoplasm, driven by parallel arrays of microtubules. This transports Dishevelled (Dsh) protein and GBP (GSK-3 Binding Protein) from the vegetal pole to the dorsal side. (2) Beta-catenin stabilization: On the dorsal side, transported Dsh and GBP inhibit GSK-3beta, which normally phosphorylates beta-catenin (targeting it for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation via the APC destruction complex). Dorsal GSK-3 inhibition allows beta-catenin to accumulate, enter the nucleus, and partner with TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate dorsal target genes. On the ventral side, GSK-3 remains active, beta-catenin is degraded, and TCF acts as a repressor. (3) Target genes: Nuclear beta-catenin + TCF activates Siamois and Twin (homeodomain transcription factors that are master regulators of organizer formation), Nodal-related genes (Xnr3, Xnr5, Xnr6), and Wnt8 (which maintains dorsal signaling). Siamois directly activates organizer genes including Goosecoid, Chordin, and Noggin. (4) Proof: Injection of beta-catenin mRNA into ventral blastomeres induces a secondary axis (dorsalization). Injection of dominant-negative TCF or depletion of beta-catenin prevents organizer formation (ventralization). Lithium chloride (which inhibits GSK-3) ventrally causes dorsalization of the entire embryo.

        "Regulative and mosaic development are identical processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The regulative-mosaic distinction, while a simplification, captures a fundamental difference in developmental strategy: (1) Regulative development: In regulative embryos, cells are not irreversibly committed to specific fates early in development. They receive positional information from cell-cell interactions (induction) and can adjust their fate based on context. Key evidence: if one blastomere is removed from a 4-cell sea urchin or mammalian embryo, the remaining cells compensate and a complete (albeit smaller) organism develops. Similarly, two 2-cell embryos combined can form a single, normal-sized chimeric organism. This capacity for regulation underlies identical twinning in mammals and the ability to perform preimplantation genetic testing (removing cells for biopsy without harming the embryo). (2) Mosaic development: In mosaic embryos, cell fates are determined by asymmetrically distributed cytoplasmic determinants (mRNAs, proteins) that are partitioned to specific blastomeres during cleavage. Removing a blastomere results in a partial embryo missing the structures normally derived from that cell. Classical example: in ascidians (tunicates), yellow crescent cytoplasm contains macho-1 mRNA (muscle determinant). If the blastomere receiving this cytoplasm is removed, no muscle forms. C. elegans also shows strong mosaic features — the invariant cell lineage reflects autonomous specification by localized determinants (PIE-1, SKN-1, PAL-1, P granules). (3) Spectrum: Most organisms use a combination of both modes. Sea urchins were considered regulative but have mosaic features (micromere specification). C. elegans was considered mosaic but uses induction (P2-EMS signaling). Mammals are highly regulative early but become increasingly mosaic as development proceeds.",

      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Cadherins (E-cadherin/CDH1, N-cadherin/CDH2, P-cadherin/CDH3, VE-cadherin/CDH5, etc.) are type I transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion through homophilic (like-to-like) trans-interactions between their extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. Calcium ions rigidify the EC domain linker regions, enabling binding. Intracellularly, cadherins link to the actin cytoskeleton through alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and p120-catenin, forming adherens junctions. (II) TRUE — The differential adhesion hypothesis (Steinberg, 1963) proposes that cells sort based on quantitative and qualitative differences in cell adhesion. Cells expressing different cadherins (E-cadherin vs N-cadherin) segregate when mixed in culture, with the more adhesive cells (higher cadherin expression) forming the inner core and less adhesive cells forming the outer layer. This principle explains tissue boundary formation during development — for example, the segregation of neural tube (N-cadherin) from epidermis (E-cadherin). (III) TRUE — During EMT, cells switch from E-cadherin (epithelial adhesion) to N-cadherin (mesenchymal adhesion). This 'cadherin switch' is driven by transcriptional repressors Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1/2, which directly repress CDH1 (E-cadherin gene) promoter. Neural crest cells undergo this switch during delamination from the neural tube. The same E-to-N cadherin switch occurs during cancer metastasis, enabling tumor cells to detach from the primary tumor and invade surrounding tissues. (IV) FALSE — Cadherins participate in multiple signaling pathways: (a) beta-catenin, released from cadherin complexes, can enter the nucleus and act as a Wnt signaling effector; (b) p120-catenin regulates Rho GTPase activity; (c) Cadherins modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR, EGFR) through direct interactions; (d) Cadherin engagement activates contact-inhibition-of-proliferation signals (Hippo pathway).

      "explanation": "Planarian neoblasts are among the most remarkable stem cells in the animal kingdom: (1) Identity: Neoblasts are adult somatic stem cells that constitute approximately 25-30% of planarian cells. They are the ONLY mitotically active cells in the adult planarian — all differentiated cells are post-mitotic. Neoblasts are small, undifferentiated cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, scattered throughout the parenchyma (but excluded from the pharynx and in front of the photoreceptors). (2) Pluripotency: Individual neoblasts are clonally pluripotent, as demonstrated by the landmark experiment of Wagner et al. (2011): a single transplanted neoblast (cNeoblast) into a lethally irradiated planarian (which destroys all host neoblasts) can repopulate the entire animal, generating all cell types including neurons, intestine, muscle, epidermis, and excretory cells. This is arguably the most extreme demonstration of adult stem cell potency in any animal. (3) Regeneration: When a planarian is cut (even into 1/279th of its body), neoblasts at the wound site proliferate, forming a blastema. Wnt signaling determines head vs tail fate — Wnt is high posteriorly (promoting tail), and Wnt inhibition is high anteriorly (promoting head). Beta-catenin knockdown causes all wounds to regenerate heads (producing 'two-headed' planarians). (4) Molecular markers: Neoblasts express piwi (piRNA pathway component), vasa, and other germline-associated genes. They are sensitive to irradiation (lethal dose eliminates all neoblasts and eventually kills the animal as differentiated cells cannot be replaced). (5) Heterogeneity: Recent single-cell sequencing reveals neoblast heterogeneity — some are true pluripotent stem cells while others are lineage-committed progenitors.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Amphibian metamorphosis is one of the most dramatic post-embryonic developmental events in vertebrates, entirely orchestrated by thyroid hormones: (1) Thyroid hormone (TH): The onset of metamorphosis is triggered by a surge in circulating T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), produced by the thyroid gland under stimulation from TSH (from the pituitary) and ultimately TRH (from the hypothalamus). TH levels rise progressively during prometamorphosis and peak during metamorphic climax. (2) Mechanism: TH binds to thyroid hormone receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta), which are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Unliganded TRs repress target genes (maintaining the larval state); upon TH binding, TRs recruit coactivators and activate metamorphic gene programs. (3) Tissue-specific responses: Remarkably, the same hormone produces opposite effects in different tissues: (a) Limbs — TH stimulates cell proliferation and morphogenesis, growing the legs; (b) Tail — TH induces apoptosis and tissue resorption, eliminating the tail; (c) Intestine — the larval gut (simple herbivore intestine) undergoes massive remodeling to a shorter, more complex carnivore gut via apoptosis of larval epithelium and proliferation of adult stem cells; (d) Skin — transition from larval to adult skin with mucous glands; (e) Hemoglobin — switch from larval hemoglobin (higher O2 affinity for aquatic respiration) to adult hemoglobin (optimized for air breathing); (f) Brain — remodeling of the visual system from lateral-eyed to binocular. (4) Proof: Thyroidectomy prevents metamorphosis. Treatment of tadpoles with exogenous TH induces precocious metamorphosis. Blocking TH synthesis with propylthiouracil halts metamorphosis.",

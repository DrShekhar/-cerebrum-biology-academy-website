      "explanation": "In approximately 95% of right-handed individuals and ~70% of left-handed individuals, the left hemisphere is dominant for language. Key language areas include: (1) Broca's area (left inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann areas 44-45)\u2014involved in speech production and grammar; damage causes Broca's aphasia (non-fluent speech with preserved comprehension). (2) Wernicke's area (left superior temporal gyrus, Brodmann area 22)\u2014involved in language comprehension; damage causes Wernicke's aphasia (fluent but meaningless speech with impaired comprehension). (3) The arcuate fasciculus connects these areas. Evidence for lateralization comes from split-brain patients (corpus callosum severed), Wada test (intracarotid amobarbital injection), and functional imaging.",

(2) Subgranular zone (SGZ)\u2014in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, neural stem cells produce granule cells that integrate into existing circuits and are thought to contribute to learning and memory. In humans, hippocampal neurogenesis has been demonstrated using carbon-14 dating of neuronal DNA (from nuclear weapons testing fallout) and thymidine analog incorporation, though its extent remains debated.

      "explanation": "Overcoming the BBB is a major challenge in neuropharmacology, with multiple strategies: (1) Lipophilic modification: Small, lipophilic, uncharged molecules (<400 Da, >8 hydrogen bonds) cross by passive transcellular diffusion. L-DOPA (levodopa) crosses via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), unlike dopamine itself. (2) Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT): Drugs conjugated to antibodies targeting transferrin receptor, LRP1, or insulin receptor undergo transcytosis across endothelial cells. Bispecific antibodies targeting both a BBB receptor and a brain target are in clinical trials. (3) Focused ultrasound (FUS) + microbubbles: Ultrasound oscillates gas-filled microbubbles in brain capillaries, transiently disrupting tight junctions in a targeted region. Reversible, non-invasive, and in clinical trials for Alzheimer disease. (4) Intranasal delivery: Some drugs can reach the brain via olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways. (5) Intrathecal/intraventricular injection: Direct CSF delivery bypasses the BBB entirely but is invasive. (6) Nanoparticle carriers with surface modifications can also enhance BBB penetration.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Synaptic scaling (Turrigiano & Nelson, 1998) is a form of homeostatic plasticity that maintains network stability: (1) If a neuron's activity is chronically decreased (e.g., by TTX blockade), it globally scales up all excitatory synaptic strengths (by inserting more AMPA receptors) to restore firing rates. (2) If activity is chronically increased, synaptic strengths are globally scaled down. (3) This multiplicative scaling preserves relative synaptic weights (and thus information) while adjusting overall excitability. (4) The mechanism involves: sensing of average firing rate via calcium levels, regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking, and TNF-alpha signaling from glia. Synaptic homeostasis complements Hebbian plasticity (LTP/LTD), which strengthens specific synapses but could destabilize networks without homeostatic counterbalance.",

      "explanation": "The fMRI BOLD signal is an indirect measure of neural activity based on the neurovascular coupling principle: (1) Active neurons increase their metabolic demand and consume oxygen. (2) This triggers a local increase in cerebral blood flow (hemodynamic response), which overcompensates, delivering more oxygenated blood than is consumed. (3) The ratio of deoxyhemoglobin (paramagnetic, distorts MRI signal) to oxyhemoglobin (diamagnetic) decreases in active areas. (4) This change in magnetic properties produces the BOLD contrast detectable by MRI. The BOLD signal is delayed by 4-6 seconds after neural activity onset and has limited temporal resolution (~1-2 seconds) compared to EEG or MEG (millisecond resolution).

This combination\u2014active brain, paralyzed body\u2014is consistent with vivid dreaming: the cortex generates complex visual and emotional experiences (dreams) while motor output is inhibited (preventing acting out dreams).

      "explanation": "Neural coding refers to how the nervous system represents information: (1) Rate coding (Adrian, 1926): Information is encoded in the mean firing rate of a neuron averaged over a time window (typically 100-500 ms). Stronger stimuli produce higher firing rates. This is well-established for sensory encoding (e.g., stronger pressure = higher firing rate in mechanoreceptors). (2) Temporal coding: Information is encoded in the precise timing of spikes (millisecond precision) or in temporal patterns. Examples include: phase-locked firing in auditory neurons (encoding sound frequency), synchronization between neurons (binding features of a visual object), and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). (3) Population coding: Information is distributed across a population of neurons, with each neuron's response contributing a \"vote\" (e.g., Georgopoulos population vector for motor cortex direction coding).

If silencing the circuit during fear conditioning prevents learning, the circuit is necessary.

(2) Pruning: Activity-dependent mechanisms selectively eliminate weak or unused synapses while strengthening active ones (\"use it or lose it\").

Neglect is more common and severe with right hemisphere damage because spatial attention is more lateralized to the right hemisphere, which attends to both sides, while the left hemisphere primarily attends to the right.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The mesolimbic dopamine pathway is central to reward and addiction: (1) Origin: Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain. (2) Projections: Nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum\u2014the primary \"reward center\"; prefrontal cortex (PFC)\u2014decision-making and impulse control; amygdala\u2014emotional associations; hippocampus\u2014contextual memory. (3) Natural rewards (food, sex, social interaction) transiently increase dopamine release in the NAc. (4) Drugs of abuse hijack this system: cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter (DAT), amphetamine reverses DAT to release dopamine, opioids disinhibit VTA dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting GABAergic interneurons, nicotine directly activates VTA neurons via nicotinic ACh receptors. (5) Addiction involves: tolerance (reduced response requiring more drug), dependence (withdrawal symptoms), and compulsive drug-seeking despite negative consequences. (6) Long-term changes include altered synaptic plasticity in the NAc and PFC, and reduced D2 receptor density.",

      "question": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) selectively degenerates motor neurons. The disease affects both upper motor neurons (in the motor cortex) and lower motor neurons (in the brainstem and spinal cord). What combination of symptoms distinguishes ALS from a pure upper motor neuron or pure lower motor neuron disease?",
      "options": [
        "Only sensory deficits without motor impairment",
        "ALS uniquely presents with both upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron signs (muscle atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia) in the same patient, often in different body regions simultaneously",
        "Complete loss of consciousness with preserved motor function",
        "Exclusively autonomic dysfunction without somatic motor involvement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "ALS demonstrates mixed UMN and LMN pathology: (1) Upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration produces: spasticity (increased muscle tone), hyperreflexia (exaggerated stretch reflexes), and Babinski sign (extensor plantar response)\u2014because descending inhibitory control of spinal reflexes is lost. (2) Lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration produces: muscle weakness and atrophy (denervation atrophy), fasciculations (spontaneous firing of denervated motor units), fibrillations (on EMG), and eventually hyporeflexia/areflexia in severely denervated segments. (3) The hallmark of ALS is the co-occurrence of both UMN and LMN signs, which is unique among motor neuron diseases. (4) Progression: Symptoms typically begin focally (limb or bulbar onset) and spread to other regions. Respiratory muscle involvement is the usual cause of death (median survival 3-5 years). (5) Sensory neurons, oculomotor neurons, and autonomic neurons are relatively spared. (6) ~10% of cases are familial, with mutations in SOD1, C9orf72, TDP-43, and FUS being most common.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Layer IV (internal granular layer) is the primary target of thalamocortical afferents in primary sensory cortices (V1, S1, A1). Thalamic relay neurons (from the LGN for vision, VPM/VPL for somatosensory, MGN for auditory) send their axons primarily to layer IV, where they synapse on stellate (granule) cells and local interneurons. In primary visual cortex (V1), layer IV is subdivided into IVA, IVB, IVCalpha, and IVCbeta, with the magnocellular LGN pathway terminating in IVCalpha and the parvocellular pathway in IVCbeta. Layer IV then projects to layers II/III (supragranular), which project to other cortical areas (corticocortical connections). Layer V contains large pyramidal neurons that project subcortically (to brainstem, spinal cord, striatum). Layer VI projects back to the thalamus (corticothalamic feedback). This canonical circuit motif is modified in different cortical regions \u2014 motor cortex has a thin layer IV because it receives less sensory input.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The BBB is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells that differ fundamentally from peripheral endothelial cells: (1) Continuous tight junctions (claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1) seal the paracellular space, preventing passive diffusion between cells. (2) Low rates of transcytosis (pinocytosis) compared to peripheral endothelium. (3) Expression of specific transporters: GLUT1 for glucose, LAT1 for amino acids, transferrin receptor for iron, and efflux transporters (P-glycoprotein/MDR1, BCRP) that pump out lipophilic molecules. (4) Astrocytic end-feet ensheath >99% of the capillary surface and release signals (VEGF, Shh, angiopoietin-1) that induce and maintain BBB properties. (5) Pericytes embedded in the capillary basement membrane regulate BBB integrity, capillary diameter, and immune surveillance. Only small lipophilic molecules (<400 Da, <8 hydrogen bonds) readily cross the BBB by passive diffusion (e.g., O2, CO2, ethanol, nicotine). This is a major challenge for CNS drug delivery.",

The medial EC (spatial/grid cells) and lateral EC (object/context information) provide different types of input. (2) Synapse 2 (Mossy fibers): DG granule cells project via large mossy fiber boutons to CA3 pyramidal neurons. This is a powerful detonator synapse with very high release probability.

CA1 neurons then project to the subiculum and deep layers of EC (layer V), completing the loop. CA3 also has extensive recurrent collaterals (autoassociative network) important for pattern completion.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "H.M.'s case (surgery performed by William Scoville in 1953, studied extensively by Brenda Milner) is the most important case study in the neuroscience of memory. After bilateral removal of the medial temporal lobes (including hippocampus, amygdala, and surrounding cortex), H.M. developed profound anterograde amnesia \u2014 he could not form any new declarative (explicit) memories (episodic or semantic). His working memory was intact (he could hold information for seconds), and he retained most memories from before surgery (though with some retrograde amnesia for several years preceding surgery). Critically, H.M. could learn new motor skills (mirror tracing, pursuit rotor) and showed normal priming effects, demonstrating that procedural/implicit memory systems (involving the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and neocortex) are independent of the medial temporal lobe. This double dissociation established the modern framework of multiple memory systems and demonstrated that the hippocampus is essential for memory consolidation, not storage.",

      "options": [
        "The direct pathway excites the motor cortex directly through glutamatergic projections",
        "In the direct pathway, cortical excitation of D1-receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons causes GABAergic inhibition of the globus pallidus internus (GPi)/substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), disinhibiting the thalamus, which then excites the motor cortex \u2014 facilitating movement",

        "The direct pathway activates spinal cord motor neurons directly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The direct pathway is a double-inhibitory circuit that facilitates desired movements: (1) Cortex sends glutamatergic excitation to the striatum (caudate/putamen). (2) Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the direct pathway express D1 dopamine receptors and project GABAergically to the GPi/SNr (output nuclei of basal ganglia). (3) GPi/SNr normally provides tonic GABAergic inhibition of the thalamus (VA/VL nuclei). (4) When direct pathway MSNs are activated, they inhibit GPi/SNr, releasing (disinhibiting) the thalamus from inhibition. (5) Disinhibited thalamus sends glutamatergic excitation to the motor cortex, facilitating movement. The indirect pathway (D2-expressing MSNs \u2192 external GP \u2192 STN \u2192 GPi/SNr) has the opposite effect \u2014 it increases GPi/SNr output and suppresses movement. Dopamine from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) facilitates the direct pathway (via D1 excitation) and suppresses the indirect pathway (via D2 inhibition). In Parkinson's disease, dopamine loss causes underactivity of the direct pathway and overactivity of the indirect pathway, producing bradykinesia and rigidity.",

      "options": [
        "Both divisions use acetylcholine at all synapses",

        "The neurotransmitter depends on the target organ, not the division"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ANS neurotransmitter organization follows a consistent pattern: All preganglionic neurons (both sympathetic and parasympathetic) release ACh at nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on postganglionic neurons. The divisions diverge at postganglionic neurons: Sympathetic postganglionic neurons primarily release norepinephrine (NE) acting on adrenergic receptors (alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, beta3) on target organs. Important exceptions: (1) Sympathetic neurons innervating sweat glands (eccrine) release ACh acting on muscarinic receptors; (2) Sympathetic chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla release epinephrine (80%) and norepinephrine (20%) into the bloodstream. Parasympathetic postganglionic neurons release ACh acting on muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) on target organs. The effects depend on receptor subtype: M3 on smooth muscle causes contraction (bronchi, gut); M2 on heart causes bradycardia; M3 on glands causes secretion. The 'fight-or-flight' (sympathetic) vs. 'rest-and-digest' (parasympathetic) distinction reflects these different neurotransmitter-receptor systems.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Broca's aphasia (expressive/motor/non-fluent aphasia) results from damage to Broca's area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Characteristics: (1) Speech output is non-fluent, effortful, halting, and agrammatic (telegram-style, with loss of function words and grammar but retention of content words). (2) Comprehension is relatively preserved (patients understand spoken and written language reasonably well, especially for simple sentences). (3) Repetition is impaired. (4) Patients are typically aware of their deficit and frustrated. In contrast, Wernicke's aphasia (receptive/sensory/fluent aphasia) from damage to Wernicke's area produces fluent but meaningless speech (word salad, neologisms, paraphasias) with severely impaired comprehension. Conduction aphasia from arcuate fasciculus damage produces fluent speech with good comprehension but impaired repetition. The classic Wernicke-Geschwind model, while oversimplified, remains a useful framework. Modern neuroimaging shows that language involves distributed networks beyond these classical areas.",

        "Climbing fibers carry sensory information for real-time motor control",

        "Climbing fibers inhibit Purkinje cells to increase cerebellar output"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The climbing fiber (CF) system from the inferior olive is unique in neural circuitry: each CF contacts a single Purkinje cell (PC) with ~300-500 synaptic contacts wrapping around the proximal dendrite, creating the most powerful synapse in the brain \u2014 a single CF activation reliably triggers a 'complex spike' (initial Na+ spike followed by Ca2+ dendritic spikes and a burst of spikelets). The Marr-Albus-Ito model proposes that CFs carry error signals: when a movement produces an unexpected outcome, the resulting CF activation provides a teaching signal that induces LTD at simultaneously active parallel fiber (PF) \u2192 PC synapses. LTD weakens the PF synapses that contributed to the erroneous motor command, adjusting the cerebellar output for future movements. This cerebellar LTD requires simultaneous PF activation (via mGluR1/PKC signaling) and CF activation (via dendritic Ca2+ spikes). The result is supervised motor learning: the cerebellum progressively improves motor performance by reducing the discrepancy between intended and actual movements.",

      "explanation": "The ascending arousal system is a collection of parallel, largely redundant neurotransmitter pathways that maintain wakefulness and cortical activation. Key components: (1) Cholinergic: PPT/LDT nuclei in the brainstem activate the thalamus; basal forebrain (nucleus basalis) directly activates the cortex. Active during wake and REM sleep. (2) Noradrenergic: Locus coeruleus (LC) broadly innervates the cortex. Active during wake, reduced in sleep, silent in REM. (3) Serotonergic: Dorsal and median raphe nuclei project widely. Active during wake, reduced in sleep, silent in REM. (4) Dopaminergic: VTA projections to cortex and limbic areas promote wakefulness. (5) Histaminergic: Tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) projects diffusely. Active only during wake (antihistamines cause drowsiness). (6) Orexin/Hypocretin: Lateral hypothalamic neurons stabilize the wake state by exciting all other arousal centers. Loss of orexin neurons causes narcolepsy with cataplexy.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The somatosensory homunculus (mapped by Wilder Penfield using electrical stimulation during surgery in the 1930s-50s) is distorted because cortical representation is proportional to: (1) Receptor density: The fingertips have ~2,500 Meissner's corpuscles per cm\u00b2 and very small receptive fields (~2-3 mm two-point discrimination), providing high spatial resolution. The back has much lower receptor density and larger receptive fields (~40 mm discrimination). (2) Behavioral importance: Regions crucial for fine sensory discrimination (hands for manipulation, lips/tongue for speech and eating, genitalia) receive disproportionately large cortical representation, reflecting the neural resources required for processing. This principle of 'magnification factor' also applies to the visual cortex (the fovea, with highest acuity, is hugely overrepresented) and auditory cortex (frequencies important for speech are overrepresented). Cortical maps are plastic \u2014 amputation causes expansion of adjacent representations into the deprived area, and extensive training (musicians, Braille readers) expands the representation of trained fingers.",

By the time motor symptoms appear, ~60-80% of SNc dopamine neurons have been lost. The pathological hallmark is alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in surviving neurons. Dopamine loss disrupts the balance between basal ganglia pathways: (1) Direct pathway (D1): Normally facilitated by dopamine; becomes underactive \u2192 reduced movement facilitation. (2) Indirect pathway (D2): Normally suppressed by dopamine; becomes overactive \u2192 excessive movement suppression. The net result is increased GPi/SNr output (increased thalamic inhibition), causing bradykinesia (slow movements), rigidity (increased muscle tone), and akinesia (difficulty initiating movements). Treatment with L-DOPA (the dopamine precursor that crosses the BBB) replenishes striatal dopamine. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) reduces indirect pathway overactivity.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Delta waves during deep NREM sleep arise from thalamocortical circuit dynamics. During wakefulness, arousal system neurotransmitters (ACh, NE, 5-HT, histamine) depolarize thalamocortical relay neurons, keeping them in tonic firing mode (faithful relay of sensory information). When arousal systems reduce their activity during sleep onset, thalamic relay neurons become progressively hyperpolarized. At hyperpolarized potentials (-65 to -75 mV), T-type Ca2+ channels (Cav3.1) deinactivate. Subsequent depolarization (from cortical feedback or intrinsic currents) triggers low-threshold Ca2+ spikes that produce burst firing patterns. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), connected to relay neurons by inhibitory GABAergic synapses, creates rhythmic inhibition-rebound cycles that synchronize thalamic bursting. These synchronized thalamic bursts drive large populations of cortical neurons to fire synchronously, producing the high-amplitude, low-frequency EEG patterns characteristic of deep sleep (delta waves at 0.5-4 Hz, spindles at 11-15 Hz). The cortical slow oscillation (<1 Hz) also contributes by alternating between UP states (active) and DOWN states (silent).",

Both tasks should be identical except for the process of interest. For mental arithmetic: Experimental condition: '8 + 5 = ?' (requires numerical processing, addition, comparison). Control condition: 'XXXX' (visual fixation/passive viewing, controlling for visual input, motor response, attention). Better control: present the same digits without arithmetic ('8, 5 = XX', controlling for number perception). Subtracting control from experimental reveals regions specifically engaged in arithmetic (intraparietal sulcus, prefrontal cortex) while removing regions engaged in visual processing, motor planning, etc. Modern fMRI uses block designs, event-related designs, and sophisticated statistical analysis (general linear model, SPM).

Layer II/III — small/medium pyramidal neurons, cortico-cortical projections. Layer IV — stellate cells, receives thalamocortical input (thick in sensory cortices). Layer V — large pyramidal neurons (Betz cells in motor cortex), projects to brainstem/spinal cord. Layer VI — corticothalamic feedback. Statement II is TRUE: Korbinian Brodmann (1909) mapped cortical areas based on cytoarchitecture. Area 4 (precentral gyrus) is primary motor cortex with giant layer V Betz cells. Area 17 (calcarine sulcus) is V1 with thick layer IV (stria of Gennari). Areas 3,1,2 (postcentral gyrus) are primary somatosensory cortex. Areas 44/45 are Broca's area. Statement III is TRUE: Language lateralization to the left hemisphere occurs in >95% of right-handed and ~70% of left-handed individuals. Broca's area damage causes non-fluent/expressive aphasia. Wernicke's area damage causes fluent/receptive aphasia. The arcuate fasciculus connects these areas. Split-brain studies (Sperry, Nobel Prize 1981) demonstrated hemispheric specialization: left hemisphere — language, analytical; right hemisphere — spatial, emotional prosody. Statement IV is FALSE: Cytoarchitectural variation is dramatic. V1 has a unique layer IV with sublayers (4Cα, 4Cβ). Motor cortex is agranular (thin layer IV, thick layer V). This variation is the basis of Brodmann's mapping and reflects different computational demands.",

Humans (EQ 7.4) have brains 7.4× expected — the highest among mammals. Elephants, despite 5000g brains, have EQ of only 1.9 because their body demands proportionally more brain. (2) Neocortex ratio: The proportion of brain occupied by neocortex correlates with social complexity (Dunbar's social brain hypothesis). Humans and dolphins share the highest ratio (0.80). Dunbar predicted human social group size (~150) from neocortex ratio. (3) Social brain hypothesis: The demands of navigating complex social relationships (alliances, deception, cooperation, theory of mind) drove neocortex expansion, particularly prefrontal association areas.

      "options": [
        "All diseases involve the same misfolded protein",
        "Each disease involves a different misfolded protein forming toxic aggregates in selectively vulnerable neurons — Aβ/tau in hippocampus (memory loss), α-synuclein in SNc (motor symptoms), expanded huntingtin in striatum (chorea), TDP-43 in motor neurons (paralysis) — with shared themes of protein quality control failure, prion-like propagation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation",

        "Protein aggregates are protective"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Protein misfolding is the unifying theme: (1) Alzheimer's: β-secretase + γ-secretase cleave APP → Aβ42 aggregates (oligomers most toxic). Tau hyperphosphorylation → NFTs spreading through Braak stages. APOE ε4 impairs Aβ clearance. (2) Parkinson's: α-synuclein misfolding → Lewy bodies. SNc neuron loss → striatal dopamine depletion → motor symptoms. LRRK2 (kinase), Parkin/PINK1 (mitochondrial QC). (3) Huntington's: >36 CAG repeats in HTT → polyQ-expanded huntingtin aggregates. Autosomal dominant, fully penetrant. Striatal D2-MSNs most vulnerable. Anticipation in successive generations. (4) ALS: TDP-43 mislocalizes from nucleus to cytoplasmic aggregates in 97% of cases. C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat expansion → toxic dipeptide repeats + RNA foci. (5) Shared mechanisms: proteasome/autophagy overload, prion-like seeding and spreading through neural circuits, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity.",

      "options": [
        "The visual cortex cannot change after birth",
        "The critical period is a developmental window (approximately postnatal weeks 3-5 in mice, first few years in humans) when visual experience shapes ocular dominance columns — it is opened by maturation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons that establish inhibitory/excitatory balance, and closed by the accumulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-rich ECM structures) around PV+ neurons and myelin-associated inhibitors (Nogo, MAG, OMgp) that restrict structural plasticity",
        "Critical periods last throughout the entire lifespan",
        "Only excitatory neurons determine critical period timing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The critical period for ocular dominance plasticity is a paradigm for understanding experience-dependent brain development: (1) Discovery: Hubel and Wiesel showed that monocular deprivation during a critical period causes permanent shift of ocular dominance — deprived-eye cortical responses weaken, open-eye responses strengthen, causing amblyopia. After the critical period, the same deprivation has no effect. (2) Opening: Maturation of PV+ fast-spiking basket cells creates the inhibitory tone necessary for competitive interactions between eye-specific inputs. GABA circuit maturation is triggered by BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Benzodiazepine treatment (enhancing GABA_A receptors) can precociously open the critical period. GAD65 knockout mice (reduced GABA) fail to open the critical period until GABA is rescued pharmacologically. (3) Closing — molecular brakes: (a) Perineuronal nets (PNNs): Specialized ECM structures (aggrecan, brevican, neurocan, versican) that form a meshwork around PV+ neurons. PNNs physically restrict synaptic remodeling and protect mature circuits from further modification. Enzymatic removal of PNNs (chondroitinase ABC) reopens plasticity in adult cortex. (b) Myelin-associated inhibitors: Nogo receptor ligands (Nogo-A, MAG, OMgp) signal through NgR1/p75NTR/LINGO-1 receptor complex to activate RhoA, collapsing growth cones and preventing axonal sprouting. (c) Lynx1: An endogenous inhibitor of nicotinic ACh receptors; Lynx1 knockout mice show extended plasticity. (4) Reopening adult plasticity: Besides chondroitinase and genetic manipulations, environmental enrichment, fluoxetine (SSRI), and dark rearing can partially reopen plasticity — potential therapeutic approaches for amblyopia treatment beyond the critical period.",

      "options": [
        "Lesion large brain regions and observe memory loss",
        "Use activity-dependent labeling (c-Fos-tTA system) to mark neurons active during fear conditioning with channelrhodopsin, then test whether optogenetic reactivation of those labeled neurons in a neutral context triggers freezing (false memory) — if so, the specific ensemble is sufficient for memory storage",

        "Measure total brain weight changes after learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The engram labeling approach (Tonegawa lab, MIT): (1) Activity-dependent labeling: c-Fos (immediate early gene) promoter drives tTA, which activates TRE-ChR2 in a doxycycline-controlled temporal window. During fear conditioning (off-dox), active hippocampal neurons express ChR2. (2) Reactivation: In neutral context (on-dox, window closed), blue light reactivates only the labeled neurons. Result: mice freeze in the neutral context = false memory, demonstrating sufficiency. (3) Silencing: Labeling with inhibitory opsins and silencing during recall prevents memory retrieval = necessity. (4) Key findings: (a) Engram cells are sparse, distributed ensembles with enhanced connectivity. (b) Silent engrams persist even when natural retrieval fails (amnesia models) — optogenetic reactivation restores memories. (c) False memories can be created by co-activating engrams with new experiences. (d) Systems consolidation shifts engram from hippocampus to cortex over weeks.",

      "options": [
        "The ANS controls only skeletal muscles",
        "The ANS uses a two-neuron chain (preganglionic → ganglionic synapse → postganglionic → effector) with sympathetic (thoracolumbar, NE postganglionic) and parasympathetic (craniosacral, ACh postganglionic) divisions that often have opposing effects on target organs, plus an enteric division (~500 million neurons) capable of autonomous gut function",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ANS two-neuron chain differs from the somatic single-neuron pathway: (1) Sympathetic: T1-L2 preganglionic (short, ACh on nicotinic receptors) → paravertebral/prevertebral ganglia → long postganglionic (NE on adrenergic receptors, except sweat glands = ACh). Adrenal medulla: modified postganglionic cells release epinephrine into blood. Fight-or-flight responses. (2) Parasympathetic: CN III, VII, IX, X + S2-S4 preganglionic (long, ACh/nicotinic) → ganglia near/within target organs → short postganglionic (ACh on muscarinic receptors). Vagus = 75% of parasympathetic fibers. Rest-and-digest. (3) Dual innervation: Most organs receive both sympathetic and parasympathetic input with opposing effects (heart: sympathetic ↑ HR, parasympathetic ↓ HR). (4) Enteric: ~500 million neurons in myenteric (motility) and submucosal (secretion) plexuses. Functions independently if extrinsic nerves severed. 95% of body serotonin in gut. Hirschsprung's disease: absent enteric ganglia from failed neural crest migration.",

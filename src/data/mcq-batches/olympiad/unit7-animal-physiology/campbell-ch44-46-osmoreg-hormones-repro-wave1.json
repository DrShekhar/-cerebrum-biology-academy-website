      "question": "A marine teleost fish maintains plasma osmolarity at approximately 300 mOsm/L in seawater (~1000 mOsm/L). Which combination of mechanisms is correctly matched to this osmoregulatory challenge?",
      "options": [
        "A) The fish drinks seawater continuously, absorbs NaCl and water across the intestinal epithelium, then actively secretes excess NaCl via mitochondria-rich chloride cells in the gills using basolateral Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and apical CFTR Cl⁻ channels",
        "B) The fish avoids drinking seawater, produces copious dilute urine to flush excess salt, and absorbs water osmotically across the gill epithelium",
        "C) The fish accumulates urea and TMAO in its tissues to match seawater osmolarity, similar to the strategy used by chondrichthyans",
        "D) The fish relies exclusively on paracellular NaCl secretion across gill epithelia driven by the transepithelial electrical gradient, with no active transport involvement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Marine teleosts face constant osmotic water loss to their hypertonic environment. They compensate by drinking seawater, absorbing water (along with NaCl) across the intestine, and then actively excreting the excess NaCl through chloride cells (ionocytes) in the gills. These cells use basolateral Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporters (NKCC1) to accumulate Cl⁻ intracellularly, which then exits apically through CFTR channels. Na⁺ follows paracellularly down the electrical gradient. They produce very small volumes of isotonic or slightly hypertonic urine. Option C describes elasmobranchs (sharks/rays), not teleosts. Option B describes freshwater fish strategies. Option D is partially correct about paracellular Na⁺ movement but incorrectly excludes active transport.",

      "question": "In the mammalian nephron, the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water but relatively impermeable to NaCl, while the thin ascending limb is permeable to NaCl but impermeable to water. How does this differential permeability contribute to the countercurrent multiplier system?",
      "options": [
        "A) NaCl is actively pumped out of the thin descending limb, creating a dilute fluid that then absorbs water in the ascending limb",
        "B) Both limbs function identically, and the concentration gradient is established solely by active transport in the thick ascending limb with no contribution from the thin segments",
        "C) Water exits the descending limb into the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium, concentrating the tubular fluid; NaCl then passively diffuses out of the concentrated fluid in the thin ascending limb, diluting it — this passive NaCl efflux is driven by the concentration gradient established by the descending limb",
        "D) Water enters the ascending limb from the interstitium, diluting the tubular fluid, while NaCl is actively secreted into the descending limb"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The countercurrent multiplier depends on a 'single effect' — a small osmotic difference — being multiplied along the length of the loop. Water leaves the descending limb passively (driven by the hyperosmotic interstitium maintained largely by NaCl pumped out of the thick ascending limb). This concentrates NaCl in the descending limb fluid. When this concentrated fluid rounds the hairpin turn into the thin ascending limb (which is water-impermeable), NaCl passively diffuses out down its concentration gradient, contributing to interstitial hypertonicity. The thick ascending limb then actively pumps NaCl (via NKCC2 transporters) to maintain the cortico-medullary gradient. Thus the thin segments contribute passively, while the thick ascending limb provides the active energy input.",

      "question": "ADH (vasopressin) increases water reabsorption in the collecting duct by triggering insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels into the apical membrane. Which intracellular signaling pathway mediates this translocation?",
      "options": [
        "A) ADH binds V1 receptors on the apical membrane → Gαq activation → PLC → IP₃/DAG → Ca²⁺ release → calmodulin-dependent kinase directly opens pre-existing AQP2 channels",
        "B) ADH binds intracellular nuclear receptors → transcription of AQP2 mRNA → de novo synthesis of AQP2 protein → direct insertion into apical membrane within 2 minutes",
        "C) ADH activates receptor tyrosine kinases → Ras-MAPK cascade → phosphorylation of AQP2 C-terminal domain → clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AQP2 from the basolateral membrane and redistribution to the apical surface",
        "D) ADH binds V2 receptors (a GPCR) on the basolateral membrane → Gαs activation → adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → PKA phosphorylates AQP2 at Ser-256 → exocytic fusion of AQP2-containing vesicles with the apical membrane"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "ADH (arginine vasopressin) binds V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the collecting duct. V2 is a Gαs-coupled GPCR that activates adenylyl cyclase, raising intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates AQP2 at serine-256. This phosphorylation triggers the exocytic fusion of intracellular vesicles containing pre-formed AQP2 channels with the apical plasma membrane, increasing water permeability within minutes. V1 receptors are found in vascular smooth muscle (vasoconstriction) and use the Gαq/PLC pathway. Long-term ADH exposure also upregulates AQP2 gene transcription, but the rapid response is vesicle trafficking, not de novo synthesis.",

      "options": [
        "A) Presence of aquaporin channels in the thin ascending limb, allowing bidirectional water and solute flux",
        "B) Exceptionally long loops of Henle that extend deep into the inner medulla, generating a steep cortico-medullary osmotic gradient enhanced by extensive urea recycling via UT-A1 and UT-A3 transporters",

        "D) Replacement of the loop of Henle with a straight collecting duct that passes directly through the renal papilla"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The kangaroo rat and other desert mammals have proportionally very long loops of Henle (especially juxtamedullary nephrons) that penetrate deep into an elongated renal papilla. This creates an extremely steep cortico-medullary osmotic gradient (up to ~6000 mOsm/L at the papilla tip). Urea recycling is critical: ADH stimulates UT-A1 and UT-A3 urea transporters in the inner medullary collecting duct, allowing urea to accumulate in the inner medulla where it contributes approximately 50% of the medullary osmolarity. This urea then passively enters the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, recycling back through the system. The vasa recta (countercurrent exchangers) preserve the gradient. Kangaroo rats also have very low GFR (not high) to minimize water loss.",

      "question": "In the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates TSH release from the anterior pituitary, which in turn stimulates T3/T4 release from the thyroid. A patient presents with elevated TSH but low free T4. Which diagnosis is most consistent?",
      "options": [
        "A) Primary hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland fails to produce adequate T4 despite appropriate TSH stimulation, and negative feedback is lost",

        "C) Tertiary hypothyroidism due to hypothalamic failure to secrete TRH",
        "D) Graves' disease, where thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins mimic TSH action"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Elevated TSH with low free T4 is the hallmark of primary hypothyroidism (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis, iodine deficiency). The thyroid gland itself is failing, so T4 production drops. The loss of negative feedback (normally T4/T3 inhibit TRH and TSH release) causes the anterior pituitary to increase TSH secretion in an attempt to stimulate the failing gland. In secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary failure) or tertiary hypothyroidism (hypothalamic failure), TSH would be low or inappropriately normal. A TSH-secreting adenoma would produce high TSH AND high T4. Graves' disease produces low TSH (suppressed by high T4 from autoimmune stimulation).",

      "options": [
        "A) Both cortisol and epinephrine bind to the same nuclear receptor superfamily but activate different response elements on DNA",
        "B) Epinephrine freely crosses the plasma membrane due to its small molecular size and binds cytoplasmic receptors, while cortisol requires membrane transport proteins to enter the cell",
        "C) Cortisol is a steroid hormone that crosses the plasma membrane, binds intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm, and the hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus to act as a transcription factor; epinephrine is a water-soluble amine that binds cell-surface adrenergic receptors (GPCRs) and triggers rapid second-messenger cascades (cAMP, Ca²⁺)",
        "D) Cortisol acts within seconds via membrane-bound receptors, while epinephrine produces its effects over hours through gene transcription changes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cortisol is a lipophilic steroid derived from cholesterol. It diffuses through the plasma membrane, binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the cytoplasm, causing dissociation of heat-shock proteins (HSP90). The cortisol-GR complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, binding glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) to modulate transcription — effects take hours. Epinephrine is a hydrophilic catecholamine (modified amino acid) that cannot cross membranes. It binds α- and β-adrenergic receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface, activating Gs → adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → PKA (for β-receptors) or Gq → PLC → IP₃/DAG (for α1-receptors), producing effects within seconds to minutes.",

      "question": "During fertilization in sea urchins, the slow block to polyspermy involves the cortical reaction. Which sequence of events correctly describes this mechanism?",
      "options": [
        "A) Sperm contact → immediate depolarization of egg membrane → cortical granules release Ca²⁺ into the perivitelline space → Ca²⁺ hardens the zona pellucida → sperm receptors are destroyed by extracellular proteases",
        "B) Acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase → egg jelly coat dissolves → cortical granules are triggered by mechanical deformation of the egg surface → fertilization envelope forms from polymerized acrosomal proteins",
        "C) Sperm binding to jelly coat → cGMP signaling cascade in egg → exocytosis of cortical granules containing hyaluronic acid → formation of a mucopolysaccharide barrier that physically repels additional sperm",
        "D) Sperm-egg membrane fusion → IP₃-mediated Ca²⁺ wave from ER → cortical granule exocytosis → proteases cleave proteins linking vitelline layer to plasma membrane → water influx raises vitelline layer to form fertilization envelope → ovoperoxidase cross-links the envelope, hardening it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "In sea urchins, the slow block to polyspermy begins when the sperm fuses with the egg plasma membrane, activating phospholipase C (PLC) via a signaling pathway, generating IP₃. IP₃ triggers release of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum, creating a Ca²⁺ wave that propagates across the egg (starting from the point of sperm entry). This Ca²⁺ wave stimulates cortical granules (specialized secretory vesicles beneath the plasma membrane) to undergo exocytosis. The released contents include: (1) proteases that cleave bonds between the vitelline layer and plasma membrane, (2) mucopolysaccharides that draw water osmotically into the perivitelline space (lifting the vitelline layer), and (3) ovoperoxidase that cross-links tyrosine residues to harden the elevated vitelline layer into the fertilization envelope. The fast block is the initial membrane depolarization (Na⁺ influx → +20 mV).",

      "question": "During the human menstrual cycle, the LH surge that triggers ovulation is caused by a switch from negative to positive feedback by estradiol. Which precise conditions trigger this switch?",
      "options": [
        "A) Progesterone levels from the corpus luteum exceed a threshold that sensitizes GnRH neurons to kisspeptin, triggering a massive GnRH pulse",
        "B) Sustained high estradiol levels (>200 pg/mL for approximately 50 hours) from the dominant follicle switch the hypothalamic-pituitary response from inhibition to stimulation, increasing GnRH pulse frequency and sensitizing anterior pituitary gonadotrophs to GnRH",
        "C) Declining inhibin B from granulosa cells removes inhibition of FSH, which then cross-reacts with LH receptors on theca cells",
        "D) A sudden drop in estradiol triggers compensatory rebound secretion of LH from gonadotrophs that had been suppressed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The positive feedback mechanism for the LH surge is concentration- and duration-dependent. During the late follicular phase, the dominant follicle produces rapidly rising estradiol levels. When estradiol exceeds approximately 200 pg/mL and remains elevated for about 50 hours, it switches from suppressing to stimulating LH release. This occurs via multiple mechanisms: (1) increased GnRH pulse frequency from the hypothalamus (mediated by kisspeptin neurons in the AVPV/rostral periventricular area that express ERα), (2) increased sensitivity of anterior pituitary gonadotrophs to GnRH (upregulation of GnRH receptors), and (3) increased pituitary LH synthesis. At lower estradiol concentrations (follicular phase baseline), estradiol exerts negative feedback. This dual feedback is a classic example of concentration-dependent switching.",

      "question": "An insect excretes nitrogenous waste primarily as uric acid via Malpighian tubules. Which statement correctly describes the functional mechanism of Malpighian tubules?",
      "options": [
        "A) Malpighian tubules filter hemolymph under hydrostatic pressure through a basement membrane, similar to glomerular filtration in vertebrates",
        "B) Malpighian tubules are blind-ended tubes that absorb water from the hindgut and secrete it back into the hemolymph, concentrating uric acid in the process",
        "C) Malpighian tubules actively transport K⁺ and urate into the tubule lumen from the hemolymph; water follows osmotically; the fluid then enters the hindgut where water and valuable solutes are reabsorbed, and uric acid precipitates as a semi-solid paste",
        "D) Malpighian tubules use cilia to create a current that draws hemolymph into the tubule lumen, where selective reabsorption of amino acids and glucose occurs before waste is excreted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Malpighian tubules are outpocketings of the gut (at the junction of midgut and hindgut) that float freely in the hemolymph. Unlike vertebrate nephrons, they do not filter under pressure. Instead, active transport of K⁺ (and in some species Na⁺) into the tubule lumen by H⁺/K⁺-ATPases and V-type H⁺-ATPases creates an osmotic gradient that draws water and solutes (including uric acid/urate) into the lumen. This primary urine flows into the hindgut (especially the rectum), where rectal pads or cryptonephric tubules actively reabsorb water, K⁺, and other valuable solutes back into the hemolymph. Uric acid, being relatively insoluble, precipitates and is excreted as a nearly dry paste — a superb water-conservation strategy for terrestrial insects.",

        "C) Vitamin D is a minor contributor to calcium homeostasis, acting only as a cofactor for PTH receptor binding",
        "D) PTH is the principal regulator: it stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (indirectly via RANKL from osteoblasts), increases Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, and promotes 1α-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the proximal tubule to enhance intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "PTH is the dominant calcium-regulating hormone in adult humans. It acts through three main mechanisms: (1) Bone resorption — PTH binds to PTH1R receptors on osteoblasts, stimulating them to produce RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand), which activates osteoclasts to resorb bone and release Ca²⁺; (2) Renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption — PTH increases Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule via TRPV5 channels and calbindin; (3) Vitamin D activation — PTH stimulates 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) in the proximal tubule, converting 25(OH)D to active 1,25(OH)₂D (calcitriol), which increases intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption via TRPV6 and calbindin-D9k.

Ammonia is highly toxic (disrupts membrane potentials, glutamate metabolism), so continuous dilution by water is essential. S2 is TRUE (the statement claims it is FALSE, which is itself incorrect): The urea cycle does occur primarily in the LIVER (not kidney), so the statement's claim is FALSE on that anatomical point — however, the statement as written says 'S2: FALSE' indicating the student should evaluate whether S2 is actually false. The urea cycle occurs in liver hepatocytes, not the kidney, so S2's labeled claim is actually correct — the assertion within S2 is false because urea synthesis occurs in the liver.

Free hormone diffuses into cells and binds nuclear receptor superfamily members (GR, ER, AR, MR, PR). S2 is labeled FALSE and is indeed INCORRECT: Insulin does NOT bind GPCRs — insulin binds the insulin receptor, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Upon insulin binding, the receptor autophosphorylates tyrosine residues, recruits IRS proteins, and activates PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK pathways. The GPCR/cAMP pathway is used by glucagon, not insulin. So S2's label of FALSE is correct. S3 is TRUE: Steroid-receptor complexes bind HREs as dimers and modulate gene expression through chromatin remodeling and coregulator recruitment.

Glucokinase (hexokinase IV) has a high Km (~10 mM) matching the physiological glucose range, acting as the glucose sensor. Increased glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation raises ATP/ADP, closing K_ATP channels (Kir6.2/SUR1), causing membrane depolarization, Ca²⁺ influx through L-type Ca²⁺ channels, and exocytosis. S2 is TRUE: Glucagon signaling in hepatocytes follows the classical Gs-cAMP-PKA cascade. PKA phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase, which then phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase (converting glycogen → glucose-1-phosphate). PKA also phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase. S3 is TRUE: Insulin receptor (RTK) autophosphorylation → IRS → PI3K → PIP3 → PDK1/Akt → AS160 (TBC1D4) phosphorylation → Rab-GTPase activation → GLUT4 vesicle fusion with plasma membrane.

S2 is TRUE: The corpus luteum is an endocrine organ formed from the ruptured follicle. It produces progesterone (~25 mg/day at peak) and estradiol. Progesterone converts the endometrium from proliferative to secretory phase, increases endometrial gland glycogen, and slows GnRH pulse frequency.

AngII normally constricts the efferent arteriole more than the afferent, so blocking AngII preferentially dilates the efferent arteriole. This explains: (1) Increased renal plasma flow (550→620 mL/min) due to reduced renal vascular resistance; (2) Slight GFR decrease (125→115 mL/min) because efferent dilation lowers glomerular capillary pressure; (3) Reduced filtration fraction (22.7→18.5%) = GFR/RPF ratio drops because RPF increased more than GFR. Lower filtration fraction reduces peritubular capillary oncotic pressure, decreasing proximal tubular reabsorption driving force (67→60%). Additionally, reduced AngII means less aldosterone secretion from zona glomerulosa (320→85 pg/mL).

(2) ACTH is elevated (95 pg/mL), ruling out primary adrenal causes (where ACTH would be suppressed by negative feedback). (3) Low-dose dexamethasone fails to suppress cortisol — confirming pathological hypercortisolism (normal HPA axis would suppress). (4) High-dose dexamethasone DOES suppress cortisol — this is characteristic of pituitary adenomas, which retain some feedback sensitivity but require higher glucocorticoid levels. Ectopic ACTH sources (e.g., small-cell lung cancer) typically do NOT suppress with even high-dose dexamethasone. (5) CRH stimulation increases ACTH by 45% — pituitary adenomas typically respond to CRH, while ectopic sources do not. (6) 8 mm pituitary microadenoma on MRI confirms the source.",

The dominant follicle is 22 mm (mature Graafian follicle, typically 18-25 mm at ovulation). The LH surge triggers: (1) resumption and completion of meiosis I in the primary oocyte (producing secondary oocyte + first polar body), (2) luteinization of granulosa and theca cells (initial progesterone rise visible at 1.2 ng/mL), (3) enzymatic weakening of the follicular wall (collagenase, plasmin), and (4) ovulation approximately 36 hours after LH surge onset (Day 14 shows ruptured follicle, progesterone rising to 2.8 ng/mL).

(2) Has clear, measurable endpoints — medullary tissue osmolarity at defined anatomical levels (cortex/outer medulla/inner medulla) and urine osmolarity. (3) Includes proper controls — vehicle control (time-matched, no drug) controls for preparation stability; amiloride control demonstrates that blocking a different sodium transporter (ENaC in collecting duct) does not collapse the medullary gradient, confirming specificity of the furosemide effect to the thick ascending limb. (4) Tests the hypothesis directly — if NKCC2 inhibition abolishes the medullary gradient, it demonstrates that active NaCl transport in the thick ascending limb is necessary for gradient establishment. The predicted result: furosemide → medullary osmolarity falls toward isotonic (~300 mOsm/L at all levels), urine becomes dilute and high-volume (resembling the effect seen clinically with loop diuretics).

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B is the optimal design because it uses the 'clamp and replace' strategy — endogenous GnRH is eliminated with the antagonist, then replaced with precisely controlled exogenous pulses, allowing independent manipulation of two variables: (1) GnRH pulse frequency and (2) estradiol presence. This factorial design directly tests whether the LH surge requires changes in GnRH pulse frequency, estradiol-induced pituitary sensitization, or both. Group 1 isolates the pituitary sensitization mechanism: if estradiol can induce an LH surge with constant GnRH frequency, then estradiol acts directly on gonadotrophs (increasing GnRH receptor expression, enhancing intracellular signaling, upregulating LHβ gene transcription). Group 2 isolates the GnRH frequency mechanism: if increased pulse frequency alone triggers a surge without estradiol, frequency is sufficient. Group 3 tests the combined/synergistic effect. In reality, research has shown that BOTH mechanisms contribute: estradiol increases GnRH receptor density on gonadotrophs (self-priming effect) AND increases GnRH pulse frequency via kisspeptin neurons. The ewe model is particularly valuable because the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system is accessible for direct GnRH measurement. Option A is correlative, not causal. Option D tests pulsatility requirement but not the specific question asked.",

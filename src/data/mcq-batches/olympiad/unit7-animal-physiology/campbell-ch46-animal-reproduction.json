      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Spermatogenesis proceeds through defined stages: (1) Spermatogonial stem cells (type A) undergo mitotic renewal and produce type B spermatogonia. (2) Type B spermatogonia enter meiosis, becoming PRIMARY spermatocytes (diploid, 2n/4C after S-phase DNA replication). (3) Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I (including crossing over during prophase I), producing two SECONDARY spermatocytes (haploid, 1n/2C). (4) Secondary spermatocytes undergo meiosis II, producing four round SPERMATIDS (haploid, 1n/1C). (5) Spermatids undergo spermiogenesis (differentiation, not division) — acrosome formation, flagellum assembly, nuclear condensation (histones replaced by protamines), cytoplasmic shedding — to become mature spermatozoa. Spermatogonia undergo mitosis, not meiosis. Sertoli cells are somatic support cells that never undergo meiosis. The entire process takes approximately 64-74 days in humans.",

      "options": [
        "The egg produces toxic substances that kill all sperm except the first to arrive",
        "The fast block (membrane depolarization within seconds) and slow block (cortical granule exocytosis modifying the zona pellucida within minutes) provide two sequential barriers to additional sperm entry",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Polyspermy prevention in mammals involves two blocks: (1) Fast (electrical) block: In sea urchins, this is well-characterized — sperm-egg fusion causes immediate membrane depolarization (from -70 mV to +20 mV), preventing additional sperm binding. In mammals, the fast block is less clearly established and may be less important. (2) Slow (cortical reaction) block: This is the primary polyspermy block in mammals. Upon sperm-egg fusion, a Ca2+ wave propagates across the egg cortex. Ca2+ triggers exocytosis of cortical granules (membrane-bound vesicles beneath the plasma membrane). Cortical granule enzymes (including ovastacin, a metalloendoprotease) cleave ZP2 protein in the zona pellucida, preventing additional sperm from binding and penetrating ('zona hardening'). Cortical granule contents also modify the plasma membrane. This cortical reaction takes 1-5 minutes. The Ca2+ oscillations triggered by PLCζ (phospholipase C zeta) introduced by the sperm also activate the egg to complete meiosis II.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "(I) TRUE: During the follicular phase (days 1-14), FSH from the anterior pituitary stimulates growth of ovarian follicles. The growing follicles produce increasing amounts of estradiol, which proliferates the endometrium (proliferative phase). (II) TRUE: Mid-cycle, the rising estradiol crosses a threshold (~200 pg/mL for >50 hours) and triggers positive feedback on kisspeptin neurons in the AVPV, causing the GnRH/LH surge. The LH surge activates MMPs and COX-2 in the follicle wall, leading to rupture (ovulation) approximately 36 hours later. The remaining granulosa and theca cells luteinize under LH influence, forming the corpus luteum. (III) TRUE: The corpus luteum secretes high levels of progesterone (and some estrogen), which transforms the endometrium into a secretory state, inhibits GnRH pulse frequency (favoring FSH over LH), and provides negative feedback suppressing the HPG axis. (IV) FALSE: Corpus luteum regression (luteolysis) occurs after ~14 days due to LOSS of LH support (as LH levels decline from progesterone negative feedback) and possibly prostaglandin F2α. In some species, LH (not hCG) maintains the CL early, but the mechanism of luteolysis is complex and involves intrinsic CL programming, not simply lack of FSH.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Multiple converging evidence points to ovulation between days 13-14: (1) LH surge: Day 13 shows LH = 60 mIU/mL (compared to baseline 5-8), a >6× increase. The LH surge is the definitive trigger for ovulation. (2) Follicle collapse: The dominant follicle reaches 22 mm on day 13 (near-ovulatory size, typically 18-24 mm) and is 'collapsed' by day 14, indicating rupture and oocyte release. (3) Progesterone rise: Progesterone begins increasing from day 13 (1.5 → 3.0 → 15.0), confirming luteinization — the granulosa cells of the ruptured follicle are producing progesterone as the corpus luteum forms. (4) Estradiol peak and decline: Estradiol peaks at day 13 (350 pg/mL, from the mature follicle) and drops after ovulation as the follicle transitions to corpus luteum. The standard clinical estimate is ovulation ~36 hours after LH surge onset, placing it late day 13 to early day 14. Day 21 peak progesterone (15 ng/mL) confirms successful ovulation occurred ~7 days earlier.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The acrosome reaction in mammals is a regulated exocytic event: (1) Capacitation: Before the acrosome reaction can occur, sperm must undergo capacitation in the female reproductive tract (6-8 hours in humans). Capacitation involves cholesterol removal from the sperm membrane, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and hyperactivated motility. (2) ZP3 binding: Capacitated sperm bind ZP3 glycoprotein on the zona pellucida via sperm surface receptors. This triggers a signaling cascade involving Gi protein activation, PLCδ, IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, and extracellular Ca2+ influx through CatSper channels (sperm-specific calcium channels). (3) Acrosomal exocytosis: Elevated Ca2+ triggers SNARE-mediated fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane with the sperm plasma membrane, releasing acrosomal enzymes (acrosin — a serine protease, hyaluronidase, and others) that digest a path through the zona pellucida. (4) Inner acrosomal membrane exposure reveals IZUMO1, which binds JUNO on the egg plasma membrane for fusion. CatSper mutations cause male infertility.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Broadcast spawning is the most common reproductive strategy in marine invertebrates and many fish/amphibians. Organisms release enormous numbers of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs externally. Key features: (1) Synchronization: Spawning must be temporally coordinated to maximize fertilization success. Cues include lunar cycles (coral mass spawning on the Great Barrier Reef occurs after the full moon in spring), water temperature, day length, and species-specific pheromones (spawning-inducing substances, SIS). (2) High gamete production: Because dilution and predation in the water column cause massive gamete loss, broadcast spawners produce enormous quantities — a single female sea urchin may release millions of eggs. (3) Species recognition: Bindin proteins on the sperm acrosome surface bind species-specific receptors on the egg vitelline envelope, preventing hybridization. (4) Low parental investment per offspring but high fecundity. This contrasts with internal fertilization strategies that typically involve fewer, more heavily invested offspring.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Comprehensive phenotyping of a Sertoli cell-specific knockout requires multi-level analysis: (1) Gross anatomy: Testis weight (reduced if spermatogenesis fails — spermatogenic cells constitute ~75% of testicular volume). (2) Histology: H&E staining of seminiferous tubule cross-sections to identify the stage at which spermatogenesis arrests (e.g., spermatogonial arrest vs. meiotic arrest vs. spermiogenic defect). Immunostaining for specific germ cell markers (PLZF for spermatogonia, SCP3 for meiotic cells, CREM for spermatids) pinpoints the defect. (3) Sperm analysis: Epididymal sperm count, motility assessment, and morphological analysis (WHO criteria). (4) Fertility: Mating trials with proven fertile females measuring pregnancy rate, litter size, and implantation sites. (5) Hormones: FSH (elevated if Sertoli cell function is impaired — loss of inhibin B feedback), LH, testosterone (from Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells — option D is wrong), and inhibin B (Sertoli cell marker).

      "explanation": "hCG is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the implanting blastocyst/developing placenta. Its primary function is 'rescue' of the corpus luteum: (1) Without pregnancy, the corpus luteum degenerates by day 28, causing progesterone withdrawal and menstruation. (2) The implanting embryo (~day 6-7) begins producing hCG, which enters the maternal circulation. (3) hCG is structurally similar to LH (sharing the same α-subunit and a homologous β-subunit) and binds the LH/CG receptor (LHCGR) on corpus luteum cells. (4) This maintains the corpus luteum, sustaining progesterone production essential for endometrial support and pregnancy maintenance. (5) hCG peaks at ~10 weeks gestation, after which the placenta itself produces sufficient progesterone (luteal-placental shift), and the corpus luteum is no longer required. hCG is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests (both urine and blood β-hCG assays). It doubles approximately every 48 hours in early viable pregnancies.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is formed by tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubule. It divides the seminiferous epithelium into two compartments: (1) Basal compartment: Contains spermatogonia and early primary spermatocytes. Accessible to immune cells and blood-borne molecules. (2) Adluminal compartment: Contains primary spermatocytes (from leptotene onward), secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids. Immunologically privileged. The critical function is immune protection: Spermatogenesis begins at puberty, long after immune tolerance is established. Post-meiotic germ cells express novel haploid-specific surface antigens that the immune system has never encountered. Without the BTB, these would be recognized as 'foreign' and attacked (autoimmune orchitis). Sertoli cells also actively create an immunosuppressive environment by secreting immunosuppressive factors. The BTB dynamically opens and closes to allow preleptotene spermatocytes to transit from basal to adluminal compartment.",

Since larger females produce more eggs, switching to female when large maximizes reproductive output. Conversely, some wrasses are protogynous (female-to-male), because large dominant males monopolize mating. (II) TRUE: Obligate parthenogenesis occurs in some whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis), water fleas (Daphnia — cyclical parthenogenesis), aphids (summer generations), and komodo dragons. Most parthenogenetic offspring are genetic clones (apomixis) or near-clones (automixis with fusion of meiotic products). (III) TRUE: Traumatic (or extragenital) insemination in Cimex lectularius involves the male using a hypodermic aedeagus to pierce the female's abdomen, depositing sperm into the hemocoel. Sperm migrate through the hemolymph to the ovaries. (IV) FALSE: Monotremes (platypus, echidna) are egg-laying mammals (oviparity with internal fertilization).

(2) Bicarbonate activation: HCO3- enters sperm, activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), increasing cAMP, which activates PKA. (3) PKA-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation: Widespread tyrosine phosphorylation events (mediated by Src-family kinases) remodel sperm signaling. (4) pH changes: Intracellular pH rises (via NHE and sNHE), contributing to CatSper channel activation. (5) Ca2+ influx: Elevated Ca2+ through CatSper channels in the principal piece of the flagellum.

Progesterone is essential for endometrial maintenance, myometrial quiescence, and immune tolerance. Loss of the CL before week 8 causes miscarriage. (2) Weeks 8-12: The placenta (specifically, the syncytiotrophoblast) progressively takes over progesterone production. The placenta converts maternal cholesterol to pregnenolone and then progesterone using CYP11A1 and 3β-HSD. (3) After week 10-12: The placenta produces sufficient progesterone independently, and the corpus luteum is no longer essential. This is confirmed clinically: luteectomy (CL removal) before 7 weeks causes miscarriage, but after 10 weeks, pregnancy continues normally. The data show hCG peaks at ~8 weeks then declines (less CL stimulation needed), while progesterone continues rising (placental production increasing). The massive rise in estrogen reflects placental estrogen production (requiring fetal adrenal DHEAS as a precursor — the feto-placental unit).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "COCPs work through multiple complementary mechanisms: (1) PRIMARY — Ovulation suppression: The continuous exogenous estrogen and progestin provide constant negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the mid-cycle LH surge needed for ovulation. Without the LH surge, the dominant follicle does not rupture. The progestin component is most critical for ovulation suppression (it suppresses GnRH pulse frequency), while the estrogen stabilizes the endometrium and suppresses FSH (preventing follicular recruitment). (2) Cervical mucus: Progestin thickens cervical mucus, creating a barrier to sperm penetration (the mucus becomes scanty, viscous, and hostile to sperm — low spinnbarkeit). (3) Endometrial effects: The endometrium becomes thin and atrophic, potentially reducing receptivity to implantation if ovulation and fertilization occur (breakthrough). (4) Tubal motility: May alter fallopian tube motility. The combination of these mechanisms gives COCPs >99% effectiveness with perfect use.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The two-cell model reflects the complementary enzyme expression in ovarian follicular cells: (1) THECA CELLS (theca interna): Express LH receptors. LH activates steroidogenesis (via cAMP/PKA/StAR), producing androgens — primarily androstenedione (and some testosterone) from cholesterol. However, theca cells LACK aromatase (CYP19A1) and cannot convert androgens to estrogens. (2) GRANULOSA CELLS: Express FSH receptors. FSH induces aromatase (CYP19A1) expression. Granulosa cells take up androstenedione from adjacent theca cells and aromatize it to estrone, which is then converted to estradiol (the most potent estrogen) by 17β-HSD. Granulosa cells LACK CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase) and cannot produce androgens from pregnenolone/progesterone. Thus, BOTH cell types and BOTH gonadotropins are required for estrogen production. This model explains why: (a) LH alone produces only androgens (polycystic ovary syndrome phenotype with excess LH), and (b) FSH alone without theca-derived androgen substrate cannot produce estrogen.",

The microfluidic approach is ideal: (1) Create a stable, measurable progesterone gradient in a microfluidic chamber. (2) Introduce capacitated sperm and quantify directional bias (chemotactic index = % of sperm swimming toward higher concentration vs. expected 50% by chance). (3) Controls: (a) No gradient (uniform concentration) — sperm should show random movement. (b) Mifepristone (progesterone receptor antagonist) — if chemotaxis is PR-mediated, it should be blocked. However, recent evidence shows sperm progesterone response is NOT through classical nuclear PR but through a non-genomic pathway: progesterone inhibits ABHD2 (α/β-hydrolase domain containing protein 2), which normally degrades 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endocannabinoid that inhibits CatSper. Progesterone → ABHD2 inhibition → 2-AG accumulation blocked → CatSper activation → Ca2+ influx → chemotaxis. CatSper knockout sperm should lack the chemotactic response.",

      "explanation": "Embryonic diapause (delayed implantation) in marsupials like kangaroos is a remarkable reproductive strategy. In the typical scenario: (1) A female kangaroo mates shortly after giving birth. The resulting embryo develops to the blastocyst stage and then enters diapause — developmental arrest at ~80-100 cells. (2) The arrest is maintained by the lactational inhibition of the corpus luteum: the suckling stimulus from the pouch young triggers prolactin release, which inhibits corpus luteum progesterone production and/or directly inhibits embryonic development. (3) When the pouch young is weaned, lost, or removed, the suckling inhibition ceases, prolactin falls, the corpus luteum reactivates, progesterone rises, and the dormant blastocyst resumes development and implants. This allows kangaroos to have three offspring at different stages simultaneously: a fetus in utero, a young joey in the pouch, and an older joey at foot. Embryonic diapause also occurs in some placental mammals (bears, mustelids, armadillos) but with different mechanisms.",

(2) Pattern Ib (some lizards): Higher temperatures → males; lower temperatures → females. (3) Pattern II (crocodilians, some turtles): Intermediate temperatures → males; both extremes → females. The molecular mechanism involves temperature-sensitive expression of key sex-determining genes during the thermosensitive period (TSP, typically the middle third of development). Aromatase (CYP19A1, which converts androgens to estrogens) is temperature-sensitive — at female-producing temperatures, aromatase expression increases, producing estrogen that drives ovarian differentiation.

This arrest can last decades — from fetal life until the oocyte is recruited into a growing follicle. (II) TRUE: The LH surge triggers resumption of meiosis I in the preovulatory follicle. This is mediated by LH-induced EGFR ligand release from mural granulosa cells, which breaks the cGMP supply to the oocyte (via gap junctions), allowing PDE3A to degrade cAMP. Meiosis I completion produces a large secondary oocyte (retaining most cytoplasm) and a small first polar body. (III) TRUE: The secondary oocyte immediately enters meiosis II but arrests at metaphase II (maintained by CSF — cytostatic factor, including Emi2).

(2) Gs activation stimulates adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → PKA activation. (3) ACUTE regulation (minutes): PKA phosphorylates and activates StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), which transports cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane — the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. Without StAR, cholesterol cannot access CYP11A1 (P450scc) in the inner membrane. StAR mutations cause lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia. (4) CHRONIC regulation (hours-days): PKA activates CREB, which induces transcription of steroidogenic enzymes: CYP11A1, CYP17A1, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD.

      "explanation": "The semen analysis reveals severe oligozoospermia (2 million/mL, far below the 15 million/mL reference). The key diagnostic clue is the elevated FSH (25 mIU/mL, ~2× upper normal) with normal testosterone (450 ng/dL). This pattern indicates: (1) PRIMARY spermatogenic failure: The seminiferous tubules are failing to produce sperm normally. Possible causes include genetic factors (Y-chromosome microdeletions, Klinefelter syndrome), varicocele, cryptorchidism, or idiopathic. (2) Elevated FSH: Sertoli cells normally produce inhibin B, which provides negative feedback to the anterior pituitary, suppressing FSH. When spermatogenesis fails, Sertoli cell inhibin B production decreases, removing negative feedback and allowing FSH to rise. High FSH is a marker of testicular germ cell damage. (3) Normal testosterone: Leydig cell function (testosterone production) is controlled by LH and is typically preserved in primary spermatogenic failure because the Leydig cell compartment is often intact. In obstructive azoospermia, FSH would be normal (spermatogenesis is occurring but sperm cannot exit). In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, BOTH FSH and testosterone would be low.",

Paternally expressed imprinted genes (IGF2, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1) tend to promote fetal and placental growth.

      "explanation": "Preeclampsia (affecting 3-5% of pregnancies) is a two-stage disease: (1) STAGE 1 — Placental stage (preclinical): Normally, extravillous trophoblast cells invade the uterine spiral arteries, replacing the muscular walls with fibrinoid material. This converts narrow, high-resistance arteries into wide, low-resistance vessels, ensuring adequate placental blood flow. In preeclampsia, this trophoblast invasion is shallow and incomplete. The spiral arteries remain narrow and responsive to vasoconstrictors, leading to intermittent placental ischemia-reperfusion injury. (2) STAGE 2 — Maternal stage (clinical): The hypoxic, stressed placenta releases anti-angiogenic factors into the maternal circulation: sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, which sequesters VEGF and PlGF) and sEng (soluble endoglin). The resulting imbalance between pro-angiogenic (VEGF, PlGF) and anti-angiogenic (sFlt-1, sEng) factors causes widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, manifesting as hypertension (vasoconstriction), proteinuria (glomerular endotheliosis), and potentially HELLP syndrome, eclampsia (seizures), and organ damage. Delivery of the placenta is the only definitive cure.",

      "options": [
        "Follicle size has no effect on oocyte quality",

      "explanation": "The data show a clear positive correlation between follicle diameter and all developmental endpoints: cleavage (70→85%), blastocyst formation (10→50%), and pregnancy rate (15→55%). This reflects the concept of oocyte developmental competence — the accumulated capacity of the oocyte to support early embryonic development. As follicles grow, the oocyte undergoes: (1) Cytoplasmic maturation: Accumulation of maternal mRNAs (stored in P-bodies and ribonucleoprotein particles), proteins, ribosomes, mitochondria (increased from ~10,000 to ~100,000-300,000), cortical granules, and metabolic substrates. (2) Nuclear maturation: Acquisition of the ability to resume meiosis and form a proper metaphase II spindle. (3) Epigenetic programming: DNA methylation patterns are established during oocyte growth, including imprinting. (4) Organelle distribution: Mitochondria, ER, and Golgi redistribute appropriately. Oocytes from small follicles can be fertilized and cleave (nuclear maturation occurs) but lack sufficient cytoplasmic reserves to support development to the blastocyst stage and beyond, when embryonic genome activation occurs (8-16 cell stage in cattle).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Sexual selection, described by Darwin, operates through two mechanisms: (1) Intrasexual selection (same-sex competition): Members of one sex (typically males) compete directly for mating opportunities. This favors traits that increase competitive ability: antlers in deer (used in male-male combat), large body size in elephant seals (males fight for harem access), horns in beetles, and territorial aggression. The sex with higher variance in reproductive success (usually males) experiences stronger intrasexual selection. (2) Intersexual selection (mate choice): Members of one sex (typically females) choose mates based on specific traits. This favors ornaments and displays: peacock tail feathers, bird-of-paradise dances, frog calls, bowerbird bower construction. Female choice may be based on: (a) direct benefits (territory quality, nuptial gifts, parental care ability), (b) indirect genetic benefits (good genes — the handicap principle proposed by Zahavi, where costly ornaments honestly signal genetic quality), or (c) Fisher's runaway selection (arbitrary preference genes become linked to preferred trait genes).

      "explanation": "Fetal-maternal immunological tolerance is an active, multi-layered process: (1) Non-classical MHC expression: The syncytiotrophoblast (in direct contact with maternal blood) expresses NO MHC class I or II molecules. The extravillous trophoblast expresses non-classical HLA-G and HLA-E, which bind inhibitory receptors (KIR2DL4, CD94/NKG2A) on decidual NK cells, preventing cytotoxicity. Classical HLA-A and HLA-B are specifically ABSENT from trophoblast. (2) Regulatory T cells: Decidual Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) are expanded during pregnancy and actively suppress anti-fetal immune responses. They are induced by paternal antigens and seminal fluid factors. Treg depletion causes miscarriage in mice. (3) Cytokine shift: The decidual microenvironment favors Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β) over Th1-type (IFN-γ, TNF-α), though the situation is more nuanced than a simple Th1/Th2 shift. (4) IDO expression: Trophoblast cells express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which depletes tryptophan, inhibiting T cell proliferation.

(2) F1: The fetus, which is directly exposed in utero to the EDC. Any effects on F1 could be due to DIRECT exposure of the developing fetus, not epigenetic inheritance. (3) F2: The germline (primordial germ cells) of the F1 fetus is also present during the F0 exposure period. Therefore, F2 offspring derive from exposed germ cells — still potentially a direct exposure effect. (4) F3: The first generation whose germline was NEVER directly exposed to the EDC. Effects persisting in F3 must be transmitted through epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications, ncRNAs) in the germline that survive reprogramming. The critical exposure window (E8-E14 in rats) targets the period of gonadal sex determination and epigenetic reprogramming.

Instead, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosome sets determines sex. (2) X:A = 1.0 (XX:AA, normal female): X-linked numerator elements (SisA, SisB/Scute) exceed the autosomal denominator threshold, activating Sex-lethal (Sxl) transcription from the early (Pe) promoter. Sxl protein is an RNA-binding protein that auto-regulates its own splicing (maintaining female-specific Sxl expression) and regulates downstream genes. (3) Splicing cascade: Active Sxl → splices transformer (tra) pre-mRNA in female-specific mode → active Tra protein (with Tra2) → splices doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA in female-specific mode → DsxF activates female differentiation genes.

(2) Pelvic ligament relaxation: It loosens the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints, allowing pelvic expansion during birth (most prominent in guinea pigs and rodents). (3) Myometrial quiescence: During most of pregnancy, relaxin inhibits uterine smooth muscle contractions by promoting NO synthesis and opposing oxytocin. Near term, its effect is overcome by the rising oxytocin/prostaglandin levels. (4) Mammary gland development: Synergizes with prolactin and other hormones. (5) Sources: Corpus luteum (primary source in first trimester), decidualized endometrium, placenta. (6) Additional effects: Increases renal blood flow and GFR during pregnancy, promotes angiogenesis.

During spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins (TP1, TP2), then by protamines (P1 and P2 in humans). Protamines are small (~50 amino acids), highly basic proteins (~70% arginine residues) that neutralize the negative charge of DNA phosphate backbone. (2) Toroidal packaging: Protamine-DNA complexes form toroidal (doughnut-shaped) structures containing ~50 kb of DNA each, linked by protamine-free linker regions. This compacts the chromatin to approximately 1/6th the volume of a somatic cell nucleus. (3) Disulfide cross-linking: Inter- and intra-molecular disulfide bonds between protamine cysteine residues further stabilize the compact structure.

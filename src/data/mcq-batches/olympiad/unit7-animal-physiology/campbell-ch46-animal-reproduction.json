      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Spermatogenesis proceeds through defined stages: (1) Spermatogonial stem cells (type A) undergo mitotic renewal and produce type B spermatogonia. (2) Type B spermatogonia enter meiosis, becoming PRIMARY spermatocytes (diploid, 2n/4C after S-phase DNA replication). (3) Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I (including crossing over during prophase I), producing two SECONDARY spermatocytes (haploid, 1n/2C). (4) Secondary spermatocytes undergo meiosis II, producing four round SPERMATIDS (haploid, 1n/1C). (5) Spermatids undergo spermiogenesis (differentiation, not division) — acrosome formation, flagellum assembly, nuclear condensation (histones replaced by protamines), cytoplasmic shedding — to become mature spermatozoa. Spermatogonia undergo mitosis, not meiosis. Sertoli cells are somatic support cells that never undergo meiosis. The entire process takes approximately 64-74 days in humans.",

      "options": [
        "The egg produces toxic substances that kill all sperm except the first to arrive",
        "The fast block (membrane depolarization within seconds) and slow block (cortical granule exocytosis modifying the zona pellucida within minutes) provide two sequential barriers to additional sperm entry",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Polyspermy prevention in mammals involves two blocks: (1) Fast (electrical) block: In sea urchins, this is well-characterized — sperm-egg fusion causes immediate membrane depolarization (from -70 mV to +20 mV), preventing additional sperm binding. In mammals, the fast block is less clearly established and may be less important. (2) Slow (cortical reaction) block: This is the primary polyspermy block in mammals. Upon sperm-egg fusion, a Ca2+ wave propagates across the egg cortex. Ca2+ triggers exocytosis of cortical granules (membrane-bound vesicles beneath the plasma membrane). Cortical granule enzymes (including ovastacin, a metalloendoprotease) cleave ZP2 protein in the zona pellucida, preventing additional sperm from binding and penetrating ('zona hardening'). Cortical granule contents also modify the plasma membrane. This cortical reaction takes 1-5 minutes. The Ca2+ oscillations triggered by PLCζ (phospholipase C zeta) introduced by the sperm also activate the egg to complete meiosis II.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "(I) TRUE: During the follicular phase (days 1-14), FSH from the anterior pituitary stimulates growth of ovarian follicles. The growing follicles produce increasing amounts of estradiol, which proliferates the endometrium (proliferative phase). (II) TRUE: Mid-cycle, the rising estradiol crosses a threshold (~200 pg/mL for >50 hours) and triggers positive feedback on kisspeptin neurons in the AVPV, causing the GnRH/LH surge. The LH surge activates MMPs and COX-2 in the follicle wall, leading to rupture (ovulation) approximately 36 hours later. The remaining granulosa and theca cells luteinize under LH influence, forming the corpus luteum. (III) TRUE: The corpus luteum secretes high levels of progesterone (and some estrogen), which transforms the endometrium into a secretory state, inhibits GnRH pulse frequency (favoring FSH over LH), and provides negative feedback suppressing the HPG axis. (IV) FALSE: Corpus luteum regression (luteolysis) occurs after ~14 days due to LOSS of LH support (as LH levels decline from progesterone negative feedback) and possibly prostaglandin F2α. In some species, LH (not hCG) maintains the CL early, but the mechanism of luteolysis is complex and involves intrinsic CL programming, not simply lack of FSH.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Multiple converging evidence points to ovulation between days 13-14: (1) LH surge: Day 13 shows LH = 60 mIU/mL (compared to baseline 5-8), a >6× increase. The LH surge is the definitive trigger for ovulation. (2) Follicle collapse: The dominant follicle reaches 22 mm on day 13 (near-ovulatory size, typically 18-24 mm) and is 'collapsed' by day 14, indicating rupture and oocyte release. (3) Progesterone rise: Progesterone begins increasing from day 13 (1.5 → 3.0 → 15.0), confirming luteinization — the granulosa cells of the ruptured follicle are producing progesterone as the corpus luteum forms. (4) Estradiol peak and decline: Estradiol peaks at day 13 (350 pg/mL, from the mature follicle) and drops after ovulation as the follicle transitions to corpus luteum. The standard clinical estimate is ovulation ~36 hours after LH surge onset, placing it late day 13 to early day 14. Day 21 peak progesterone (15 ng/mL) confirms successful ovulation occurred ~7 days earlier.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The acrosome reaction in mammals is a regulated exocytic event: (1) Capacitation: Before the acrosome reaction can occur, sperm must undergo capacitation in the female reproductive tract (6-8 hours in humans). Capacitation involves cholesterol removal from the sperm membrane, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and hyperactivated motility. (2) ZP3 binding: Capacitated sperm bind ZP3 glycoprotein on the zona pellucida via sperm surface receptors. This triggers a signaling cascade involving Gi protein activation, PLCδ, IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, and extracellular Ca2+ influx through CatSper channels (sperm-specific calcium channels). (3) Acrosomal exocytosis: Elevated Ca2+ triggers SNARE-mediated fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane with the sperm plasma membrane, releasing acrosomal enzymes (acrosin — a serine protease, hyaluronidase, and others) that digest a path through the zona pellucida. (4) Inner acrosomal membrane exposure reveals IZUMO1, which binds JUNO on the egg plasma membrane for fusion. CatSper mutations cause male infertility.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Broadcast spawning is the most common reproductive strategy in marine invertebrates and many fish/amphibians. Organisms release enormous numbers of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs externally. Key features: (1) Synchronization: Spawning must be temporally coordinated to maximize fertilization success. Cues include lunar cycles (coral mass spawning on the Great Barrier Reef occurs after the full moon in spring), water temperature, day length, and species-specific pheromones (spawning-inducing substances, SIS). (2) High gamete production: Because dilution and predation in the water column cause massive gamete loss, broadcast spawners produce enormous quantities — a single female sea urchin may release millions of eggs. (3) Species recognition: Bindin proteins on the sperm acrosome surface bind species-specific receptors on the egg vitelline envelope, preventing hybridization. (4) Low parental investment per offspring but high fecundity. This contrasts with internal fertilization strategies that typically involve fewer, more heavily invested offspring.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Comprehensive phenotyping of a Sertoli cell-specific knockout requires multi-level analysis: (1) Gross anatomy: Testis weight (reduced if spermatogenesis fails — spermatogenic cells constitute ~75% of testicular volume). (2) Histology: H&E staining of seminiferous tubule cross-sections to identify the stage at which spermatogenesis arrests (e.g., spermatogonial arrest vs. meiotic arrest vs. spermiogenic defect). Immunostaining for specific germ cell markers (PLZF for spermatogonia, SCP3 for meiotic cells, CREM for spermatids) pinpoints the defect. (3) Sperm analysis: Epididymal sperm count, motility assessment, and morphological analysis (WHO criteria). (4) Fertility: Mating trials with proven fertile females measuring pregnancy rate, litter size, and implantation sites. (5) Hormones: FSH (elevated if Sertoli cell function is impaired — loss of inhibin B feedback), LH, testosterone (from Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells — option D is wrong), and inhibin B (Sertoli cell marker).

      "explanation": "hCG is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the implanting blastocyst/developing placenta. Its primary function is 'rescue' of the corpus luteum: (1) Without pregnancy, the corpus luteum degenerates by day 28, causing progesterone withdrawal and menstruation. (2) The implanting embryo (~day 6-7) begins producing hCG, which enters the maternal circulation. (3) hCG is structurally similar to LH (sharing the same α-subunit and a homologous β-subunit) and binds the LH/CG receptor (LHCGR) on corpus luteum cells. (4) This maintains the corpus luteum, sustaining progesterone production essential for endometrial support and pregnancy maintenance. (5) hCG peaks at ~10 weeks gestation, after which the placenta itself produces sufficient progesterone (luteal-placental shift), and the corpus luteum is no longer required. hCG is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests (both urine and blood β-hCG assays). It doubles approximately every 48 hours in early viable pregnancies.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The blood-testis barrier (BTB) is formed by tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubule. It divides the seminiferous epithelium into two compartments: (1) Basal compartment: Contains spermatogonia and early primary spermatocytes. Accessible to immune cells and blood-borne molecules. (2) Adluminal compartment: Contains primary spermatocytes (from leptotene onward), secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids. Immunologically privileged. The critical function is immune protection: Spermatogenesis begins at puberty, long after immune tolerance is established. Post-meiotic germ cells express novel haploid-specific surface antigens that the immune system has never encountered. Without the BTB, these would be recognized as 'foreign' and attacked (autoimmune orchitis). Sertoli cells also actively create an immunosuppressive environment by secreting immunosuppressive factors. The BTB dynamically opens and closes to allow preleptotene spermatocytes to transit from basal to adluminal compartment.",

Since larger females produce more eggs, switching to female when large maximizes reproductive output. Conversely, some wrasses are protogynous (female-to-male), because large dominant males monopolize mating. (II) TRUE: Obligate parthenogenesis occurs in some whiptail lizards (Aspidoscelis), water fleas (Daphnia — cyclical parthenogenesis), aphids (summer generations), and komodo dragons. Most parthenogenetic offspring are genetic clones (apomixis) or near-clones (automixis with fusion of meiotic products). (III) TRUE: Traumatic (or extragenital) insemination in Cimex lectularius involves the male using a hypodermic aedeagus to pierce the female's abdomen, depositing sperm into the hemocoel. Sperm migrate through the hemolymph to the ovaries. (IV) FALSE: Monotremes (platypus, echidna) are egg-laying mammals (oviparity with internal fertilization).

(2) Bicarbonate activation: HCO3- enters sperm, activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), increasing cAMP, which activates PKA. (3) PKA-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation: Widespread tyrosine phosphorylation events (mediated by Src-family kinases) remodel sperm signaling. (4) pH changes: Intracellular pH rises (via NHE and sNHE), contributing to CatSper channel activation. (5) Ca2+ influx: Elevated Ca2+ through CatSper channels in the principal piece of the flagellum.

Progesterone is essential for endometrial maintenance, myometrial quiescence, and immune tolerance. Loss of the CL before week 8 causes miscarriage. (2) Weeks 8-12: The placenta (specifically, the syncytiotrophoblast) progressively takes over progesterone production. The placenta converts maternal cholesterol to pregnenolone and then progesterone using CYP11A1 and 3β-HSD. (3) After week 10-12: The placenta produces sufficient progesterone independently, and the corpus luteum is no longer essential. This is confirmed clinically: luteectomy (CL removal) before 7 weeks causes miscarriage, but after 10 weeks, pregnancy continues normally. The data show hCG peaks at ~8 weeks then declines (less CL stimulation needed), while progesterone continues rising (placental production increasing). The massive rise in estrogen reflects placental estrogen production (requiring fetal adrenal DHEAS as a precursor — the feto-placental unit).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "COCPs work through multiple complementary mechanisms: (1) PRIMARY — Ovulation suppression: The continuous exogenous estrogen and progestin provide constant negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the mid-cycle LH surge needed for ovulation. Without the LH surge, the dominant follicle does not rupture. The progestin component is most critical for ovulation suppression (it suppresses GnRH pulse frequency), while the estrogen stabilizes the endometrium and suppresses FSH (preventing follicular recruitment). (2) Cervical mucus: Progestin thickens cervical mucus, creating a barrier to sperm penetration (the mucus becomes scanty, viscous, and hostile to sperm — low spinnbarkeit). (3) Endometrial effects: The endometrium becomes thin and atrophic, potentially reducing receptivity to implantation if ovulation and fertilization occur (breakthrough). (4) Tubal motility: May alter fallopian tube motility. The combination of these mechanisms gives COCPs >99% effectiveness with perfect use.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The two-cell model reflects the complementary enzyme expression in ovarian follicular cells: (1) THECA CELLS (theca interna): Express LH receptors. LH activates steroidogenesis (via cAMP/PKA/StAR), producing androgens — primarily androstenedione (and some testosterone) from cholesterol. However, theca cells LACK aromatase (CYP19A1) and cannot convert androgens to estrogens. (2) GRANULOSA CELLS: Express FSH receptors. FSH induces aromatase (CYP19A1) expression. Granulosa cells take up androstenedione from adjacent theca cells and aromatize it to estrone, which is then converted to estradiol (the most potent estrogen) by 17β-HSD. Granulosa cells LACK CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase) and cannot produce androgens from pregnenolone/progesterone. Thus, BOTH cell types and BOTH gonadotropins are required for estrogen production. This model explains why: (a) LH alone produces only androgens (polycystic ovary syndrome phenotype with excess LH), and (b) FSH alone without theca-derived androgen substrate cannot produce estrogen.",

The microfluidic approach is ideal: (1) Create a stable, measurable progesterone gradient in a microfluidic chamber. (2) Introduce capacitated sperm and quantify directional bias (chemotactic index = % of sperm swimming toward higher concentration vs. expected 50% by chance). (3) Controls: (a) No gradient (uniform concentration) — sperm should show random movement. (b) Mifepristone (progesterone receptor antagonist) — if chemotaxis is PR-mediated, it should be blocked. However, recent evidence shows sperm progesterone response is NOT through classical nuclear PR but through a non-genomic pathway: progesterone inhibits ABHD2 (α/β-hydrolase domain containing protein 2), which normally degrades 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endocannabinoid that inhibits CatSper. Progesterone → ABHD2 inhibition → 2-AG accumulation blocked → CatSper activation → Ca2+ influx → chemotaxis. CatSper knockout sperm should lack the chemotactic response.",

      "explanation": "Embryonic diapause (delayed implantation) in marsupials like kangaroos is a remarkable reproductive strategy. In the typical scenario: (1) A female kangaroo mates shortly after giving birth. The resulting embryo develops to the blastocyst stage and then enters diapause — developmental arrest at ~80-100 cells. (2) The arrest is maintained by the lactational inhibition of the corpus luteum: the suckling stimulus from the pouch young triggers prolactin release, which inhibits corpus luteum progesterone production and/or directly inhibits embryonic development. (3) When the pouch young is weaned, lost, or removed, the suckling inhibition ceases, prolactin falls, the corpus luteum reactivates, progesterone rises, and the dormant blastocyst resumes development and implants. This allows kangaroos to have three offspring at different stages simultaneously: a fetus in utero, a young joey in the pouch, and an older joey at foot. Embryonic diapause also occurs in some placental mammals (bears, mustelids, armadillos) but with different mechanisms.",

(2) Pattern Ib (some lizards): Higher temperatures → males; lower temperatures → females. (3) Pattern II (crocodilians, some turtles): Intermediate temperatures → males; both extremes → females. The molecular mechanism involves temperature-sensitive expression of key sex-determining genes during the thermosensitive period (TSP, typically the middle third of development). Aromatase (CYP19A1, which converts androgens to estrogens) is temperature-sensitive — at female-producing temperatures, aromatase expression increases, producing estrogen that drives ovarian differentiation.

This arrest can last decades — from fetal life until the oocyte is recruited into a growing follicle. (II) TRUE: The LH surge triggers resumption of meiosis I in the preovulatory follicle. This is mediated by LH-induced EGFR ligand release from mural granulosa cells, which breaks the cGMP supply to the oocyte (via gap junctions), allowing PDE3A to degrade cAMP. Meiosis I completion produces a large secondary oocyte (retaining most cytoplasm) and a small first polar body. (III) TRUE: The secondary oocyte immediately enters meiosis II but arrests at metaphase II (maintained by CSF — cytostatic factor, including Emi2).

(2) Gs activation stimulates adenylyl cyclase → cAMP → PKA activation. (3) ACUTE regulation (minutes): PKA phosphorylates and activates StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), which transports cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane — the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. Without StAR, cholesterol cannot access CYP11A1 (P450scc) in the inner membrane. StAR mutations cause lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia. (4) CHRONIC regulation (hours-days): PKA activates CREB, which induces transcription of steroidogenic enzymes: CYP11A1, CYP17A1, 3β-HSD, and 17β-HSD.

      "explanation": "The semen analysis reveals severe oligozoospermia (2 million/mL, far below the 15 million/mL reference). The key diagnostic clue is the elevated FSH (25 mIU/mL, ~2× upper normal) with normal testosterone (450 ng/dL). This pattern indicates: (1) PRIMARY spermatogenic failure: The seminiferous tubules are failing to produce sperm normally. Possible causes include genetic factors (Y-chromosome microdeletions, Klinefelter syndrome), varicocele, cryptorchidism, or idiopathic. (2) Elevated FSH: Sertoli cells normally produce inhibin B, which provides negative feedback to the anterior pituitary, suppressing FSH. When spermatogenesis fails, Sertoli cell inhibin B production decreases, removing negative feedback and allowing FSH to rise. High FSH is a marker of testicular germ cell damage. (3) Normal testosterone: Leydig cell function (testosterone production) is controlled by LH and is typically preserved in primary spermatogenic failure because the Leydig cell compartment is often intact. In obstructive azoospermia, FSH would be normal (spermatogenesis is occurring but sperm cannot exit). In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, BOTH FSH and testosterone would be low.",

Paternally expressed imprinted genes (IGF2, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1) tend to promote fetal and placental growth.

      "explanation": "Preeclampsia (affecting 3-5% of pregnancies) is a two-stage disease: (1) STAGE 1 — Placental stage (preclinical): Normally, extravillous trophoblast cells invade the uterine spiral arteries, replacing the muscular walls with fibrinoid material. This converts narrow, high-resistance arteries into wide, low-resistance vessels, ensuring adequate placental blood flow. In preeclampsia, this trophoblast invasion is shallow and incomplete. The spiral arteries remain narrow and responsive to vasoconstrictors, leading to intermittent placental ischemia-reperfusion injury. (2) STAGE 2 — Maternal stage (clinical): The hypoxic, stressed placenta releases anti-angiogenic factors into the maternal circulation: sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, which sequesters VEGF and PlGF) and sEng (soluble endoglin). The resulting imbalance between pro-angiogenic (VEGF, PlGF) and anti-angiogenic (sFlt-1, sEng) factors causes widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, manifesting as hypertension (vasoconstriction), proteinuria (glomerular endotheliosis), and potentially HELLP syndrome, eclampsia (seizures), and organ damage.

        "Follicle size has no effect on oocyte quality",

This reflects the concept of oocyte developmental competence — the accumulated capacity of the oocyte to support early embryonic development. As follicles grow, the oocyte undergoes: (1) Cytoplasmic maturation: Accumulation of maternal mRNAs (stored in P-bodies and ribonucleoprotein particles), proteins, ribosomes, mitochondria (increased from ~10,000 to ~100,000-300,000), cortical granules, and metabolic substrates. (2) Nuclear maturation: Acquisition of the ability to resume meiosis and form a proper metaphase II spindle. (3) Epigenetic programming: DNA methylation patterns are established during oocyte growth, including imprinting. (4) Organelle distribution: Mitochondria, ER, and Golgi redistribute appropriately. Oocytes from small follicles can be fertilized and cleave (nuclear maturation occurs) but lack sufficient cytoplasmic reserves to support development to the blastocyst stage and beyond, when embryonic genome activation occurs (8-16 cell stage in cattle).",

This favors traits that increase competitive ability: antlers in deer (used in male-male combat), large body size in elephant seals (males fight for harem access), horns in beetles, and territorial aggression. The sex with higher variance in reproductive success (usually males) experiences stronger intrasexual selection. (2) Intersexual selection (mate choice): Members of one sex (typically females) choose mates based on specific traits. This favors ornaments and displays: peacock tail feathers, bird-of-paradise dances, frog calls, bowerbird bower construction. Female choice may be based on: (a) direct benefits (territory quality, nuptial gifts, parental care ability), (b) indirect genetic benefits (good genes — the handicap principle proposed by Zahavi, where costly ornaments honestly signal genetic quality), or (c) Fisher's runaway selection (arbitrary preference genes become linked to preferred trait genes).

      "explanation": "Fetal-maternal immunological tolerance is an active, multi-layered process: (1) Non-classical MHC expression: The syncytiotrophoblast (in direct contact with maternal blood) expresses NO MHC class I or II molecules. The extravillous trophoblast expresses non-classical HLA-G and HLA-E, which bind inhibitory receptors (KIR2DL4, CD94/NKG2A) on decidual NK cells, preventing cytotoxicity. Classical HLA-A and HLA-B are specifically ABSENT from trophoblast. (2) Regulatory T cells: Decidual Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) are expanded during pregnancy and actively suppress anti-fetal immune responses. They are induced by paternal antigens and seminal fluid factors. Treg depletion causes miscarriage in mice. (3) Cytokine shift: The decidual microenvironment favors Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β) over Th1-type (IFN-γ, TNF-α), though the situation is more nuanced than a simple Th1/Th2 shift. (4) IDO expression: Trophoblast cells express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which depletes tryptophan, inhibiting T cell proliferation.

(3) F2: The germline (primordial germ cells) of the F1 fetus is also present during the F0 exposure period. Therefore, F2 offspring derive from exposed germ cells — still potentially a direct exposure effect. (4) F3: The first generation whose germline was NEVER directly exposed to the EDC. Effects persisting in F3 must be transmitted through epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications, ncRNAs) in the germline that survive reprogramming.

(2) Pelvic ligament relaxation: It loosens the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints, allowing pelvic expansion during birth (most prominent in guinea pigs and rodents). (3) Myometrial quiescence: During most of pregnancy, relaxin inhibits uterine smooth muscle contractions by promoting NO synthesis and opposing oxytocin. Near term, its effect is overcome by the rising oxytocin/prostaglandin levels. (4) Mammary gland development: Synergizes with prolactin and other hormones. (5) Sources: Corpus luteum (primary source in first trimester), decidualized endometrium, placenta. (6) Additional effects: Increases renal blood flow and GFR during pregnancy, promotes angiogenesis.

During spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins (TP1, TP2), then by protamines (P1 and P2 in humans). Protamines are small (~50 amino acids), highly basic proteins (~70% arginine residues) that neutralize the negative charge of DNA phosphate backbone. (2) Toroidal packaging: Protamine-DNA complexes form toroidal (doughnut-shaped) structures containing ~50 kb of DNA each, linked by protamine-free linker regions. This compacts the chromatin to approximately 1/6th the volume of a somatic cell nucleus. (3) Disulfide cross-linking: Inter- and intra-molecular disulfide bonds between protamine cysteine residues further stabilize the compact structure.

This pulsatile pattern is essential because it allows GnRH receptor recycling on pituitary gonadotropes between pulses. (2) Continuous GnRH effect: When GnRH agonists are administered continuously (e.g., leuprolide, goserelin), there is an initial 'flare' of LH and FSH release (days 1-7). However, prolonged receptor occupancy triggers receptor internalization and desensitization — a process called receptor downregulation. Within 2-3 weeks, gonadotropin secretion drops to castrate levels. (3) Clinical applications: This paradoxical suppression is exploited therapeutically in prostate cancer (reducing testosterone), endometriosis, precocious puberty, and IVF protocols (preventing premature LH surge).

      "explanation": "Follicular atresia is the dominant fate of ovarian follicles and represents a massive developmental selection process: (1) Numbers: At approximately 20 weeks of fetal development, the human ovary contains a peak of 6-7 million oogonia/oocytes. By birth, this drops to 1-2 million primary oocytes (arrested in prophase I of meiosis). By puberty, only about 300,000-400,000 remain. During the ~35 years of reproductive life, only 400-500 will be ovulated (~1 per cycle). Thus, greater than 99.9% of oocytes are lost through atresia. (2) Mechanism: Atresia involves apoptosis of granulosa cells and oocyte death, mediated by pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (BAX, BAD) when survival signals (FSH, growth factors like Kit ligand) are insufficient. (3) Selection: During each cycle, a cohort of follicles begins to grow, but only the dominant follicle (with highest FSH sensitivity and aromatase activity) survives the drop in FSH caused by rising inhibin B and estradiol. The rest undergo atresia. (4) Clinical relevance: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels reflect the remaining primordial follicle pool and serve as a biomarker of ovarian reserve.",

      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — The human zona pellucida consists of four glycoproteins: ZP1 (serves as cross-linker connecting ZP2-ZP3 filaments), ZP2 (secondary receptor after acrosome reaction), ZP3 (primary receptor for acrosome-intact sperm), and ZP4 (structural role). In mice, only ZP1-3 are present. These form heterodimeric filaments (ZP2-ZP3) cross-linked by ZP1 homodimers. (II) TRUE — ZP3 is the primary sperm receptor. The O-linked oligosaccharides on ZP3 mediate initial species-specific sperm binding. This binding triggers the acrosome reaction via a G-protein coupled signaling cascade involving calcium influx. After the acrosome reaction, acrosome-reacted sperm bind ZP2 for secondary binding and zona penetration. (III) TRUE — The cortical reaction releases cortical granule contents (including ovastacin, a metalloendoprotease) that cleave ZP2 and modify ZP3 glycans. Ovastacin specifically cleaves ZP2, converting it from a sperm-binding form to a non-binding form. This 'zona hardening' prevents additional sperm penetration. (IV) FALSE — The zona pellucida is primarily synthesized by the oocyte itself, not by granulosa cells. While granulosa cells may contribute some ZP components in certain species, the oocyte is the major source of all four ZP proteins. This has been confirmed by oocyte-specific knockout studies.",

      "explanation": "The scrotal location of testes in most mammals is essential for maintaining a temperature 2-4°C below core body temperature (~35°C vs 37°C), which is required for normal spermatogenesis: (1) Temperature sensitivity: Several key processes are temperature-sensitive, including DNA synthesis during premeiotic S phase, meiotic recombination, and post-meiotic spermatid differentiation. Specific heat-sensitive enzymes include those involved in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. (2) Germ cell apoptosis: At core body temperature, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (via p53, BAX) trigger massive germ cell death, particularly of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. (3) Heat shock response: Elevated temperature induces heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90) which, while protective at moderate levels, signal cellular stress. (4) Thermoregulation: The pampiniform venous plexus (countercurrent heat exchange), cremaster muscle (raising/lowering testes), and dartos muscle (scrotal skin wrinkling) all contribute to testicular temperature regulation. (5) Clinical significance: Cryptorchidism affects 1-3% of full-term male newborns, and if uncorrected by age 1-2 years, leads to progressive loss of germ cells and increased testicular cancer risk.",

      "explanation": "The data illustrate the sequential functional changes sperm undergo en route to fertilization: (1) Capacitation: After 3 hours in capacitation medium, progressive motility slightly decreases (65→58%), but hyperactivation dramatically increases (2→35%). Capacitation involves cholesterol efflux from the sperm membrane, increase in intracellular calcium, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activation. This primes sperm for the acrosome reaction and enables hyperactivated motility (vigorous asymmetric flagellar beating needed to penetrate the zona). (2) Progesterone effect: Cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte secrete progesterone, which acts on the CatSper channel (a sperm-specific calcium channel) to further increase intracellular Ca2+ and enhance hyperactivation (35→68%). The slight decrease in progressive motility (58→52%) reflects the shift from linear swimming to the vigorous whiplash pattern of hyperactivation. (3) ZP3 effect: ZP3 glycoprotein triggers the acrosome reaction — exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle contents. Post-acrosome-reacted sperm show dramatically reduced progressive motility (12%) and hyperactivation (8%) because they are no longer freely swimming but rather interacting with the zona pellucida. These data demonstrate the physiological cascade: capacitation → hyperactivation → acrosome reaction.",

      "explanation": "Parthenogenesis in whiptail lizards (genus Aspidoscelis, formerly Cnemidophorus) is a well-studied example of obligate parthenogenesis in vertebrates: (1) Origin: These all-female species arose from hybridization events between sexual species. A. uniparens is a diploid hybrid-origin species. (2) Mechanism: Diploidy is maintained through premeiotic endoreduplication — the genome is doubled before meiosis begins, so that after meiosis the oocyte retains a diploid chromosome complement. In some parthenogenetic species, an alternative mechanism involves fusion of the second polar body with the egg pronucleus to restore diploidy. (3) Pseudocopulation: Despite being all-female, individuals exhibit mating behavior — one female mounts another, simulating copulation. This behavior stimulates ovulation and is correlated with hormonal cycles (females alternate between estrogen-dominant and progesterone-dominant phases). (4) Genetic consequence: Offspring are clones of the mother (barring rare mitotic recombination events), reducing genetic diversity. However, these species persist due to the 'twofold cost of sex' advantage — all individuals produce offspring.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Luteolysis (regression of the corpus luteum) is a critical event in the estrous/menstrual cycle and its mechanism differs between species: (1) Non-primate mammals: PGF2α is the primary luteolytic factor. It is synthesized by the uterine endometrium and reaches the ovary via a local countercurrent transfer mechanism — PGF2α diffuses from the uterine vein into the closely apposed ovarian artery (utero-ovarian vascular plexus). PGF2α binds to FP receptors on luteal cells, activating protein kinase C, reducing StAR protein expression, and triggering apoptosis of luteal cells. (2) Proof: Hysterectomy in non-primate mammals prevents luteolysis, extending the corpus luteum's lifespan — demonstrating the uterine origin of the luteolytic signal. (3) Pregnancy rescue: In ruminants, the conceptus secretes interferon-tau (IFN-τ), which suppresses endometrial PGF2α production and prevents luteolysis ('maternal recognition of pregnancy'). In pigs, embryonic estrogen redirects PGF2α secretion from endocrine (into blood) to exocrine (into uterine lumen). (4) Primates: The mechanism differs — primate corpus luteum regression appears to be largely an intrinsic process, though local prostaglandins play a role. hCG from the implanting embryo rescues the corpus luteum in pregnancy.",

      "explanation": "The CatSper channel is a sperm-specific, pH-sensitive, voltage-gated calcium channel essential for hyperactivated motility and fertilization. The most rigorous experimental approach combines genetic, physiological, and functional evidence: (1) Genetic approach: CatSper knockout mice provide the gold standard — they eliminate CatSper function specifically without off-target effects of pharmacological inhibitors. This was actually done by Ren et al. (2001) who showed CatSper1 knockout males are completely infertile despite producing morphologically normal sperm with normal initial motility. (2) In vivo mating: Comparing knockout × wild-type to wild-type × wild-type mating outcomes (pregnancy rate, litter size) directly tests the in vivo requirement. (3) In vitro verification: IVF assays allow controlled conditions to distinguish whether failure occurs at capacitation, hyperactivation, zona penetration, or sperm-egg fusion. (4) Calcium imaging: Measuring intracellular calcium in CatSper knockout vs wild-type sperm (using Fluo-4 or similar indicators) confirms the molecular mechanism.

The transition from oviparity requires solving several major physiological challenges: (1) Gas exchange: The developing embryo requires oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal. Solutions include highly vascularized uterine walls (squamate reptiles), placentae (mammals, some sharks, some lizards), and branchial structures in live-bearing fish. (2) Nutrient transfer: Beyond yolk reserves, viviparous species must evolve mechanisms for maternal nutrient provision — ranging from histotrophy (uterine secretions, as in some sharks and the marsupial-like condition) to hemochorial placentation (direct maternal blood contact in humans). (3) Immunological tolerance: The embryo expresses paternal antigens that should trigger maternal immune rejection. Solutions include HLA-G expression by trophoblasts, regulatory T cells, progesterone-mediated immune suppression, and decidual NK cell modulation. (4) Waste removal: Embryonic metabolic waste must be transferred to the maternal circulation.

      "explanation": "Kisspeptin (encoded by the KISS1 gene) is arguably the most important upstream regulator of GnRH neurons and its discovery revolutionized reproductive neuroendocrinology: (1) Discovery: Loss-of-function mutations in the kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R, formerly GPR54) were found to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (absent puberty) in humans, establishing kisspeptin as essential for reproductive function. (2) Two populations: Kisspeptin neurons exist in two hypothalamic nuclei with distinct functions. In the arcuate nucleus (ARC/infundibular nucleus), kisspeptin neurons co-express neurokinin B and dynorphin (forming 'KNDy' neurons) and mediate the GnRH pulse generator. They also mediate negative feedback — estrogen and testosterone suppress kisspeptin expression here, reducing GnRH pulse frequency. (3) Positive feedback: In the AVPV (anteroventral periventricular nucleus) in rodents (or equivalent in humans), kisspeptin neurons mediate the positive feedback effect of estrogen — high estrogen during the late follicular phase stimulates kisspeptin release from AVPV neurons, driving the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge. (4) Puberty: The onset of puberty is triggered by increased kisspeptin signaling, possibly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.

During epididymal transit (which takes 2-12 days in humans), sperm acquire progressive motility and the ability to undergo capacitation and the acrosome reaction. (II) TRUE — The epididymis has three anatomical regions: the caput (head) receives sperm from the efferent ductules and begins maturation; the corpus (body) continues maturation processes; and the cauda (tail) serves primarily as a storage reservoir where mature sperm accumulate and can be held for extended periods. (III) TRUE — Epididymal maturation involves extensive remodeling of the sperm surface. This includes: addition of decapacitation factors (proteins that stabilize the membrane and prevent premature capacitation), modification of surface glycoproteins, changes in membrane lipid composition (increased cholesterol/phospholipid ratio), and addition of epididymal secretory proteins (e.g., CRISP1, CD52). These changes are essential for later capacitation in the female tract. (IV) FALSE — While the cauda does serve as a storage site, sperm viability during storage is limited. Stored sperm undergo gradual senescence, with DNA fragmentation increasing over time. In humans, prolonged abstinence (more than 5-7 days) leads to decreased sperm quality.

This is the opposite of protandry (male-to-female change seen in clownfish). (2) Social control: The dominant terminal-phase male maintains a harem. His presence actively suppresses sex change in females through behavioral intimidation and possibly pheromonal signals. When the dominant male is removed (death, predation, or experimental removal), the largest female begins sex change within hours — behavioral changes (increased aggression, courtship displays) occur within minutes to hours, and full gonadal transformation (ovary to testis) completes within 8-14 days. (3) Mechanism: The sex change involves dramatic gonadal restructuring — oocytes undergo apoptosis, Leydig-like cells proliferate, and spermatogenesis begins. This is accompanied by changes in aromatase expression (decreased) and androgen production (increased). Brain monoamine systems (serotonin, arginine vasotocin) also change.

      "explanation": "The copper IUD (e.g., Paragard) is a highly effective, non-hormonal, long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) with multiple mechanisms of action: (1) Spermicidal effect: Cu2+ ions released from the copper wire are directly toxic to sperm. Copper impairs sperm motility, viability, and acrosome reaction capacity. In vitro studies show that concentrations of copper found in uterine fluid of Cu-IUD users significantly reduce sperm progressive motility and ability to penetrate cervical mucus. (2) Inflammatory reaction: The IUD as a foreign body induces a sterile inflammatory response in the endometrium, characterized by increased leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes), cytokines, and prostaglandins. This creates an environment hostile to both sperm survival and embryo implantation. (3) Pre-fertilization effect: The primary mechanism is pre-fertilization — preventing sperm from reaching and fertilizing the egg. Studies of tubal flushing in Cu-IUD users rarely find fertilized eggs, confirming that fertilization is prevented rather than implantation being the main mechanism. (4) Tubal effects: Copper ions also affect the fallopian tube environment, further reducing the likelihood of fertilization. (5) Emergency contraception: The Cu-IUD can be used as emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse, with >99% effectiveness. (6) Duration: Effective for 10-12 years, with fertility returning immediately upon removal.",

      "explanation": "Sperm chemotaxis toward the oocyte is a well-established phenomenon, and the proposed experimental design addresses the hypothesis rigorously: (1) Microfluidic chemotaxis assay: This is the gold standard for studying chemotaxis. A gradient of the test substance (follicular fluid) is established in a microchannel, and individual sperm trajectories are tracked using video microscopy. The directionality of sperm movement is quantified by comparing the proportion of sperm swimming toward the follicular fluid versus a buffer control. (2) Controls: Using culture medium alone as a negative control establishes baseline random swimming. Heat-inactivated follicular fluid (e.g., 56°C for 30 minutes) tests whether the chemoattractant is a heat-labile protein — if heat treatment abolishes chemotaxis, the factor is likely proteinaceous. Additional controls include: follicular fluid from different-sized follicles (preovulatory vs small antral), dose-response curves, and protease-treated follicular fluid. (3) Known chemoattractants: Research has identified progesterone and bourgeonal (a synthetic odorant that activates the sperm receptor hOR17-4/OR1D2) as sperm chemoattractants. Follicular fluid contains progesterone which acts via the CatSper channel. (4) Specificity: Only capacitated sperm show chemotaxis, as non-capacitated sperm lack the signaling machinery.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Avian sex determination uses a fundamentally different genetic mechanism than mammals: (1) ZW system: In birds, males are homogametic (ZZ) and females are heterogametic (ZW). This is the reverse of the mammalian XX/XY system. The W chromosome is largely heterochromatic and gene-poor (analogous to the Y chromosome but not homologous). (2) DMRT1 dosage: The key sex-determining gene is DMRT1 (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor 1) located on the Z chromosome. Males (ZZ) have two copies and females (ZW) have one copy. This dosage difference, rather than a single dominant gene like SRY, drives sex determination. Knockdown of DMRT1 in ZZ embryos using RNA interference leads to feminization of the gonad (ovary-like development), while overexpression of DMRT1 in ZW embryos partially masculinizes the gonad. (3) No SRY equivalent: Birds lack SRY entirely. The W chromosome does not carry a single dominant female-determining gene equivalent to SRY; instead, the absence of the second DMRT1 copy leads to female development. (4) Conservation: DMRT1/Dmrt1 homologs play roles in sex determination across diverse taxa including fish, reptiles, and invertebrates, suggesting it is an ancient sex-determining gene that predates the evolution of SRY in mammals. (5) SOX9: While SOX9 is important in both mammalian and avian gonadal development, it acts downstream of the primary sex determination signal.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lactation requires two distinct hormonal processes that are often confused: (1) Prolactin — milk production: Prolactin is released from lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. It acts on prolactin receptors (JAK-STAT signaling) on mammary alveolar epithelial cells to stimulate transcription of milk protein genes (casein, lactalbumin, whey proteins) and enzymes for lactose synthesis. Prolactin secretion is tonically inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine; during suckling, this inhibition is transiently released, causing prolactin surges. (2) Oxytocin — milk ejection: Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus (paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei) and released from the posterior pituitary. It acts on oxytocin receptors on myoepithelial cells — contractile cells that surround the alveoli like a basket. Contraction of myoepithelial cells squeezes milk from alveoli into the duct system and toward the nipple. (3) Neuroendocrine reflex: Suckling stimulates mechanoreceptors in the nipple, sending afferent signals via the spinal cord to the hypothalamus. This triggers both oxytocin release (rapid, pulsatile) and prolactin release (slower, sustained). (4) Conditioning: Oxytocin release can become conditioned — hearing a baby cry can trigger milk let-down before suckling begins. (5) Amenorrhea: Elevated prolactin during lactation suppresses GnRH pulsatility, contributing to lactational amenorrhea (a natural contraceptive effect).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "AMH/MIS is a glycoprotein member of the TGF-beta superfamily with critical roles in sexual differentiation and adult reproductive function: (1) Source: Sertoli cells of the fetal testis begin producing AMH at approximately week 8 of human gestation, under the control of SOX9 and SF1 transcription factors. AMH production is one of the earliest functions of Sertoli cells, occurring before testosterone production by Leydig cells. (2) Function in male development: AMH binds to AMH type II receptors (AMHR2) on Müllerian duct mesenchyme, triggering a signaling cascade that causes apoptosis and regression of the Müllerian ducts. In the absence of AMH (as in females, or in males with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome due to AMH or AMHR2 mutations), the Müllerian ducts persist and develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina. (3) Two-signal model: Male sexual differentiation requires both AMH (Müllerian duct regression) AND testosterone (Wolffian duct development and virilization). These are produced by different cell types (Sertoli vs Leydig) and act on different structures. (4) Adult function: In adult women, AMH is produced by granulosa cells of small antral follicles and inhibits primordial follicle recruitment, serving as a clinical biomarker of ovarian reserve. In adult males, AMH levels decline after puberty as testosterone suppresses Sertoli cell AMH expression.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ectopic pregnancy occurs in approximately 1-2% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of first-trimester maternal mortality: (1) Location: Approximately 95% of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, with the ampulla (the distal, widened portion where fertilization normally occurs) being the most common site (~70% of tubal ectopics). Other tubal sites include the isthmus (~12%) and fimbria (~11%). Non-tubal ectopic sites (ovarian, cervical, abdominal, caesarean scar) are rarer. (2) Pathophysiology: The fallopian tube lacks the thick, distensible myometrium and specialized decidual response of the uterus. As the trophoblast invades the thin tubal wall, it erodes blood vessels, causing hemorrhage. The tube can rupture at 6-8 weeks gestation, causing massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. (3) Risk factors: Prior tubal damage (PID, salpingitis especially from Chlamydia trachomatis), previous ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery, endometriosis, smoking (impairs tubal motility and ciliary function), and IVF.

      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — During fetal development, oogonia enter meiosis and arrest at the dictyate stage of prophase I (a specialized prolonged diplotene stage). In humans, this arrest begins prenatally (around month 5 of fetal life) and can last up to 50+ years until ovulation or atresia. The arrested oocyte has a large germinal vesicle (intact nuclear envelope) and decondensed chromosomes with lampbrush chromosome morphology (active transcription). (II) TRUE — Meiotic arrest is maintained by high intracellular cAMP in the oocyte. cAMP is generated by constitutively active GPR3 receptor signaling and supplemented by cAMP and cGMP transferred from granulosa cells through gap junctions (connexin-37). High cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates and inactivates CDC25B phosphatase, preventing activation of CDK1/cyclin B (maturation promoting factor, MPF). The LH surge triggers closure of gap junctions (via MAPK-dependent connexin phosphorylation) and reduces cGMP transfer, leading to cAMP decrease, PKA inactivation, CDC25B activation, and MPF activation — driving germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). (III) TRUE — After completing meiosis I with asymmetric cytokinesis (first polar body extrusion), the oocyte immediately enters meiosis II and arrests at metaphase II. This MII arrest is maintained by cytostatic factor (CSF), primarily the Emi2/Erp1 protein that inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The oocyte remains at MII until fertilization, when the sperm-induced calcium oscillations activate CaMKII, which phosphorylates Emi2, targeting it for degradation and allowing APC/C to activate, triggering completion of meiosis II. (IV) FALSE — MII arrest is not maintained by progesterone acting on nuclear receptors. It is maintained by cytostatic factor (CSF), specifically the Mos-MEK-MAPK-p90Rsk pathway that stabilizes Emi2/Erp1 protein. While progesterone plays a role in oocyte maturation in amphibians (Xenopus), in mammals the arrest mechanism is CSF/Emi2-dependent, not progesterone-dependent at the oocyte level.",

      "explanation": "Capacitation is a complex series of molecular changes that sperm must undergo in the female tract before they can fertilize an oocyte: (1) Cholesterol efflux: The sperm plasma membrane has a high cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio that stabilizes the membrane. Albumin and HDL in uterine/oviductal fluid act as cholesterol acceptors, removing cholesterol and increasing membrane fluidity. This is the initial and critical step of capacitation. (2) Downstream signaling: Cholesterol removal exposes membrane proteins and activates signaling pathways: (a) Activation of bicarbonate-sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC/ADCY10), increasing cAMP; (b) PKA activation, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins; (c) Hyperpolarization of the membrane potential via potassium channels; (d) Increase in intracellular pH via NHE (Na+/H+ exchanger). (3) Functional changes: These molecular events enable hyperactivated motility (vigorous asymmetric flagellar beating mediated by CatSper channel activation) and prime the sperm for the acrosome reaction upon contact with the zona pellucida. (4) Decapacitation factors: Seminal plasma contains decapacitation factors that prevent premature capacitation. These are removed or diluted as sperm ascend the female tract. (5) Time course: Capacitation takes 5-7 hours in humans. This delay ensures that most sperm reaching the oocyte are freshly capacitated and functionally competent.",

This is the FM pattern (females at low temperatures, males at high temperatures), found in some turtles, lizards, and the tuatara. The pivotal temperature (producing ~50:50 sex ratio) is approximately 28°C for both populations. (2) TSD patterns: There are three main TSD patterns: Type Ia (FM) as shown here, Type Ib (MF, the opposite), and Type II (FMF, with females at both extremes). (3) Climate change concern: If global temperatures rise, nest temperatures will increase, shifting sex ratios dramatically toward males. At 30°C, only 15-20% are female; at 32°C, only 5-8%. This could create severe sex ratio imbalance, reducing effective population size and potentially leading to population collapse due to insufficient females for reproduction. (4) Thermal tolerance: Hatchling survival peaks at 28°C (93%) and declines at extremes, suggesting that optimal development temperature coincidentally produces balanced sex ratios. At 32°C, survival drops to 65%, compounding the sex ratio problem. (5) Adaptation potential: Whether TSD species can adapt to rapid climate change through shifts in pivotal temperature or nesting behavior is an active research question. Behavioral thermoregulation (nest site selection, nesting phenology shifts) may partially buffer against climate effects.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Clownfish are the classic example of protandrous (male-to-female) sequential hermaphroditism, contrasting with the protogynous (female-to-male) wrasses: (1) Social structure: Clownfish live in strict dominance hierarchies on sea anemones. Each anemone hosts a single breeding pair: one large dominant female and one smaller breeding male, plus several non-breeding juveniles ranked by size. (2) Sex change trigger: When the dominant female dies or is removed, the breeding male undergoes sex change to become female. This involves gonadal transformation — the testicular tissue regresses and ovarian tissue (which was suppressed but present) develops. Simultaneously, the largest juvenile becomes the new breeding male. (3) Mechanism: Social suppression by the dominant female maintains male status. The female's aggressive behavior and possibly pheromonal signals inhibit the HPG axis changes that would trigger sex reversal. Her removal releases this inhibition. Aromatase (CYP19) expression increases during the male-to-female transition, converting androgens to estrogens and promoting ovarian development. Brain and gonadal aromatase changes occur concurrently. (4) Size advantage model: Protandry is favored when female fecundity increases disproportionately with body size (larger females produce exponentially more eggs), while male reproductive success is less size-dependent. Thus, being female when large and male when small maximizes lifetime reproductive fitness. (5) Bidirectional potential: While protandry is the norm, some studies suggest limited plasticity — clownfish sex change is generally considered unidirectional (male-to-female only).",

      "explanation": "Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women and its pathogenesis is multifactorial: (1) Sampson's theory (retrograde menstruation): The most widely accepted theory proposes that during menstruation, viable endometrial fragments reflux through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity. Evidence: retrograde menstruation occurs in 90% of women (shown by laparoscopy during menses), but only 10% develop endometriosis, suggesting additional factors are required. (2) Immune dysfunction: Normal peritoneal immune surveillance (macrophages, NK cells) should clear ectopic endometrial cells. In women with endometriosis, there is evidence of impaired NK cell cytotoxicity, altered macrophage function (increased inflammatory cytokine production but decreased phagocytosis), and increased levels of anti-apoptotic factors that allow ectopic cells to survive. (3) Aromatase expression: A key molecular mechanism — ectopic endometrial lesions aberrantly express aromatase (CYP19A1), which is normally absent from eutopic endometrium. This allows local conversion of androgens to estrogens, creating an autocrine loop that sustains lesion growth independent of ovarian estrogen. Additionally, lesions have decreased 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, reducing estrogen inactivation. (4) Other theories: Coelomic metaplasia (peritoneal cells transform into endometrial cells), lymphatic/vascular dissemination (explains rare distant endometriosis in lungs), and stem/progenitor cell theory.

      "explanation": "The Ferguson reflex is one of the best-known examples of positive feedback in physiology, and demonstrating it requires multiple lines of evidence: (1) Correlational evidence: Measuring plasma oxytocin during labor should show progressively increasing levels as contractions intensify and cervical dilation progresses. This was demonstrated by studies showing oxytocin pulses increase in frequency and amplitude as labor advances. Unlike negative feedback (which returns a variable to a set point), positive feedback amplifies the response — stretching of the cervix stimulates more oxytocin release, which causes stronger contractions, which pushes the fetus further into the cervix, causing more stretch, and so on. (2) Causal evidence: Manual cervical stretch in anesthetized animals (eliminating voluntary responses) should trigger oxytocin release, demonstrating that cervical mechanoreceptors directly activate the neuroendocrine reflex arc (sensory neurons → spinal cord → hypothalamus → posterior pituitary → oxytocin release). This was classically demonstrated by Ferguson in 1941 using rabbits. (3) Afferent pathway: The reflex arc involves sensory neurons from the cervix traveling via pelvic nerves to the spinal cord, then ascending to the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. (4) Termination: The positive feedback loop terminates with delivery of the fetus and placenta, removing the cervical stretch stimulus. (5) Option A demonstrates oxytocin's effect but not the feedback mechanism. Option C would show compensatory mechanisms but not the feedback loop itself.",

        "The ovipositor, which deposits eggs with stored sperm",

      "explanation": "The spermatheca is a remarkable adaptation for sperm storage found in many insect orders: (1) Structure: The spermatheca is a sclerotized (hardened cuticle-lined) organ connected to the common oviduct by a spermathecal duct. It often has associated glands (spermathecal glands) that secrete nutrients and maintain sperm viability. In Drosophila, two types of sperm storage organs exist: the seminal receptacle and paired spermathecae. (2) Function: Stored sperm can remain viable for extraordinary periods. In honeybee queens (Apis mellifera), sperm stored in the spermatheca remain viable for 4-5 years — the queen mates during a single nuptial flight and uses stored sperm to fertilize millions of eggs throughout her lifetime. In some ant queens, sperm storage lasts 20+ years. (3) Selective fertilization: Females can control which stored sperm fertilize their eggs, enabling cryptic female choice. In species that mate with multiple males, the spermatheca allows sperm from different males to compete (sperm competition) or be selectively used. (4) Maintenance mechanisms: The spermathecal environment maintains sperm in a quiescent state through low oxygen tension, specific pH, and secreted glycoproteins. Antioxidant enzymes (catalase, SOD) protect stored sperm from oxidative damage. (5) Evolutionary significance: Sperm storage decouples mating from fertilization, giving females temporal control over reproduction and reducing the need for repeated risky mating encounters.",

      "options": [
        "Inhibin B is produced by Leydig cells and stimulates GnRH release",
        "Inhibin B is produced by Sertoli cells in proportion to spermatogenic activity and selectively suppresses FSH secretion from the anterior pituitary, forming a negative feedback loop that regulates the rate of spermatogenesis",

        "Inhibin B stimulates both LH and FSH equally to accelerate sperm production"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Inhibin B is a key regulatory hormone in the HPG axis feedback system: (1) Source: Inhibin B is a heterodimeric glycoprotein (alpha-betaB subunit) produced by Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules. Its production is stimulated by FSH and correlates with Sertoli cell number and spermatogenic activity. (2) Target: Inhibin B acts specifically on gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary to selectively suppress FSH secretion without significantly affecting LH secretion. This selectivity is because inhibin antagonizes the stimulatory effect of activin (a related TGF-beta family member) on FSH beta-subunit gene transcription. (3) Feedback loop: When spermatogenesis is active and healthy, Sertoli cells produce high levels of inhibin B, which suppresses FSH — a classic negative feedback loop. When spermatogenesis is impaired (e.g., in germ cell aplasia, after chemotherapy), inhibin B levels fall, FSH rises (released from negative feedback), stimulating remaining Sertoli cells to support whatever germ cells remain. (4) Clinical utility: Serum inhibin B is used as a clinical marker of spermatogenic function. Low inhibin B with elevated FSH suggests primary spermatogenic failure. (5) Activin: The counterpart of inhibin — activin (betaB-betaB homodimer) stimulates FSH secretion. Follistatin, produced locally, binds and neutralizes activin. The inhibin-activin-follistatin system provides fine-tuned control of FSH levels. (6) In females: Inhibin B is produced by granulosa cells of growing follicles (early follicular phase) while inhibin A predominates in the luteal phase.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — hPL is a 191 amino acid polypeptide produced by syncytiotrophoblast cells. It shares significant structural homology with growth hormone (GH, 85% amino acid sequence identity) and prolactin (13% identity), all belonging to the somatotropin/prolactin gene family. This structural similarity underlies hPL's diverse metabolic and lactogenic activities. (II) TRUE — hPL stimulates lipolysis (breakdown of triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol) in maternal adipose tissue. The released free fatty acids serve as the primary maternal energy substrate, reducing maternal glucose utilization and redirecting glucose to the fetus. This 'metabolic reprogramming' is one of the major maternal adaptations to pregnancy. (III) TRUE — hPL is a potent diabetogenic hormone. It reduces maternal insulin sensitivity by: (a) decreasing insulin receptor autophosphorylation, (b) reducing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in maternal skeletal muscle, and (c) promoting hepatic glucose output. This insulin resistance ensures adequate glucose supply to the fetus but can unmask latent diabetes in susceptible women, causing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The diabetogenic effect increases with advancing gestation as hPL levels rise. (IV) FALSE — hPL levels increase progressively throughout pregnancy, roughly in proportion to placental mass. Levels are low in the first trimester, rise steadily, and peak in the third trimester (around weeks 32-36) at concentrations of 5-7 mg/L, making hPL one of the most abundantly produced hormones in pregnancy. The decline occurs only after delivery with placental expulsion.",

      "explanation": "HLA-G is a cornerstone of maternal-fetal immune tolerance and its biology represents a fascinating example of immune evasion: (1) Expression pattern: The placental trophoblast does NOT express classical polymorphic HLA class I molecules (HLA-A, HLA-B) that would present paternal antigens to maternal T cells. Instead, extravillous trophoblast cells express the non-classical, oligomorphic HLA-G (along with HLA-C and HLA-E). This unique expression pattern is key to preventing allograft rejection. (2) Inhibitory function: HLA-G binds to inhibitory receptors on immune cells: (a) ILT-2 (LILRB1) on T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes — delivers inhibitory signals via ITIM motifs; (b) ILT-4 (LILRB2) on monocytes and dendritic cells — inhibits antigen presentation; (c) KIR2DL4 on uterine NK cells — both inhibitory and activating signaling, with the net effect of promoting tolerance and angiogenic factor secretion. (3) Mechanisms of tolerance: HLA-G inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity, CD8+ T cell proliferation, and CD4+ T cell alloproliferative responses. It also promotes the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells. Soluble HLA-G (shed from the surface) can induce apoptosis of activated CD8+ T cells via Fas/FasL interactions.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data illustrate the classical hormonal cascade of the ovarian-uterine cycle during assisted reproduction: (1) Follicular phase (days 3-14): Estradiol rises progressively (45→1200 pg/mL) as the dominant follicle grows and its granulosa cells produce increasing amounts of estradiol via aromatization of thecal androgens. LH remains relatively stable (5-6 mIU/mL) during this phase due to negative feedback of estradiol at moderate levels. Endometrial thickness increases (3→11 mm) due to estrogen-driven proliferation (proliferative phase). (2) Positive feedback trigger: When estradiol exceeds a threshold (~200 pg/mL sustained for >36-48 hours), it switches from negative to positive feedback on the hypothalamus/pituitary, triggering the LH surge (58 mIU/mL on day 14). This surge triggers the final stages of oocyte maturation (resumption of meiosis I), follicular rupture (ovulation ~36 hours post-surge), and luteinization. (3) Luteal phase (days 16-21): After ovulation, the collapsed follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces high levels of progesterone (0.8→22 ng/mL). Estradiol drops sharply (1200→180 pg/mL) then is maintained at moderate levels by the corpus luteum. Progesterone transforms the estrogen-primed endometrium from proliferative to secretory phase (glycogen accumulation, spiral arteriole development, decidualization) — preparing for potential implantation. (4) Endometrium: The continued thickening (11→13 mm) during the luteal phase reflects secretory transformation rather than proliferation.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "PCOS affects 6-12% of reproductive-age women and is diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria (2 of 3: oligo/anovulation, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound): (1) Elevated LH:FSH ratio: The GnRH pulse generator has increased frequency in PCOS, which preferentially stimulates LH secretion over FSH (fast GnRH pulses favor LH-beta subunit transcription). This creates an LH:FSH ratio typically >2:1. (2) Hyperandrogenism: Elevated LH hyperstimulates theca cells, causing excessive androgen production (testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-S). The relatively low FSH means granulosa cell aromatase activity is insufficient to convert all thecal androgens to estrogens. Clinical manifestations include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia. (3) Arrested folliculogenesis: Multiple small antral follicles (2-9 mm) accumulate but no dominant follicle emerges. This is because the low FSH environment cannot support selection and maturation of a single dominant follicle. The 'polycystic' ovarian morphology on ultrasound (>12 follicles per ovary, each 2-9 mm) reflects this arrested development. (4) Insulin resistance: 50-70% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, independent of BMI. Hyperinsulinemia directly stimulates thecal androgen production (via insulin receptors on theca cells) and reduces hepatic SHBG synthesis, increasing free testosterone. (5) Anovulation: The combination of elevated androgens, disturbed gonadotropin ratio, and arrested follicular development leads to chronic anovulation, which is the primary cause of PCOS-related infertility.",

      "explanation": "The rete testis and efferent ductules are critical components of the intratesticular excurrent duct system: (1) Rete testis: This is an anastomosing network of channels located in the mediastinum testis (the connective tissue core of the testis). Sperm released from the seminiferous tubules by spermiation enter the tubuli recti (straight tubules) and then the rete testis. The rete testis collects sperm from all seminiferous tubules and channels them toward the efferent ductules. Its simple cuboidal epithelium produces a small amount of fluid. (2) Efferent ductules: 12-20 efferent ductules (ductuli efferentes) connect the rete testis to the head of the epididymis (caput epididymidis). Their most important function is massive fluid reabsorption — approximately 90% of the testicular fluid is reabsorbed by the efferent ductule epithelium. This concentrates sperm from approximately 10 million/mL in rete testis fluid to approximately 100 million/mL entering the epididymis. (3) Mechanism: Fluid reabsorption is driven by estrogen-regulated aquaporins and ion transporters. Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is highly expressed in efferent ductules, and ESR1 knockout mice develop efferent ductule dilation, fluid accumulation, and infertility due to back-pressure damage to the testis. (4) Ciliated cells: The efferent ductule epithelium alternates between ciliated cells (which create fluid currents to move sperm) and non-ciliated absorptive cells.

      "explanation": "Germ cell apoptosis in C. elegans is a fascinating example of physiological cell death serving a constructive purpose: (1) Frequency: Approximately 50% of female germ cells in the C. elegans gonad undergo apoptosis. This is not pathological but rather a developmentally programmed process regulated by the core apoptotic machinery (CED-9/BCL-2, CED-4/Apaf-1, CED-3/caspase). (2) Nurse cell function: The dying germ cells act as nurse cells — they are connected to surviving oocytes through cytoplasmic bridges (ring canals). Before and during apoptosis, cytoplasmic contents including ribosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, mRNAs, and proteins are transported into the developing oocyte through these bridges. This 'cytoplasmic dumping' dramatically increases oocyte volume and provisions it with maternally provided developmental determinants. (3) Parallel in Drosophila: This mirrors the nurse cell system in Drosophila, where 15 nurse cells (which share a common origin with the oocyte through 4 rounds of mitosis with incomplete cytokinesis) dump their cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte before undergoing apoptosis. (4) Quality control: In addition to the nurse cell function, germ cell apoptosis in C. elegans also serves a quality control role — oocytes with DNA damage are preferentially eliminated through a p53/CEP-1-dependent checkpoint.

      "explanation": "AMH as an ovarian reserve marker is one of the most important clinical applications in reproductive medicine: (1) Source in adult females: AMH is produced by granulosa cells of preantral (primary and secondary) and small antral follicles (up to ~6 mm diameter). It is NOT produced by primordial follicles (which have flat pre-granulosa cells that do not express AMH) or by large antral/preovulatory follicles (AMH expression declines as follicles grow beyond ~8 mm and become FSH-dependent). (2) Correlation with follicle pool: The number of preantral and small antral follicles at any given time reflects the rate of primordial follicle recruitment, which is proportional to the total remaining primordial follicle reserve. As the primordial pool diminishes with age, fewer follicles are recruited, fewer small antral follicles are present, and serum AMH levels decline. (3) Clinical advantages: AMH is relatively cycle-independent (unlike FSH, which varies significantly with the menstrual cycle), has minimal inter-cycle variability, and provides a continuous gradient rather than a threshold value. Normal values decline with age from ~3-4 ng/mL at age 25 to <1 ng/mL approaching menopause. (4) Function of AMH in the ovary: AMH inhibits primordial follicle recruitment (slowing the rate of pool depletion) and reduces follicular sensitivity to FSH (preventing too many follicles from being selected in each cycle).

      "explanation": "Cholesterol efflux is the initiating event of sperm capacitation, and specific molecules in the female tract drive this process: (1) Cholesterol acceptors: Albumin is the primary cholesterol acceptor in reproductive tract fluid. It binds cholesterol through hydrophobic pockets, removing it from the sperm plasma membrane. HDL particles also serve as efficient cholesterol acceptors through ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters (ATP-binding cassette transporters that are expressed on the sperm surface). (2) Membrane consequences: The sperm membrane has a high cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio (contributed by epididymal cholesterol loading and seminal plasma cholesterol) that stabilizes the bilayer. Removal of cholesterol increases membrane fluidity, enables lateral redistribution of membrane proteins (including receptors for ZP3), and activates membrane-associated signaling molecules. (3) Signaling cascade: Cholesterol removal activates a bicarbonate (HCO3-)-responsive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC/ADCY10), which produces cAMP. This activates PKA, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins — the molecular hallmark of capacitation. (4) In vitro capacitation: This understanding enables IVF laboratories to capacitate sperm in vitro using media supplemented with BSA (bovine serum albumin) and bicarbonate.

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Estrogen stimulates the cervical epithelium to produce abundant thin, watery mucus with a high water content (~98%), low cellularity, and parallel glycoprotein fiber arrangement ('ferning' pattern on dried slides). Spinnbarkeit (stretchability to >10 cm threads) is maximal at ovulation. This facilitates sperm penetration by creating channels along aligned mucin fibers. (II) TRUE — Progesterone transforms cervical mucus into a thick, viscous, cellular material with low water content (~90%), dense glycoprotein network, and high leukocyte content. This forms the cervical mucus plug that blocks sperm entry and protects the uterus from ascending infection. This is the basis of the progesterone-only contraceptive pill's mechanism. (III) TRUE — The endocervical crypts (glandular invaginations of the cervical canal) serve as sperm reservoirs. Sperm entering the crypts are released gradually over several days, maintaining a sustained supply of capacitating sperm to the upper tract. This is why the fertile window extends to approximately 5 days before ovulation. The crypts provide a favorable environment (nutrients, appropriate pH) that prolongs sperm viability. (IV) FALSE — Cervical mucus has significant antimicrobial properties. It contains lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, and defensins. The mucus glycoprotein network physically traps bacteria and abnormal sperm. The pH of cervical mucus (~7.0-8.5 at ovulation) is selectively permissive for motile sperm while inhibiting bacterial growth. The cervical mucus plug is a critical component of innate immune defense protecting the uterine cavity.",

        "Human females are unique in that they never experience follicular depletion",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Human menopause and its extended post-reproductive lifespan is an evolutionary puzzle: (1) The puzzle: Most mammals remain fertile until near the end of their lifespan. Human females are unusual in having a post-reproductive lifespan that can exceed 30+ years — representing a substantial portion of total lifespan. Only a few other species (some toothed whales — orcas, short-finned pilot whales, belugas, narwhals) show comparable post-reproductive lifespans. (2) Grandmother hypothesis: Proposed by Kristen Hawkes and others, this hypothesis suggests that post-menopausal women increase their inclusive fitness (gene transmission) by providing food, childcare, and knowledge to their daughters' offspring. Grandmothering may increase grandchild survival rates sufficiently to offset the fitness cost of ceasing reproduction. Data from historical human populations (Finland, Gambia) show that the presence of a maternal grandmother improves grandchild survival. (3) Mother hypothesis: An alternative/complementary explanation — the increasing risk of maternal mortality and chromosomal abnormalities with advanced maternal age means that ceasing reproduction allows mothers to invest in existing offspring rather than risking death during a late pregnancy. (4) Reproductive conflict hypothesis: In species with female philopatry, older females face increasing genetic relatedness asymmetry with offspring of younger group members, making helping (grandmothering) more fitness-beneficial than competing reproductively. (5) Mechanism: Menopause is caused by exhaustion of the ovarian follicle pool (fixed at birth, declining through atresia). The rate of follicle depletion accelerates after age ~37-38 when the pool drops below approximately 25,000.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Traumatic insemination is one of the most extreme reproductive strategies in the animal kingdom: (1) Mechanism: The male bed bug possesses a sclerotized, sickle-shaped intromittent organ (paramere) that pierces the female's abdominal integument at a specialized region called the spermalege (ectospermalege on the external surface, mesospermalege internally). Sperm are injected directly into the hemocoel (body cavity filled with hemolymph). (2) Sperm migration: Ejaculated sperm swim through the hemolymph, eventually reaching the ovaries where they penetrate the ovarian wall and fertilize developing oocytes. In some species, sperm first accumulate in a specialized organ (mesospermalege/sperm conceptacle) before migrating to the reproductive tract. (3) Female counter-adaptation: The spermalege represents a female counter-adaptation — it contains immune cells (hemocytes) and has a thickened cuticle that reduces wound damage and infection risk. The mesospermalege may filter and digest excess sperm, reducing the fitness costs of mating. (4) Sexual conflict: Traumatic insemination is a prime example of sexually antagonistic coevolution. Males benefit from bypassing female control of mating (cryptic female choice). Females suffer fitness costs from wound damage, infection risk, and loss of reproductive control. (5) Multiple species: Besides bed bugs, traumatic insemination occurs in some other hemipterans (Nabidae, Anthocoridae), strepsipterans, and even some nematodes and mollusks.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data illustrate the two major waves of epigenetic reprogramming during mammalian reproduction, one of the most remarkable features of developmental biology: (1) First wave — post-fertilization: After fertilization, both parental genomes undergo dramatic demethylation, but with different kinetics. The paternal genome is rapidly and actively demethylated (80-85% to 30% by 12 hours) through TET3-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, followed by base excision repair. The maternal genome is passively demethylated (40-50% to 45% to 20-25% at blastocyst) through dilution during DNA replication without maintenance methylation (DNMT1 is excluded from the nucleus). (2) Imprint protection: Critically, imprinted genes (which carry parent-of-origin-specific methylation marks) are protected from this first wave of demethylation. This protection is mediated by DPPA3/Stella (binds H3K9me2 to protect maternal genome marks) and ZFP57/TRIM28 complex (recognizes and maintains methylation at imprint control regions). (3) Second wave — primordial germ cells: When primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate to the genital ridges (E11.5-13.5 in mouse), they undergo a second, more thorough wave of demethylation that uniquely erases even the protected genomic imprints (5-10% global methylation). This ensures that new sex-specific imprints can be established during gametogenesis. (4) Imprint re-establishment: New imprints are established during gametogenesis — paternal imprints during spermatogenesis (by DNMT3A with cofactor DNMT3L) and maternal imprints during oocyte growth (also DNMT3A/DNMT3L). (5) Transposon control: Transposon methylation is partially reduced during both waves but is rapidly re-established, primarily through the piRNA pathway in germ cells, to prevent transposon mobilization.",

      "explanation": "The mechanism of levonorgestrel (LNG) emergency contraception has been extensively studied and clarified: (1) Primary mechanism — ovulation inhibition: When taken before the LH surge, LNG at high doses (1.5 mg) disrupts the LH surge, delaying or preventing ovulation. This is its primary and best-supported mechanism. Studies show that LNG is highly effective when taken before ovulation (preventing 80-90% of expected pregnancies) but ineffective when taken after ovulation has occurred (effectiveness drops to near zero). (2) Evidence against post-fertilization effects: Multiple studies have demonstrated that LNG does NOT prevent implantation of a fertilized embryo. In vitro studies show LNG does not impair embryo development or attachment to endometrial cells. In vivo studies in monkeys and rats show LNG given after fertilization does not reduce pregnancy rates. Endometrial biopsies from LNG-treated women show no histological changes incompatible with implantation. (3) Secondary mechanism: LNG may alter cervical mucus viscosity, impeding sperm transport, though this is less well-documented. (4) Timing dependence: Effectiveness decreases with time after unprotected intercourse — 95% within 24 hours, 85% at 24-48 hours, 58% at 48-72 hours — consistent with the ovulation inhibition mechanism (the closer to ovulation, the harder to suppress the LH surge). (5) Distinction from mifepristone: The anti-progestin mifepristone (RU-486) has a different mechanism and is used for medical abortion, not to be confused with LNG emergency contraception.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Monotremes represent the most basal extant mammalian lineage and retain ancestral reptilian reproductive features while possessing the defining mammalian trait of lactation: (1) Oviparity: Monotremes are the only extant egg-laying mammals. The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) lays 1-3 small (15-17 mm), leathery-shelled eggs. Echidnas (Tachyglossus, Zaglossus) lay a single egg into a temporary pouch (incubatorium). Eggs contain yolk (meroblastic cleavage, like reptiles) and are incubated for approximately 10 days (platypus) or 10 days (echidna). (2) Unique lactation: Monotremes lack true nipples. Instead, milk is secreted from modified apocrine sweat glands (mammary glands) onto specialized skin patches (areolae or milk patches). The hatchling laps milk directly from the mother's fur/skin. Monotreme milk composition changes during lactation to meet the hatchling's developmental needs. (3) Reproductive tract: Females have two ovaries (only the left is functional in the platypus) and separate uteri that open into a urogenital sinus (no separate vaginal opening). Males have testes that remain intra-abdominal and a bifurcated penis. (4) Sex determination: Remarkably, the platypus has 10 sex chromosomes (5X and 5Y in males, 10X in females), with the sex-determining chain resembling both mammalian (X homology) and avian (DMRT1-containing chromosome) systems. (5) Evolutionary significance: Monotremes diverged from therian mammals approximately 166-220 million years ago, retaining reptilian oviparity while independently evolving lactation, endothermy, and fur.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Intercellular bridges are a fundamental feature of spermatogenesis with critical functional importance: (1) Formation: During the mitotic divisions of spermatogonia and all subsequent divisions through meiosis, cytokinesis is incomplete — the cleavage furrow constricts but does not fully divide, leaving stable intercellular bridges (cytoplasmic bridges) of approximately 1-3 micrometers diameter. This creates interconnected clones of developing germ cells: one spermatogonium gives rise to a syncytium of 2-128 connected cells (depending on the number of mitotic divisions before meiosis). (2) Haploid gene product sharing: After meiosis I and II, spermatids are haploid — each contains either an X or Y chromosome (and random assortments of autosomes). Without intercellular bridges, X-bearing and Y-bearing spermatids would have different gene expression profiles, potentially leading to functional differences. The bridges allow free diffusion of mRNAs and proteins between connected spermatids, effectively creating a diploid gene expression environment within a haploid cell context. This ensures equivalent differentiation of all spermatids regardless of their haploid genotype. (3) Evidence: Mutations in TEX14 (a protein essential for intercellular bridge formation) in mice result in complete loss of bridges, failure of spermatogenesis beyond the spermatocyte stage, and male infertility. (4) Synchronization: Bridges also synchronize the development of connected germ cells, ensuring coordinated progression through spermatogenesis.

HLA-G binds inhibitory receptors (ILT-2, ILT-4, KIR2DL4) on NK cells, T cells, and macrophages, actively suppressing cytotoxicity. (2) Regulatory T cells: Decidual Tregs (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) expand during pregnancy, particularly at the maternal-fetal interface. They suppress effector T cell responses to paternal antigens. Depletion of Tregs in mice causes fetal resorption. Seminal plasma exposure before conception primes Treg expansion. (3) Progesterone: This is produced in large amounts during pregnancy and has broad immunosuppressive effects — it shifts the maternal immune response from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) toward Th2 (anti-inflammatory), inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity, promotes Treg development, and induces progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF). (4) IDO: Trophoblast and decidual cells express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which catabolizes tryptophan. Local tryptophan depletion suppresses T cell proliferation (T cells are particularly sensitive to tryptophan deficiency). IDO inhibition in pregnant mice causes T cell-mediated fetal rejection. (5) Complement regulation: Trophoblasts express complement regulatory proteins (DAF/CD55, MCP/CD46, CD59) that prevent complement-mediated attack.

The rate of follicle loss accelerates after age 37-38 when the pool drops below approximately 25,000. (2) Qualitative decline — aneuploidy: Aneuploidy rates increase dramatically from 22% at 25-29 to 85% at 43+. The primary mechanism is age-related deterioration of the cohesin protein complex that holds sister chromatids and homologous chromosome pairs together during the decades-long meiotic arrest. As cohesin degrades, chromosomes are more likely to mis-segregate during meiosis I (non-disjunction). Additionally, meiotic spindle assembly becomes less reliable, and the spindle assembly checkpoint becomes less stringent. (3) Live birth rate: Declines from 45% to 3%, reflecting both fewer oocytes and higher aneuploidy. Most aneuploid embryos either fail to implant or miscarry.

This depolarization is caused by an influx of sodium ions through channels that open upon sperm-egg fusion. (2) Why it works: Sperm can only fuse with membranes at a negative resting potential. The positive membrane potential of the depolarized egg repels or prevents fusion of additional sperm. This was elegantly demonstrated by voltage clamp experiments: artificially maintaining the egg at negative potential allowed polyspermy, while maintaining positive potential blocked all fertilization. (3) Speed: This electrical change is the fastest known block to polyspermy — it occurs within seconds, far faster than the slow block (cortical reaction, which takes 30-60 seconds to begin). (4) Duration: The fast block is transient — the membrane potential returns to normal (re-polarizes) within minutes. By this time, the slow block (cortical reaction modifying the vitelline layer into the fertilization envelope) has been established. (5) Taxonomic distribution: The fast electrical block is well-characterized in sea urchins and some amphibians but appears to be absent or less important in mammals, where the slow block (zona reaction) is the primary polyspermy defense. (6) The cortical reaction (option A) is the slow block, not the fast block.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "GDNF is the critical survival and self-renewal factor for spermatogonial stem cells: (1) GDNF-GFRalpha1/RET signaling: GDNF is secreted by Sertoli cells (stimulated by FSH) and binds to a receptor complex on SSCs consisting of GFRalpha1 (the GDNF family receptor alpha 1, a GPI-anchored co-receptor) and RET (a receptor tyrosine kinase). This activates intracellular signaling cascades including PI3K/AKT, SRC family kinases, and RAS/ERK pathways that promote SSC self-renewal and prevent differentiation. (2) Genetic evidence: GDNF heterozygous knockout mice show progressive depletion of SSCs leading to Sertoli cell-only syndrome. GDNF overexpression (transgenic) causes accumulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia (clusters of SSCs that fail to differentiate), eventually leading to germ cell tumors. GFRalpha1 knockout is neonatal lethal, but conditional studies confirm SSC loss. (3) Niche concept: SSCs reside in a specialized niche at the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules, preferentially near blood vessels and interstitial tissue. The niche provides GDNF (from Sertoli cells), FGF2 (from Sertoli and peritubular cells), and CXCL12 (from Sertoli cells), which together maintain the stem cell pool. (4) Balance: The ratio of GDNF (self-renewal) to other factors like retinoic acid (differentiation) determines whether SSCs self-renew or differentiate into committed progenitors. (5) Clinical relevance: Understanding SSC biology enables spermatogonial stem cell transplantation — a technique where SSCs from a donor are transplanted into a recipient testis to restore fertility, with applications in cancer patients whose SSCs are damaged by chemotherapy.",

        "False"

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "Analysis of each statement: (I) TRUE — Decidualization transforms spindle-shaped endometrial stromal fibroblasts into large, rounded, epithelioid decidual cells packed with glycogen and lipid droplets. These cells secrete prolactin, IGFBP-1, and other factors that create a nutritive and immunologically permissive environment for the implanting embryo. Before the placental circulation is fully established (first 10-12 weeks), the decidua provides histotrophic nutrition through glandular secretions. (II) TRUE — Humans (and some other primates and the elephant shrew) are unusual in that decidualization begins spontaneously during the secretory phase of each menstrual cycle, under the influence of progesterone and cAMP signaling, regardless of whether an embryo is present. This is called 'spontaneous decidualization' and is unique among mammals — in most species, decidualization only occurs in response to embryo implantation signals (induced decidualization). If pregnancy does not occur, the decidualized endometrium is shed during menstruation. (III) TRUE — Decidual NK cells (dNK, CD56bright CD16-) constitute 50-70% of immune cells at the implantation site in the first trimester. Unlike peripheral blood NK cells (CD56dim CD16+), dNK cells are poorly cytotoxic and instead produce angiogenic factors (VEGF, PlGF), cytokines (IL-8, IP-10), and matrix metalloproteinases that promote spiral artery remodeling — converting small, muscular spiral arteries into large, flaccid, low-resistance vessels essential for adequate placental blood flow. dNK cells also regulate trophoblast invasion depth. (IV) FALSE — This directly contradicts statement II. Decidualization in humans occurs spontaneously each cycle, not exclusively in response to embryo presence. This is the basis for menstruation — when pregnancy does not occur, progesterone withdrawal triggers shedding of the decidualized endometrium.",

      "options": [
        "Males produce eggs internally and self-fertilize them",
        "The male possesses a specialized brood pouch with a vascularized inner lining that provides gas exchange, osmoregulation, and nutrient transfer to developing embryos — functionally analogous to a uterus",

        "Males swallow fertilized eggs and incubate them in their stomachs"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Male pregnancy in seahorses (family Syngnathidae, which includes seahorses, pipefish, and sea dragons) is one of the most remarkable reproductive adaptations in vertebrates: (1) Brood pouch: The male seahorse has a specialized brood pouch (marsupium) on the ventral surface of the trunk/tail. The female deposits eggs into the male's pouch through an ovipositor during an elaborate courtship dance. The male then fertilizes the eggs within the pouch. (2) Physiological support: The brood pouch is not merely a passive container. Its inner epithelium is highly vascularized and provides: (a) Gas exchange — oxygen delivery and CO2 removal via dense capillary networks; (b) Osmoregulation — the pouch fluid transitions from seawater-like to body fluid-like composition, creating a controlled environment; (c) Nutrient transfer — lipids, calcium, and other nutrients are transferred from the male to developing embryos through the pouch epithelium; (d) Waste removal — metabolic waste products are cleared through the vascular supply. (3) Hormonal control: Male pregnancy involves hormonal changes including elevated prolactin (promoting pouch function, similar to its role in mammalian lactation) and progesterone-like steroids. Brood pouch development is testosterone-dependent. (4) Parturition: Males undergo labor contractions (muscular contractions of the pouch wall) to expel fully developed miniature seahorses. Brooding duration varies by species (2-4 weeks). (5) Evolutionary context: Male pregnancy evolved once in the Syngnathidae family. It represents an extreme form of paternal investment, with the male providing both protection and physiological support comparable to mammalian gestation.",

        "The baculum is found only in primates and functions to increase ejaculation volume",
        "The baculum is found in most mammalian orders (including carnivores, rodents, bats, and some primates) and is thought to function in maintaining penile rigidity during prolonged intromission in species with extended copulation times, potentially reducing reliance on vascular erection alone",
        "The baculum is present in all mammals without exception",
        "The baculum functions exclusively as a display structure for female mate choice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The baculum (os penis) is one of the most variable bones in the mammalian skeleton and has attracted considerable evolutionary interest: (1) Distribution: The baculum is present in most mammalian orders including Carnivora (walrus has the largest, up to 60 cm), Rodentia, Chiroptera (bats), Insectivora, and some Primates (not in humans, spider monkeys, or marmosets). Its size, shape, and complexity vary enormously between species. (2) Prolonged intromission hypothesis: The most widely supported hypothesis proposes that the baculum provides mechanical support for penile rigidity during copulation, particularly important in species with prolonged intromission. Without a baculum, sustained erection depends entirely on vascular hydraulics (blood pressure in the corpus cavernosum). The baculum supplements this, allowing extended copulation in species where prolonged intromission is important for reproductive success. (3) Induced ovulation: Many bacula-bearing species are induced ovulators (e.g., cats, ferrets), where vaginal stimulation during copulation triggers ovulation. Prolonged intromission facilitated by the baculum may enhance the ovulatory stimulus. (4) Sperm competition: Baculum size correlates with mating system across primates — species with high sperm competition (multi-male mating) tend to have larger bacula. The baculum may help displace rival males' sperm or ensure effective sperm deposition. (5) Loss in humans: The loss of the baculum in humans correlates with the evolution of short intromission time relative to many other mammals, monogamous/pair-bonding tendency (reducing sperm competition pressure), and reliance on vascular erection alone. (6) Evolutionary dynamics: Baculum morphology evolves rapidly, likely driven by sexual selection, making it useful for species identification in some mammalian groups.",

        "Mammals use an identical fertilization envelope mechanism as sea urchins",
        "In mammals, the cortical reaction releases ovastacin (a zinc-dependent metalloprotease) from cortical granules, which cleaves ZP2 protein, converting the zona pellucida from a sperm-binding to non-binding state — unlike sea urchins, which form a physical fertilization envelope by cross-linking the vitelline layer",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The mammalian slow block (zona reaction) differs fundamentally from the sea urchin slow block in molecular mechanism: (1) Mammalian mechanism: Upon sperm-egg fusion, a calcium wave propagates through the oocyte cytoplasm. Calcium oscillations (triggered by sperm-delivered PLCzeta) activate cortical granule exocytosis. Cortical granules release their contents into the perivitelline space, including ovastacin (also called astacin-like metalloendopeptidase, encoded by ASTL gene). Ovastacin specifically cleaves ZP2 at a single site (Leu168-Ala169 in mouse), converting it from a sperm-binding form to a cleaved, non-binding form. This 'zona hardening' prevents additional sperm from binding and penetrating. (2) Evidence: ZP2 cleavage-resistant mutant mice (ZP2Mut) show polyspermy, directly demonstrating that ZP2 cleavage is the essential molecular event. Ovastacin knockout mice also show delayed zona hardening. (3) Sea urchin mechanism: In contrast, sea urchins use a fundamentally different slow block. Cortical granules release: (a) a protease that separates the vitelline layer from the egg surface; (b) mucopolysaccharides that create osmotic pressure, drawing water into the perivitelline space and lifting the vitelline layer; (c) peroxidase that cross-links tyrosine residues in the vitelline layer, hardening it into the rigid fertilization envelope. This physical elevation and hardening creates an impenetrable barrier. (4) Key difference: Mammals modify the molecular recognition between sperm and zona (biochemical change to ZP2), while sea urchins create a new physical barrier (fertilization envelope). (5) No fast block in mammals: Unlike sea urchins, mammals lack the fast electrical block. The zona reaction is therefore the primary polyspermy defense in mammals.",

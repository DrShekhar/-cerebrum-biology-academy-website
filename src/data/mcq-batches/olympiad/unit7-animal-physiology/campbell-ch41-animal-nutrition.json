      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In ruminants (cattle, sheep, deer), ingested plant material first enters the rumen, the largest chamber, where symbiotic microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, fungi) ferment cellulose into volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Material is then regurgitated for further chewing (rumination) and re-swallowed. The reticulum acts as a sorting chamber, directing small particles to the omasum while returning larger particles to the rumen. The omasum absorbs water and VFAs, concentrating the digesta. Finally, the abomasum functions as the true stomach, secreting HCl and pepsin for enzymatic digestion, equivalent to the stomach of monogastric animals. Option B incorrectly places the reticulum first and reverses the omasum and abomasum. Options C and D scramble the correct order entirely.",

        "Enterokinase secreted by duodenal enterocytes",
        "Bile salts from the liver that emulsify the zymogen's lipid coating",

        "Hydrochloric acid (pH < 2) secreted by parietal cells, which causes autocatalytic cleavage of the pepsinogen pro-peptide"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pepsinogen activation requires the acidic environment (pH 1.5-2.0) created by HCl secreted by parietal (oxyntic) cells of the gastric glands. At low pH, the protonation of key residues in pepsinogen induces a conformational change that exposes the active site and leads to autocatalytic cleavage of the 44-amino-acid N-terminal pro-peptide. Once active pepsin is formed, it can also activate additional pepsinogen molecules (autocatalytic cascade), amplifying the process. Option A is incorrect because enterokinase (enteropeptidase) activates trypsinogen in the duodenum, not pepsinogen in the stomach. Option C is incorrect because bile salts function in lipid emulsification in the duodenum. Option D is incorrect because trypsin operates in the small intestine and does not enter the stomach.",

      "options": [
        "Fiber and water in the duodenum; CCK stimulates large intestinal motility and water absorption",
        "Carbohydrates in the duodenum; CCK stimulates salivary amylase secretion and gastric motility",

        "Gastric acid in the duodenum; CCK stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "CCK release is primarily triggered by the presence of fatty acids and amino acids (products of lipid and protein digestion) in the duodenum. CCK has three major effects: (1) stimulation of gallbladder contraction to release bile into the duodenum for fat emulsification; (2) stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells to secrete digestive enzymes (lipase, protease, amylase); and (3) inhibition of gastric emptying via the enterogastric reflex, slowing the delivery of chyme to allow adequate duodenal processing time. CCK also promotes satiety through vagal afferents to the brain. Option A incorrectly identifies the stimulus (carbohydrates) and effects (salivary and gastric). Option C describes the function of secretin, not CCK. Option D fabricates non-existent functions.",

      "question": "The proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) in parietal cells of the stomach generates an H+ concentration in the gastric lumen that is approximately 3 million times greater than in the blood. Which statement about this process is correct?",
      "options": [
        "Carbonic anhydrase in parietal cells generates H+ from CO2 and H2O, which is then secreted into the lumen by facilitated diffusion",
        "The pump is an example of passive transport because protons move down their concentration gradient into the acidic lumen",
        "The pump generates HCl directly by combining hydrogen and chloride ions within the pump protein before releasing them into the lumen",
        "The pump transports H+ into the lumen in exchange for K+ using ATP hydrolysis, and the Cl- follows through separate chloride channels to form HCl"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The gastric proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) is a P-type ATPase located on the apical (luminal) membrane of parietal cells. It uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump H+ into the gastric lumen in exchange for K+ (antiport), generating the extremely low pH (~1-2) of gastric juice. The H+ is generated intracellularly by carbonic anhydrase: CO2 + H2O \u2192 H2CO3 \u2192 H+ + HCO3-. The H+ is pumped out while HCO3- exits the basolateral side in exchange for Cl- (the 'alkaline tide'). Cl- enters the cell from blood via the basolateral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger and exits into the lumen through apical chloride channels, combining with H+ to form HCl. Option A is incorrect because pumping H+ against a 3-million-fold gradient is active transport. Option C incorrectly describes direct HCl formation within the pump. Option D incorrectly calls the secretion facilitated diffusion.",

        "B12 is synthesized by colonic bacteria and absorbed in the large intestine via sodium-dependent transporters"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Vitamin B12 absorption is a multi-step process requiring several binding proteins. In the mouth, B12 binds to haptocorrin (R-protein) in saliva, which protects it from gastric acid. In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade R-protein, releasing B12, which then binds intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by gastric parietal cells. The IF-B12 complex travels to the terminal ileum, where it binds to cubilin receptors on enterocytes and is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the cell, B12 is released from IF and transferred to transcobalamin II for transport in the blood. Absence of IF (as in pernicious anemia or after gastrectomy) causes B12 malabsorption. Option B is incorrect because passive diffusion is insufficient for B12 absorption. Option C incorrectly places IF binding in the mouth and absorption in the stomach. Option D is partially true about synthesis but wrong about absorption site.",

        "Commensalism, because only the bacteria benefit while the insect is unaffected"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a classic example of nutritional mutualism. Many herbivorous insects (aphids with Buchnera, tsetse flies with Wigglesworthia) harbor obligate endosymbiotic bacteria in specialized cells called bacteriocytes. The bacteria synthesize essential amino acids, vitamins, and other nutrients that are deficient in the insect's restricted diet (plant sap, blood). In return, the bacteria receive a protected intracellular environment, carbon sources, and other metabolic substrates from the host. Neither partner can survive independently in most cases, indicating an obligate mutualism evolved over millions of years, often with extensive genome reduction in the bacteria. Option A mischaracterizes the mutually beneficial relationship. Option C incorrectly states the insect is unaffected; removal of symbionts causes nutritional deficiency and death. Option D incorrectly describes the relationship as competitive.",

      "options": [
        "Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides to monoglycerides and fatty acids, which form mixed micelles with bile salts; these diffuse to the brush border where lipid components are absorbed by enterocytes, re-esterified to triglycerides in the smooth ER, packaged into chylomicrons, and secreted into lacteals",
        "Bile salts directly transport intact fat molecules across enterocyte membranes via active transport pumps",
        "Short-chain and long-chain fatty acids are both absorbed into portal blood capillaries and transported directly to the liver bound to albumin",
        "Triglycerides are absorbed intact through paracellular pathways between enterocytes and packaged into chylomicrons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Fat absorption is a complex process requiring both mechanical and chemical emulsification. Bile salts emulsify large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for pancreatic lipase (with colipase as cofactor) to hydrolyze triglycerides into 2-monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids. These products, along with bile salts, form mixed micelles (~4-7 nm) that shuttle lipids through the unstirred water layer to the brush border. At the enterocyte surface, lipid components leave the micelle and are absorbed (partly by passive diffusion, partly via fatty acid transport proteins). Inside the enterocyte, fatty acids and monoglycerides are re-esterified to triglycerides in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, packaged with cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoprotein B-48 into chylomicrons, and secreted into lacteals (lymphatic capillaries). Option A is incorrect because triglycerides must be hydrolyzed. Option C mischaracterizes bile salt function. Option D is only partially correct for short-chain fatty acids.",

        "Local enteric reflexes in the stomach wall detect the sight and smell of food"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The cephalic phase accounts for approximately 30% of total gastric acid secretion and is triggered by the sight, smell, taste, or thought of food. Sensory stimuli from the cerebral cortex and appetite centers in the hypothalamus stimulate the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Vagal efferents (parasympathetic fibers) travel to the stomach via the vagus nerve (CN X) and: (1) directly stimulate parietal cells to secrete HCl via acetylcholine acting on M3 muscarinic receptors; (2) directly stimulate chief cells to secrete pepsinogen; (3) stimulate G-cells in the gastric antrum to release gastrin, which further stimulates acid secretion; and (4) stimulate enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells to release histamine, a potent stimulator of parietal cells. Option A is incorrect because sympathetic stimulation actually inhibits gastric secretion. Option C involves the wrong nerve. Option D incorrectly describes enteric reflexes as detecting distant stimuli.",

      "options": [
        "Ruminants absorb intact cellulose fibers and process them in the liver through specialized hepatic enzymes",

        "Ruminants produce cellulase, a cellulose-degrading enzyme, in their salivary glands"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "No vertebrate produces endogenous cellulase. Ruminants and other herbivores that extract energy from cellulose do so through an obligate partnership with symbiotic microorganisms. In the rumen, a diverse community of anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus), protozoa, and anaerobic fungi produces cellulases and hemicellulases that hydrolyze the beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds linking glucose monomers in cellulose. The released glucose is then fermented anaerobically by these microorganisms to volatile fatty acids (VFAs: acetate, propionate, butyrate), which are absorbed across the rumen wall and serve as the ruminant's primary energy source (providing 60-80% of total energy). The microorganisms themselves are eventually digested in the abomasum, providing additional protein. Option A is incorrect because ruminants lack endogenous cellulase. Option C is incorrect because acid alone cannot efficiently break cellulose. Option D is biologically impossible.",

      "options": [
        "Bile salts synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes are secreted into bile, stored in the gallbladder, released into the duodenum, actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), and returned to the liver via the portal vein for resecretion",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Enterohepatic circulation recycles ~95% of bile salts 6-8 times per day. Hepatocytes synthesize primary bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid) from cholesterol via 7-alpha-hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme). These are conjugated with glycine or taurine, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the duodenum upon CCK stimulation. After participating in fat emulsification and absorption throughout the small intestine, bile salts are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT/IBAT). They enter the portal circulation bound to albumin, are extracted by hepatocytes, and rescreted into bile. Only ~5% of the bile salt pool is lost in feces daily and must be replaced by new synthesis. Option A incorrectly states bile salts are made in the gallbladder and all excreted. Option C incorrectly claims passive absorption everywhere and lymphatic transport.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "After total gastrectomy, patients lose both parietal cells (which produce HCl and intrinsic factor) and chief cells (which produce pepsin). This leads to: (1) Vitamin B12 deficiency because intrinsic factor is essential for B12 absorption in the ileum; (2) Iron deficiency because gastric acid is needed to reduce ferric iron (Fe3+) to the absorbable ferrous form (Fe2+) and to solubilize dietary iron; (3) Calcium malabsorption because gastric acid helps solubilize calcium salts, making calcium ions available for absorption. However, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is readily absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum by the SVCT1 transporter, and its absorption does not depend on gastric acid or any gastric factor. While the stomach does secrete some ascorbate, this is not required for systemic vitamin C status. Therefore, vitamin C deficiency is not a characteristic consequence of gastrectomy.",

      "explanation": "SGLT1 (sodium-glucose linked transporter 1) is a secondary active transporter on the apical (luminal) membrane of enterocytes. It couples the downhill movement of Na+ (maintained by the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase) with the uphill transport of glucose (2 Na+ per 1 glucose molecule), allowing glucose absorption even when luminal glucose concentration is lower than intracellular concentration. Once inside the cell, glucose exits via GLUT2 on the basolateral membrane, a facilitated diffusion transporter that allows glucose to move down its concentration gradient into the interstitial fluid and then into blood. Option B is incorrect because neither transporter uses ATP directly; SGLT1 uses secondary active transport (indirect ATP use via Na+/K+-ATPase). Option C reverses the mechanisms.

When fat stores are adequate, leptin acts on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to: (1) inhibit orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) NPY/AgRP neurons, reducing hunger signals; (2) stimulate anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) POMC/CART neurons, which produce alpha-MSH that acts on MC4 receptors to suppress appetite; and (3) increase energy expenditure through sympathetic activation of thermogenesis. In obesity, leptin resistance can develop where the brain becomes less responsive to leptin despite high circulating levels.

These endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase) and exopeptidases (carboxypeptidase A and B) further digest polypeptides to oligopeptides. At the brush border, membrane-bound aminopeptidases and dipeptidases complete hydrolysis to free amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides, which are absorbed.

      "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) serves as an essential cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, the enzymes that hydroxylate proline and lysine residues in procollagen chains. Hydroxyproline residues are critical for forming hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen triple helix structure. Without adequate vitamin C, underhydroxylated collagen cannot form stable triple helices, is poorly secreted, and is rapidly degraded. Since collagen is the most abundant protein in the body (constituting ~30% of total protein), providing structural support to skin, blood vessels, bones, tendons, and gums, its deficient production explains the multi-system manifestations of scurvy. Option B is incorrect because vitamin C does not directly cross-link collagen (lysyl oxidase does). Option C is incorrect because elastin synthesis does not require vitamin C. Option D confuses vitamin C with vitamin D's role in calcium metabolism.",

The fundamental principle involves passing a fluid medium (water) through a filtering structure that retains food particles while allowing water to pass. In baleen whales, keratinous baleen plates filter krill and small fish. In flamingos, lamellae in the bill filter algae and small crustaceans. In bivalve mollusks, gill cilia create water currents and trap particles in mucus. In sponges, choanocytes create flow and capture bacteria. The mesh size or pore size of the filter determines the minimum particle size captured. Option A is partially correct for some filter feeders (bivalves, sponges) but not all (baleen whales do not use mucus).

Gastrin acts on CCK-B receptors on parietal cells and ECL cells. S2 is TRUE: Secretin was the first hormone ever discovered (Bayliss and Starling, 1902). S-cells in the duodenal mucosa release secretin when luminal pH drops below ~4.5. Secretin stimulates pancreatic duct cells to secrete HCO3--rich fluid, neutralizing acidic chyme. S3 is TRUE: GIP (also called glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide) is an incretin hormone released by K-cells in the duodenum and jejunum.

S2 is TRUE: In hindgut fermenters, the cecum (and proximal colon) houses anaerobic microorganisms that ferment cellulose to volatile fatty acids, similar to rumen fermentation but occurring after the main absorptive regions of the small intestine.

The volatile fatty acids produced by rumen microbes are absorbed across the rumen wall, and when the microbes themselves are digested in the abomasum and small intestine, their protein and other nutrients are absorbed. In hindgut fermenters like rabbits, cellulose fermentation occurs in the cecum/colon AFTER the small intestine. VFAs are absorbed in the colon, but microbial protein and vitamins largely cannot be absorbed in the colon and are lost in feces (which is why rabbits practice coprophagy).

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Iron absorption is tightly regulated due to iron's toxicity in excess and the lack of a regulated excretory pathway. Dietary non-heme iron is predominantly in the ferric (Fe3+) form, which must first be reduced to the ferrous (Fe2+) form by duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), a ferrireductase on the apical brush border membrane. Fe2+ is then transported into the enterocyte by DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1, also called NRAMP2). Inside the cell, iron can be stored as ferritin (if iron is sufficient) or exported across the basolateral membrane by ferroportin, the only known iron exporter in mammals. Upon export, Fe2+ is oxidized back to Fe3+ by the copper-dependent ferroxidase hephaestin (membrane-bound) or ceruloplasmin (in plasma), and Fe3+ binds transferrin for blood transport. Hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone, regulates iron absorption by promoting ferroportin degradation. Options B, C, and D all contain fundamental errors in the mechanism.",

It consists of four phases, with Phase III being the most recognizable: a band of strong peristaltic contractions that migrates from the stomach through the small intestine to the terminal ileum, sweeping ahead residual food particles, bacteria, dead mucosal cells, and secretions. This 'housekeeping' function prevents bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. The MMC is abolished by feeding (when segmentation and peristalsis take over for digestion) and is regulated by motilin and the enteric nervous system.

When the food bolus enters the stomach, amylase continues to work in the interior of the bolus before gastric acid penetrates and lowers the pH below 4, which denatures the enzyme. This can account for significant starch digestion during the meal. S2 is TRUE: Pancreatic alpha-amylase, secreted by acinar cells, is the major enzyme for luminal starch digestion. Like salivary amylase, it cleaves internal alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds, but at its optimal pH of ~7.5. The products are the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, and alpha-limit dextrins (short-branched oligosaccharides). S3 is TRUE: These brush border enzymes complete carbohydrate digestion. Maltase cleaves maltose to two glucose molecules. Sucrase cleaves sucrose to glucose and fructose. Lactase cleaves lactose to glucose and galactose. S4 is FALSE: Cellulose contains beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds, which human amylase cannot cleave (amylase is specific for alpha bonds).

If ghrelin levels remain persistently elevated at 800 pg/mL despite eating, the patient lacks the normal postprandial ghrelin suppression. Since ghrelin is the primary orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) hormone, persistent high levels would continuously stimulate NPY/AgRP neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, maintaining hunger signals even after adequate food intake. This would result in persistent hunger, difficulty achieving satiety, and likely overeating, contributing to weight gain and obesity.

The protein deficiency leads to reduced hepatic synthesis of plasma albumin, decreasing blood colloid osmotic pressure and causing fluid to shift from capillaries to interstitial spaces (edema), particularly in the abdomen (ascites), legs, and face. Other signs include fatty liver (impaired lipoprotein synthesis), skin lesions, and hair discoloration. Marasmus results from chronic total caloric and protein deficiency. The body catabolizes both fat stores and muscle protein for energy, leading to severe wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, skeletal appearance, and generalized emaciation without edema (because protein deficiency is proportional to overall caloric deficit). Option A reverses the two conditions. Option C ignores the distinctive presentation differences. Option D is incorrect as both can occur at various ages.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Gastric surface mucous cells (not goblet cells, which are in the intestine, but the concept is correct for gastric mucous cells) secrete a 0.2-0.6 mm thick mucus layer containing entrapped HCO3-. This creates a pH gradient from the hostile luminal pH of 1-2 to a near-neutral pH of 6-7 at the epithelial surface, protecting the cells from acid and pepsin. S2 is TRUE: Prostaglandins, particularly PGE2 and PGI2, are critical cytoprotective mediators. They stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintain mucosal blood flow, promote epithelial cell proliferation, and inhibit acid secretion. These are produced constitutively by COX-1 in the gastric mucosa. S3 is FALSE: NSAIDs do the opposite. They INHIBIT cyclooxygenase (particularly COX-1), reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby compromising mucosal defense. This is why chronic NSAID use is a major risk factor for peptic ulcers and gastric bleeding. S4 is TRUE: H. pylori produces large amounts of urease, converting urea to ammonia and CO2. The ammonia neutralizes gastric acid in the bacterium's immediate microenvironment, allowing survival and colonization of the gastric mucosa. This chronic infection can cause gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer.",

Northern European and West African pastoral adults maintain high activity (~30-35 U/g) while East Asian adults show severe decline (~4 U/g). This reflects lactase persistence, a genetically determined trait that evolved convergently in populations with a long history of dairy farming. The ancestral mammalian condition is lactase non-persistence (downregulation after weaning), seen in East Asian adults. Independent mutations in the cis-regulatory enhancer region upstream of the LCT gene (e.g., -13910*T in Europeans, -14010*C in East Africans) prevent the normal developmental downregulation, maintaining lactase production into adulthood. This is a classic example of gene-culture coevolution. Option A ignores the genetic basis. Option C is incorrect because the decline is developmental downregulation, not enzyme destruction. Option D contradicts the well-documented genetic differences.",

In protozoans (e.g., Paramecium, Amoeba), food vacuoles formed by phagocytosis or cytostome ingestion fuse with lysosomes for enzymatic digestion.

Its primary mechanism is to bind to ferroportin, the sole known iron exporter on cell membranes. When hepcidin binds ferroportin, it triggers phosphorylation, ubiquitination, internalization, and lysosomal degradation of the transporter. This prevents iron export from: (1) duodenal enterocytes (blocking dietary iron absorption), (2) hepatocytes (blocking iron release from stores), and (3) reticuloendothelial macrophages (blocking iron recycling from senescent red blood cells). The net effect is reduced serum iron. Hepcidin production increases when iron stores are adequate (via the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway sensing liver iron) and during inflammation (via IL-6-JAK-STAT3 pathway), and decreases during iron deficiency, hypoxia, and increased erythropoiesis.

These activated PSCs produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I, III, fibronectin) and matrix metalloproteinases, leading to progressive pancreatic fibrosis. This fibrosis destroys both exocrine tissue (causing maldigestion) and endocrine islets (causing diabetes). PSCs also play a role in pancreatic cancer by creating the dense desmoplastic stroma. Option A describes acinar cell autoactivation. Option C describes islet cells. Option D describes ductal epithelial cells.",

These two populations integrate peripheral signals and provide opposing control. S2 is TRUE: PYY3-36 is released postprandially from intestinal L-cells and acts on Y2 receptors on NPY/AgRP neurons, inhibiting them and thereby reducing appetite.

Importantly, the PepT1 (SLC15A1) transporter absorbs di- and tripeptides using a proton gradient, which is very efficient and accounts for a significant fraction of total amino acid absorption. On the basolateral side, amino acids exit via facilitated diffusion through various transporters.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The dental formula and jaw mechanics described are classic herbivore features. Large, flat-topped molars with selenodont or lophodont ridges provide grinding surfaces for breaking down fibrous plant material (cellulose, lignin). The lateral (side-to-side) jaw movement is essential for a grinding motion that processes tough plant fibers, in contrast to the up-and-down (orthal) jaw movement of carnivores. The diastema (gap between incisors and premolars) is characteristic of herbivores and rodents, providing space for the tongue and cheeks to manipulate food within the mouth. Reduced canines are typical because herbivores do not need to pierce or tear prey. Carnivores (Option A) would have sharp carnassial teeth for shearing, large canines, and primarily vertical jaw movement. Omnivores (Option B) typically have more generalized dentition. Insectivores (Option D) typically have sharp-cusped teeth for puncturing exoskeletons.",

      "question": "Trypsin inhibitor proteins are found naturally in raw soybeans and other legumes. What is the physiological consequence of consuming large quantities of raw soybeans?",
      "options": [
        "Impaired protein digestion because trypsin inhibitors block the trypsin-initiated activation cascade of all pancreatic proteases, and the resulting CCK-mediated hyperstimulation of the pancreas can cause pancreatic hypertrophy",
        "No effect because gastric acid destroys all trypsin inhibitors before they reach the duodenum",
        "Enhanced protein digestion due to activation of additional digestive enzymes",
        "Improved fat absorption due to increased bile salt production"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Trypsin inhibitors (Kunitz-type and Bowman-Birk type) in raw soybeans bind to and inactivate trypsin in the small intestine. Since trypsin is required to activate all other pancreatic zymogens (chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidases), its inhibition effectively paralyzes the entire pancreatic protease cascade, severely impairing protein digestion. Additionally, the absence of active trypsin removes the negative feedback on CCK release (trypsin normally degrades CCK-releasing peptide in the duodenum). This causes sustained CCK secretion, continuously stimulating the pancreas to secrete more enzyme, leading to pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which in rodent models can progress to pancreatic neoplasia. Cooking denatures trypsin inhibitors, which is why soybeans must be heat-processed before consumption. Option A is the opposite of reality. Option C is unrelated. Option D is incorrect because trypsin inhibitors are proteins that are partially resistant to gastric digestion.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Riftia pachyptila is one of the most remarkable examples of nutritional symbiosis. Adult tube worms completely lack a mouth, gut, and anus. Instead, they possess a large, specialized organ called the trophosome (constituting up to 50% of body mass) that houses billions of chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacteria. The worm's red plume (branchial structure extending from the tube) absorbs O2, CO2, and H2S from the vent water, which are transported via hemoglobin (which uniquely binds both O2 and H2S on separate binding sites) in the blood to the trophosome. The endosymbiotic bacteria use the energy from oxidizing H2S (H2S + O2 \u2192 SO4^2-) to fix CO2 into organic carbon via the Calvin cycle, sharing these organic molecules with the host worm. Option A is incorrect because Riftia lacks a mouth and gut. Option B is also incorrect for the same reason. Option D is insufficient to support the worm's metabolic needs.",

The Gla residues have two carboxyl groups that can chelate calcium ions (Ca2+), which is essential for these clotting factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces (exposed at sites of vascular injury) and participate in the coagulation cascade. The affected clotting factors are prothrombin (Factor II) and Factors VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z. Warfarin, a widely used anticoagulant, works by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, preventing the recycling of vitamin K and thereby blocking Gla formation.

        "The caterpillar cannot detect nutritional imbalance and eats randomly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data reveal a classic pattern of compensatory feeding. At extreme P:C ratios (1:5 and 5:1), the caterpillar increases total food intake (120 and 110 mg/day) in an attempt to obtain sufficient amounts of the limiting nutrient. However, this overconsumption leads to excess intake of the abundant nutrient, which must be metabolically processed or excreted, reducing assimilation efficiency (45% and 50%). At balanced ratios (1:1), ingestion is lowest (75 mg/day) but assimilation efficiency and growth rate are highest (72% and 22 mg/day), because the nutrient supply matches demand with minimal waste. This nutrient balancing behavior, studied extensively using the Geometric Framework of nutrition by Simpson and Raubenheimer, shows that animals actively regulate intake of multiple nutrients and make feeding decisions that represent compromises when foods are nutritionally imbalanced.",

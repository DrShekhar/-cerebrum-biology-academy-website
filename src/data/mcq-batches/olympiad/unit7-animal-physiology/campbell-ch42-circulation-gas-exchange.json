      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "A prolonged PR interval (>200 ms, normal 120-200 ms) with 1:1 conduction (every P wave followed by a QRS complex) defines first-degree AV block. The delay occurs in the AV node, where conduction is slower than normal but every atrial impulse eventually reaches the ventricles. This is usually benign and often asymptomatic. Option B (atrial fibrillation) would show an irregularly irregular rhythm with no discernible P waves. Option C (ventricular tachycardia) would show wide QRS complexes at a rapid rate. Option D (complete heart block) would show P waves and QRS complexes occurring independently at different rates, with no consistent relationship between them. First-degree AV block is distinguished from second-degree block (some P waves not followed by QRS) and third-degree block (complete dissociation).",

A normal ejection fraction is 55-70%, so this value falls within the normal range. Option A (42%) would indicate mild heart failure (HFrEF is defined as EF < 40%). Option C (72%) would be supranormal, typically seen during exercise. Option D (35%) would indicate significant systolic dysfunction.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Frank-Starling mechanism is an intrinsic property of cardiac muscle that allows the heart to automatically adjust its output to match venous return. When venous return increases, the ventricles fill to a greater end-diastolic volume, stretching the cardiac sarcomeres. Within the physiological range, this stretch increases the overlap between actin and myosin filaments, increases calcium sensitivity of troponin C, and optimizes cross-bridge cycling, producing a more forceful contraction and greater stroke volume. This mechanism operates without neural or hormonal input (it is an intrinsic property of the myocardium). Option A describes chronotropic regulation, not the Starling mechanism. Option C ignores the intrinsic mechanisms. Option D directly contradicts the law. The Starling mechanism ensures that the left and right ventricles maintain equal outputs, preventing pulmonary or systemic congestion.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve means that at any given partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), hemoglobin holds less oxygen (lower percent saturation). This represents decreased affinity and facilitates oxygen unloading at metabolically active tissues. Four major factors cause a rightward shift: (1) increased temperature (active muscles generate heat); (2) decreased pH (active tissues produce CO2 and lactic acid \u2014 the Bohr effect); (3) increased CO2 (directly and through carbamino compound formation); and (4) increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), produced by red blood cells during glycolysis, which binds to deoxyhemoglobin and stabilizes the T-state. These conditions are all characteristic of metabolically active tissues that need oxygen, so the rightward shift is physiologically appropriate. Option A describes a leftward shift.

      "options": [
        "Fish gills have a thicker diffusion barrier that slows oxygen movement, allowing more time for extraction",

        "Fish hemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity than mammalian hemoglobin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The key to fish gill efficiency is countercurrent exchange. Water flows over the gill lamellae in one direction while blood flows through the lamellar capillaries in the opposite direction. This arrangement ensures that blood leaving the lamella (at the water entry point) encounters the highest PO2 in the water (fresh, oxygen-rich water), and blood entering the lamella encounters water that has already lost some oxygen. At every point along the length of the lamella, the PO2 of water exceeds the PO2 of blood, maintaining a constant diffusion gradient. This achieves near-equilibrium extraction (80-90%). If flow were concurrent (same direction), equilibrium would be reached at the midpoint PO2, limiting extraction to ~50%. Option A is incorrect because thin barriers are beneficial, not thick ones. Option C is not the primary explanation. Option D is incorrect because oxygen diffuses passively.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The normal cardiac conduction sequence begins at the sinoatrial (SA) node in the right atrium, which spontaneously depolarizes at approximately 70-80 times per minute (the natural pacemaker). The electrical impulse spreads through atrial muscle via gap junctions and internodal pathways, causing atrial contraction. The impulse reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node, where conduction is deliberately slowed (~0.1 sec delay) to allow atrial contraction to complete before ventricular contraction begins. From the AV node, the impulse travels through the Bundle of His in the interventricular septum, which divides into right and left bundle branches. These branches terminate in Purkinje fibers that rapidly distribute the impulse throughout the ventricular myocardium from apex to base, ensuring coordinated ventricular contraction. Option A reverses the SA and AV nodes. Options C and D scramble the correct sequence.",

      "explanation": "Fetal hemoglobin (\u03b12\u03b32) differs from adult hemoglobin (\u03b12\u03b22) in having gamma (\u03b3) globin subunits instead of beta (\u03b2) subunits. The critical functional difference is that gamma subunits have a serine residue at position 143 instead of the histidine found in beta subunits. Histidine-143 in beta subunits forms a critical cross-link with 2,3-BPG in the central cavity of the hemoglobin tetramer, stabilizing the low-affinity T-state. Without this histidine, HbF binds 2,3-BPG approximately 40% less effectively than HbA, shifting the equilibrium toward the high-affinity R-state. This higher oxygen affinity ensures that when maternal and fetal blood are in close proximity in the placenta (but never mix directly), oxygen preferentially transfers from maternal HbA to fetal HbF. Option A is incorrect because both have Fe2+. Option C is incorrect; both have 4 heme groups. Option D is incorrect because both operate at similar pH.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "According to Poiseuille's law, flow (Q) = (\u03c0 \u00d7 \u0394P \u00d7 r^4) / (8 \u00d7 \u03b7 \u00d7 L), where \u0394P is the pressure gradient, r is the vessel radius, \u03b7 is blood viscosity, and L is vessel length. Flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius. If the radius decreases to 50% (0.5r), the new flow is proportional to (0.5)^4 = 0.0625 = 6.25% of the original. This means flow decreases by 93.75%. This dramatic effect of small radius changes explains why arteriolar smooth muscle tone is the primary regulator of blood flow to different organs. A mere 20% change in radius would produce a 59% change in flow. Option A (50%) would apply if flow were linearly proportional to radius. Option B (75%) would apply for r^2 proportionality. Option C (87.5%) would apply for r^3. The r^4 relationship gives arterioles extraordinary control over regional blood flow distribution.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "CO2 produced by tissue metabolism enters the blood and is transported by three mechanisms. Approximately 70% is converted to bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) through the reaction: CO2 + H2O \u2192 H2CO3 \u2192 H+ + HCO3-, catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (CA) in red blood cells. The H+ is buffered by deoxyhemoglobin, and HCO3- exits the RBC via the chloride shift (Cl-/HCO3- anion exchanger, band 3 protein). Approximately 23% binds to the amino groups of hemoglobin (and other plasma proteins) to form carbaminohemoglobin (Hb-NH-COO-). Deoxyhemoglobin binds CO2 more readily than oxyhemoglobin (the Haldane effect). Approximately 7% remains dissolved in plasma as molecular CO2.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The baroreceptor reflex operates within seconds. Baroreceptors (stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors) in the carotid sinus (monitored via glossopharyngeal nerve, CN IX) and aortic arch (monitored via vagus nerve, CN X) continuously sense arterial pressure. When blood pressure drops, baroreceptor stretch decreases, reducing their firing rate. The cardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata interprets the reduced input and adjusts autonomic output: sympathetic outflow increases (via cardioacceleratory center) while parasympathetic (vagal) outflow decreases. The combined effects are: increased heart rate (positive chronotropy), increased contractility (positive inotropy), arteriolar vasoconstriction (increasing total peripheral resistance), and venoconstriction (increasing venous return). Together, these responses restore blood pressure within seconds. Option B describes chemoreceptor reflexes, which are slower and primarily regulate breathing. Option C reverses the baroreceptor response. Option D describes the RAAS system, which takes minutes to hours.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The fundamental difference is that in insects, the circulatory and respiratory systems are functionally decoupled. Hemolymph (insect blood) fills the hemocoel (body cavity) and directly bathes all internal organs. It is pumped by a dorsal tubular heart through an aorta but then exits into open hemocoel spaces. Hemolymph transports nutrients, hormones, and immune cells, but generally does NOT transport oxygen. Instead, oxygen delivery occurs through the tracheal system \u2014 a network of air-filled tubes (tracheae and tracheoles) that branch throughout the body and deliver oxygen directly to cells by diffusion. In contrast, mammalian blood carries oxygen bound to hemoglobin through a closed system of vessels. Option A is incorrect because insects have a tubular heart. Option C is incorrect because most insect hemolymph lacks oxygen-carrying pigments. Option D is incorrect because open systems operate at much lower pressures (~1-5 mmHg vs 120/80 mmHg).",

      "explanation": "The Haldane effect is the complementary counterpart of the Bohr effect. While the Bohr effect describes how CO2/H+ affects O2 binding, the Haldane effect describes how O2 binding affects CO2/H+ handling. Deoxyhemoglobin (T-state) has: (1) more available amino groups for carbamino formation (CO2 binding), carrying approximately 3x more CO2 as carbaminohemoglobin than oxyhemoglobin; (2) greater buffering capacity for H+ (the imidazole groups of histidine residues are more accessible in the T-state), facilitating the bicarbonate pathway. In the lungs, as hemoglobin becomes oxygenated (transition to R-state), it releases CO2 and H+, promoting CO2 excretion. At tissues, deoxygenation facilitates CO2 uptake.

The reduced surface area decreases the rate of gas diffusion (per Fick's law: diffusion rate proportional to surface area). Because CO2 is ~20x more diffusible than O2 (due to its higher solubility), early emphysema may show only hypoxemia with normal CO2. However, in severe emphysema, even CO2 elimination is impaired, leading to hypercapnia. The retained CO2 shifts the equilibrium: CO2 + H2O \u2192 H2CO3 \u2192 H+ + HCO3-, increasing [H+] and decreasing pH (respiratory acidosis). Additionally, air trapping and hyperinflation increase dead space ventilation, further reducing effective gas exchange. Option A would be seen only in very mild disease.

      "explanation": "The sigmoidal (S-shaped) oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin results from cooperative binding, a consequence of its tetrameric quaternary structure (\u03b12\u03b22). When the first O2 molecule binds to a subunit of deoxyhemoglobin (T-state, tense state), it induces a conformational change in that subunit that is transmitted through subunit-subunit interfaces to the other subunits, partially shifting them toward the R-state (relaxed state) conformation. Each subsequent O2 binding further stabilizes the R-state, progressively increasing the affinity for additional O2. This produces the characteristic steep portion of the curve between PO2 of 20-60 mmHg. The physiological significance is that small changes in PO2 in this range produce large changes in hemoglobin saturation, facilitating both loading in the lungs and unloading at tissues. Myoglobin, being a monomer, lacks cooperative interactions and shows simple hyperbolic binding kinetics. Option A is incorrect (hemoglobin has 4 heme groups). Option C is incorrect.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 5-fold increase in cardiac output during maximal exercise results from coordinated increases in both heart rate and stroke volume. Heart rate increases from approximately 70 bpm to 180-200 bpm (~2.5-fold) through: (1) withdrawal of parasympathetic (vagal) tone on the SA node, and (2) increased sympathetic stimulation releasing norepinephrine, which acts on beta-1 adrenergic receptors to increase SA node automaticity and AV node conduction velocity. Stroke volume increases from approximately 70 mL to 130-140 mL (~2-fold) through: (1) the Frank-Starling mechanism \u2014 increased venous return from the skeletal muscle pump and venoconstriction increases EDV; (2) increased contractility (inotropy) \u2014 sympathetic stimulation enhances calcium release from the SR and increases myosin ATPase activity. Together: 2.5 x 2 = 5-fold increase. Option A and C each account for only part of the response. Option D is not a significant mechanism.",

      "explanation": "Normal elastic arteries (particularly the aorta) perform a critical 'Windkessel' function: they expand during systole to store a portion of the stroke volume, then recoil during diastole to continue pushing blood forward. This buffers the pulsatile output of the heart into more continuous flow. When arterial walls stiffen (due to arteriosclerosis, aging, calcification), they cannot expand as much during systole, so the full force of ventricular ejection is transmitted directly to the blood, raising systolic pressure. During diastole, the stiff walls cannot recoil effectively, so diastolic pressure falls. The net result is an increased pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. This also increases cardiac afterload and myocardial oxygen demand. Option A is the opposite of what occurs. Option C is unrelated to arterial compliance. Option D is not a direct consequence.",

S2: Capillaries are the simplest blood vessels, consisting only of endothelial cells surrounded by a basement membrane, creating the thinnest possible barrier (0.5-1 \u03bcm) for diffusion. Some capillaries have pores (fenestrated) or gaps (sinusoidal) for even greater exchange capacity.

S4: Arterioles (15-300 \u03bcm diameter) have a proportionally thick smooth muscle layer that can significantly change vessel radius.

A disadvantage is that blood pressure drops significantly after passing through gill capillaries, limiting systemic blood flow rate. S2 is TRUE: Most amphibians have a three-chambered heart with some mixing in the ventricle. However, internal ridges and differential timing of atrial contraction direct most oxygenated blood toward the systemic arch and most deoxygenated blood toward the pulmocutaneous arch, achieving partial separation. S3 is FALSE: While crocodilians do have a four-chambered heart with a complete ventricular septum, they possess a unique feature: the foramen of Panizza, a connection between the left and right aortic arches, and a left aorta that exits the right ventricle. This allows a right-to-left shunt during diving, bypassing the lungs. This is NOT identical to mammalian heart function.

S2 is FALSE: Hyperventilation dramatically decreases arterial PCO2 (from ~40 to ~20 mmHg) but increases arterial PO2 only modestly (from ~100 to ~110-120 mmHg). This is because hemoglobin is already ~98% saturated at normal PO2, and the additional O2 from hyperventilation mostly dissolves in plasma without significantly increasing total O2 content. The main effect of hyperventilation is CO2 washout causing respiratory alkalosis.

At metabolically active tissues, CO2 production lowers pH (via H2CO3 dissociation), which decreases hemoglobin's O2 affinity, promoting O2 release. S2 is FALSE: The statement reverses the effect. The Bohr effect promotes oxygen UNLOADING (not loading) at tissues. At tissues, low pH and high CO2 decrease hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, causing it to release O2. In the lungs, high pH and low CO2 increase affinity, promoting O2 loading. Option S2 has the correct concept backward. S3 is TRUE: Protons (H+) bind to specific histidine residues (particularly His-146 on beta subunits) forming salt bridges that stabilize the T-state. CO2 reacts with N-terminal amino groups to form carbamino groups (R-NH-COO-), also stabilizing the T-state. Both favor the low-affinity conformation. S4 is FALSE: Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) does exhibit a Bohr effect, though it may be slightly smaller in magnitude than adult hemoglobin.

The total cross-sectional area of all capillaries combined (~2500 cm^2) is approximately 625 times larger than the aorta (~4 cm^2), so velocity must be 625 times slower.

At each PO2, total blood O2 content is measured (e.g., using a Van Slyke apparatus or modern blood gas analyzer).

The dissolved O2 follows Henry's law linearly: dissolved O2 = 0.003 mL O2/dL/mmHg \u00d7 PO2. At PO2 = 100 mmHg, dissolved O2 = 0.3 mL/dL. The difference between total blood O2 content (~20 mL O2/dL at PO2 100) and dissolved O2 (0.3 mL/dL) represents hemoglobin-bound O2 (~19.7 mL/dL, or 98.5% of total).

      "explanation": "Hemocyanin and hemoglobin are convergent solutions to the problem of oxygen transport. Hemocyanin contains two copper (Cu+) ions per oxygen-binding site (not heme) and is dissolved directly in hemolymph rather than packaged in cells. When oxygenated (Cu2+ state), it appears blue; when deoxygenated, it is colorless. Its O2-carrying capacity is approximately 1/4 to 1/10 that of hemoglobin per unit volume because: (1) dissolved proteins cannot achieve the concentration that packed RBCs provide, and (2) each hemocyanin subunit binds fewer O2 molecules relative to its mass. Hemoglobin uses iron (Fe2+) in a heme prosthetic group, is contained within erythrocytes (allowing very high concentration), and appears red when oxygenated. Option A reverses the metals.

As a gas, NO freely diffuses across cell membranes to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, where it binds to the heme group of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), activating it to convert GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which promotes smooth muscle relaxation through multiple mechanisms: dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, sequestration of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and opening of K+ channels causing hyperpolarization. The resulting vasodilation increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure. NO also inhibits platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion.

      "explanation": "The insect tracheal system relies on diffusion of O2 through air-filled tubes (tracheae and tracheoles) to deliver oxygen directly to cells. While air-phase diffusion is approximately 10,000 times faster than liquid-phase diffusion (a major advantage over dissolved O2 in blood), diffusion time increases with the square of distance. For a tube of length L, diffusion time \u221d L^2. This means that doubling the distance quadruples the delivery time. At short distances (millimeters), diffusion is nearly instantaneous and more efficient than any circulatory system. But beyond a few centimeters, diffusion becomes too slow to meet cellular metabolic demands, particularly for active flight muscles. This explains why the largest insects (like some tropical beetles at ~15 cm) are much smaller than vertebrates that use convective oxygen delivery via blood. During the Carboniferous period, higher atmospheric O2 (35% vs. 21% today) allowed larger insects (dragonflies with 70 cm wingspans). Options A, C, and D cite non-primary or incorrect limitations.",

Intuition suggests that high-altitude animals should have high-affinity hemoglobin (low P50) to load O2 more efficiently from the thin air. However, the bar-headed goose has evolved a LOWER affinity hemoglobin (P50 = 30 vs. 26 for human HbA). This is because at extreme altitude, the challenge is not only O2 loading but also O2 delivery to tissues, especially the flight muscles performing intense aerobic work. A lower-affinity hemoglobin ensures efficient O2 unloading at the tissues. To compensate for reduced loading efficiency, the goose has evolved: (1) hyperventilation with efficient gas exchange in parabronchial lungs; (2) increased cardiac output; (3) enhanced capillary density in flight muscles; (4) mitochondria positioned closer to capillaries.

The formula weights diastolic pressure more heavily because the heart spends approximately twice as long in diastole (2/3 of the cardiac cycle) as in systole (1/3 of the cardiac cycle) at rest.

Option A (100 mmHg) would be the arithmetic mean, ignoring the time-weighting. Option C represents diastolic pressure alone. Option D overestimates by weighting systolic pressure too heavily.

Even low environmental CO concentrations can produce significant HbCO levels.

(2) Platelet adhesion: von Willebrand factor (vWF, a large multimeric glycoprotein) bridges collagen and platelet GP Ib-IX-V receptors, tethering platelets to the injury site under high-shear conditions. Platelets also bind collagen directly via GP VI and integrin alpha-2-beta-1. (3) Platelet activation: Contact with collagen and thrombin activates platelets, causing shape change (discoid to spiny sphere), degranulation (releasing ADP, serotonin, TxA2), and expression of activated GP IIb/IIIa receptors on their surface. (4) Platelet aggregation: Fibrinogen (and vWF) bridges adjacent activated platelets by binding to GP IIb/IIIa receptors on neighboring platelets, forming the platelet plug. This primary hemostatic plug is then reinforced by secondary hemostasis (the coagulation cascade producing fibrin). Options A, C, and D scramble or fabricate the sequence.",

Instead of alveolar dead-end sacs (mammalian design), bird lungs contain parabronchi \u2014 rigid, open-ended tubes through which air flows continuously in one direction. Air sacs (anterior and posterior groups) act as bellows, directing air through the parabronchi during both inspiration and expiration through a two-cycle breathing mechanism. This creates continuous, unidirectional airflow over the gas exchange surfaces (air capillaries that branch from parabronchi). Blood flow through the lung capillaries is arranged in a crosscurrent pattern relative to airflow, achieving more efficient gas exchange than the tidal (bidirectional) ventilation of mammalian alveoli. This explains why birds can fly at altitudes where mammals would be incapacitated. Option A is incorrect; bird lungs are compact but highly efficient.

(2) Nitric oxide (NO) from eNOS inhibits platelet adhesion and activation. (3) Thrombomodulin on the endothelial surface binds thrombin, changing its substrate specificity from pro-coagulant (fibrinogen cleavage) to anticoagulant (protein C activation).

After repolarization, the funny current (HCN channels conducting Na+ inward and K+ outward at negative potentials) creates a gradual depolarization. As the membrane potential reaches about -40 mV, T-type and then L-type Ca2+ channels open, producing the upstroke. This automatic depolarization makes the SA node the heart's pacemaker. S2 is TRUE: The ventricular action potential has 5 phases (0-4), with the plateau (Phase 2) lasting approximately 200-300 ms due to a balance between inward L-type Ca2+ current and outward delayed rectifier K+ currents. This prolonged plateau creates a long absolute refractory period, preventing tetanus. S3 is FALSE: The cardiac refractory period is MUCH LONGER than skeletal muscle (200-300 ms vs. 1-2 ms), not shorter. This long refractory period is essential to prevent tetanic contraction, which would stop the heart from filling between beats.

This is the classic Starling model. S2 is TRUE: Plasma colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure is approximately 25-28 mmHg, primarily generated by albumin (which accounts for ~80% of total osmotic pressure due to its high concentration and net negative charge attracting Na+ and water). This oncotic pressure opposes filtration throughout the capillary length.

This is negative-pressure ventilation, as opposed to the positive-pressure ventilation used in mechanical ventilators. S2 is TRUE: Most amphibians use a buccal pump mechanism. Air is drawn into the buccal (oral) cavity by lowering the floor of the mouth, then the nostrils close and the floor of the mouth rises, pushing (forcing) air into the lungs under positive pressure.

      "explanation": "Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is the unique property of pulmonary arterioles to constrict in response to local alveolar hypoxia (this is the opposite of systemic vessels, which dilate in response to hypoxia). To demonstrate this is a local, intrinsic mechanism, an isolated pulmonary vessel preparation eliminates confounding neural and humoral influences. By exposing the isolated vessel to varying PO2 levels while measuring diameter (or resistance), the direct effect of oxygen tension on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle can be demonstrated. In hypoxic conditions, pulmonary arterioles should constrict, diverting blood away from poorly ventilated (hypoxic) alveoli toward better-ventilated regions, optimizing V/Q matching. The mechanism involves inhibition of oxygen-sensitive K+ channels in pulmonary smooth muscle cells, causing depolarization and Ca2+ entry. Option A tests global HPV but cannot isolate the mechanism. Option C is observational. Option D tests systemic, not pulmonary, responses.",

Their thin, broad profile minimizes diffusion distance for gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes (alveolar type II cells) are more numerous but smaller, cuboidal cells that cover about 5% of the alveolar surface.

In the oxygenated (R) state, HbS behaves normally because the hydrophobic contact site on adjacent tetramers is not exposed. However, in the deoxygenated (T) state, a conformational change exposes a hydrophobic pocket near Phe-85 and Leu-88 on another HbS molecule. The valine-6 inserts into this pocket, creating an intermolecular contact that nucleates HbS polymerization into long, rigid fibers (14 strands in a helical bundle). These fibers deform the normally biconcave, flexible RBC into a rigid, crescent (sickle) shape. Sickled cells cannot deform to pass through narrow capillaries, causing vaso-occlusion, painful crises, organ damage, and hemolytic anemia. Option A describes an affinity problem, not polymerization.

(2) Increased CO2 directly relaxes smooth muscle and generates H+ that does the same. (3) Decreased pH (from CO2, lactate, and other acids) causes vasodilation. (4) Increased extracellular K+ (from active muscle depolarization) hyperpolarizes smooth muscle via inward-rectifying K+ channels, causing relaxation. (5) Adenosine (from ATP degradation in oxygen-depleted tissue) is a potent vasodilator acting on A2 receptors. (6) Increased blood flow causes shear stress on endothelium, stimulating eNOS to produce NO, further promoting vasodilation.

This makes them universal recipients: they can receive transfusions of any ABO type (A, B, AB, or O) without ABO-mediated agglutination, because they lack the antibodies that would attack foreign RBCs.

Simultaneously, the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction in non-essential vascular beds: splanchnic (gut) circulation receives reduced flow (from ~25% at rest to ~3% during exercise), as do the kidneys (from ~25% to ~2%). However, coronary blood flow increases (meeting increased myocardial O2 demand), and cutaneous blood flow initially decreases then increases as body temperature rises and heat dissipation becomes necessary.

        "The seal produces lactate only after surfacing due to rewarming of cold muscles",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a classic phenomenon of the diving reflex demonstrating the physiological compartmentalization strategy. During the dive, the profound peripheral vasoconstriction (reducing blood flow to 3-10% of normal in muscles, gut, kidneys) effectively isolates these tissues from the central circulation. Peripheral muscles, deprived of oxygen supply, switch to anaerobic glycolysis and produce lactate. However, the severe vasoconstriction prevents this lactate from being washed into the central blood, which is why central blood lactate only rises slightly (1.0 to 2.0 mmol/L over 15 minutes). Meanwhile, the brain and heart continue receiving oxygenated blood and metabolize aerobically. Upon surfacing, the dive reflex reverses: vasodilation restores peripheral blood flow, and the large pool of accumulated peripheral lactate is rapidly flushed into the central circulation, causing the dramatic spike to 15 mmol/L within minutes. This compartmentalization strategy protects the brain from acidosis during the dive.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In the upright lung, gravity profoundly affects both ventilation and perfusion, but perfusion more than ventilation. Blood flow increases from apex to base because hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary circulation increases with vertical distance below the pulmonary artery. At the apex, pulmonary arterial pressure may be lower than alveolar pressure, partially collapsing capillaries (Zone 1 conditions). At the base, high hydrostatic pressure fully distends capillaries and recruits additional vessels. Ventilation also increases from apex to base (because basal alveoli are more compressed at rest and have more room to expand during inspiration), but the gradient is less steep than for perfusion. The result is a V/Q ratio of ~3.3 at the apex (relatively wasted ventilation) and ~0.6 at the base (relatively wasted perfusion). The whole-lung average V/Q is approximately 0.8. Ideal gas exchange occurs where V/Q = 1.0 (middle zones). Option A is misleading; high V/Q means relative dead space. Option C ignores perfusion gradients. Option D is incorrect.",

      "explanation": "The Nernst equation for a monovalent cation is: E = (RT/zF) \u00d7 ln([ion]out/[ion]in). At 37\u00b0C, RT/F = 26.7 mV. For K+ (z = +1): EK = 26.7 mV \u00d7 ln(5/140) = 26.7 mV \u00d7 ln(0.0357) = 26.7 \u00d7 (-3.33) = -89 mV, approximately -90 mV. This is very close to the typical resting membrane potential of neurons (-70 mV), reflecting the dominant role of K+ leak channels in setting the resting potential. The slight deviation from EK occurs because the membrane has some permeability to Na+ and Cl-. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation accounts for all permeable ions. In clinical contexts, hyperkalemia (elevated extracellular K+) depolarizes neurons because EK becomes less negative.",

This fast inactivation occurs within 1-2 ms of channel opening, terminating Na+ influx. Simultaneously, voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, which have slower activation kinetics (delayed rectifier channels), open in response to the same depolarization. The combination of Na+ channel inactivation and K+ channel opening drives repolarization. The Na+/K+ ATPase is too slow (pumping ~100 ions/s vs millions flowing through channels/s) to contribute significantly during the action potential itself; it restores gradients over longer periods.",

      "explanation": "The GHK voltage equation calculates membrane potential as a weighted average of equilibrium potentials for all permeable ions, with weighting determined by relative permeabilities. At rest, the high K+ permeability dominates, pulling Vm near EK (-90 mV). During the peak of the action potential, voltage-gated Na+ channels open massively, increasing PNa to approximately 20\u00d7 PK. With PNa now dominant, the membrane potential shifts toward ENa (+55 mV for typical intracellular [Na+] = 15 mM and extracellular [Na+] = 145 mM). The overshoot of the action potential (typically reaching +30 to +40 mV) doesn't quite reach ENa because K+ permeability is not zero and some K+ channels are beginning to open.

These toxins are positively charged guanidinium compounds that physically occlude the ion conduction pathway from the outside, preventing Na+ ions from entering the pore. The binding site is formed by specific glutamate and aspartate residues in the selectivity filter (the DEKA ring in Nav channels). TTX-resistant Na+ channels (like Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 in nociceptors) have amino acid substitutions in this region. Local anesthetics (lidocaine, procaine), in contrast, bind inside the pore from the intracellular side and show use-dependent block.

      "explanation": "Synaptic vesicle fusion is mediated by the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor) complex. The v-SNARE synaptobrevin (VAMP2) on the vesicle membrane forms a four-helix bundle with the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic plasma membrane. This trans-SNARE complex 'zippers' from the N-terminus toward the C-terminal transmembrane domains, pulling the two membranes into close apposition and overcoming the energy barrier for lipid bilayer fusion. The process requires Ca2+ sensing by synaptotagmin-1 (the Ca2+ sensor), which binds Ca2+ through its C2A and C2B domains and interacts with SNAREs and phospholipids to trigger rapid fusion. Complexin acts as a clamp that prevents spontaneous fusion until Ca2+ arrives. Munc18 and Munc13 are essential regulators of SNARE assembly. Clathrin mediates vesicle endocytosis (recycling), and dynamin mediates vesicle scission during endocytosis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The absolute refractory period is caused by the inactivated state of voltage-gated Na+ channels. After opening (activated state), Na+ channels rapidly transition to the inactivated state via the ball-and-chain mechanism. Inactivated channels CANNOT be reopened by any amount of depolarization \u2014 they must first recover to the closed (resting) state, which requires membrane repolarization (or hyperpolarization) to allow the inactivation gate to reset and the activation gate to close. This recovery from inactivation takes 1-2 ms at normal resting potential. During this time, no stimulus, however strong, can elicit an action potential. The relative refractory period follows, during which some Na+ channels have recovered but K+ channels are still open, requiring a stronger-than-normal stimulus. The absolute refractory period ensures unidirectional propagation of action potentials and limits maximum firing frequency.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Myelination by Schwann cells (PNS) or oligodendrocytes (CNS) wraps multiple layers of lipid-rich membrane around the axon at internodal regions. This has two critical biophysical effects: (1) it dramatically increases membrane resistance (Rm), reducing ion leakage across the internodal membrane, and (2) it greatly decreases membrane capacitance (Cm), because the multiple myelin layers act as capacitors in series. The cable equation shows that the length constant (lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri)) increases with higher Rm, meaning passive current spreads farther before decaying. Lower Cm means the membrane charges faster. Together, these effects allow depolarizing current from one node of Ranvier to spread rapidly and with minimal attenuation to the next node (1-2 mm away), where the high density of Nav1.6 channels regenerates the action potential. This 'jumping' of action potentials between nodes is saltatory conduction, increasing speed from ~1 m/s (unmyelinated) to ~100 m/s.",

      "explanation": "GABA_A receptors are pentameric ligand-gated Cl- channels (members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, along with glycine, nicotinic ACh, and 5-HT3 receptors). When GABA binds, the channel opens and Cl- flows down its electrochemical gradient. In mature neurons, intracellular Cl- concentration is maintained low (~5 mM) by the KCC2 Cl- transporter (K+-Cl- cotransporter), so ECl is typically around -80 mV. When GABA_A channels open, Cl- flows inward, hyperpolarizing the membrane (classical IPSP). Even when ECl is near resting potential, GABA_A activation provides 'shunting inhibition' \u2014 the increased Cl- conductance short-circuits excitatory currents by clamping the membrane near ECl. Notably, in immature neurons, NKCC1 (Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter) maintains high intracellular Cl-, making ECl more positive and GABA excitatory during development.

      "explanation": "NMDA receptors have three unique properties that make them molecular coincidence detectors: (1) They require simultaneous binding of glutamate (and the co-agonist glycine or D-serine) AND postsynaptic depolarization. At resting potential, extracellular Mg2+ ions physically block the channel pore in a voltage-dependent manner. Only when the postsynaptic membrane is sufficiently depolarized (typically by AMPA receptor activation) is the Mg2+ block relieved, allowing ion flow. (2) NMDA receptors are highly permeable to Ca2+ (in addition to Na+ and K+), and this Ca2+ influx activates CaMKII, calcineurin, and other signaling cascades that mediate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). (3) They have slow activation and deactivation kinetics compared to AMPA receptors. CNQX blocks AMPA/kainate receptors; APV/MK-801 block NMDA receptors.

AChE is anchored to the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft at the NMJ via a collagen-like tail (ColQ). The choline produced is recycled back into the presynaptic terminal by the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1/SLC5A7) and used to resynthesize ACh by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT).

CaMKII is a holoenzyme of 12 subunits that undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr286 when bound to Ca2+/calmodulin. This autophosphorylation converts CaMKII to a constitutively active state that persists even after Ca2+ levels return to baseline \u2014 acting as a molecular 'memory' of the Ca2+ signal. Active CaMKII phosphorylates GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors at Ser831, increasing their single-channel conductance. CaMKII also promotes trafficking of additional AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane from intracellular pools, increasing the number of functional receptors at the synapse.

However, the PRIMARY contribution of the pump to the resting potential is indirect \u2014 by maintaining the K+ and Na+ concentration gradients that drive passive ion fluxes through leak channels. Without the pump, gradients would dissipate over minutes to hours, and the resting potential would collapse. The resting potential (-70 mV) is mostly determined by the K+ gradient through K+ leak channels (Kir and K2P/TWIK channels), with a small contribution from Na+ permeability.

Ca2+ binding neutralizes the negative charges of the aspartate residues in the Ca2+-binding loops, allowing these loops to penetrate the negatively charged plasma membrane (particularly PS-containing leaflets). This membrane insertion brings the vesicle and plasma membrane into closer proximity. Simultaneously, Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin interacts with the SNARE complex, particularly displacing the clamp protein complexin, which normally prevents the SNARE complex from completing the final steps of fusion. This releases the SNAREs to complete zippering and drive membrane merger.

Each binding site is formed by loops A, B, and C from the alpha subunit (principal face) and loops D, E, and F from the adjacent non-alpha subunit (complementary face). Both sites must be occupied for efficient channel opening (cooperative binding). The channel then opens to conduct Na+ and K+ (with slight Ca2+ permeability), producing the end-plate potential (EPP). The requirement for two ACh molecules creates a sigmoidal dose-response curve and ensures that the channel opens only when ACh concentration is sufficiently high. Tubocurarine (curare) is a competitive antagonist that blocks ACh binding at these sites. Alpha-bungarotoxin from banded krait binds irreversibly to the alpha subunit binding site.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1, VGLUT2, VGLUT3) are driven by the proton electrochemical gradient across the synaptic vesicle membrane, which is generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). The V-ATPase pumps H+ into the vesicle lumen, creating both a pH gradient (delta-pH, lumen acidic) and a membrane potential (delta-psi, lumen positive). VGLUTs primarily use the delta-psi (electrical) component of the gradient as the driving force, exchanging luminal H+ for cytoplasmic glutamate (acting as a glutamate/H+ exchanger). This contrasts with vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT), which rely more heavily on the delta-pH component. Disrupting the V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 collapses the proton gradient and blocks vesicular glutamate loading, ultimately inhibiting glutamatergic transmission. VGLUT does not directly hydrolyze ATP. Plasma membrane glutamate transporters (EAATs) use the Na+ gradient, but vesicular transporters use H+ gradients.",

      "explanation": "The most direct evidence for excitatory or inhibitory function comes from intracellular recording of the postsynaptic response. Applying the peptide locally by iontophoresis (using current to eject charged molecules from a micropipette) while recording the postsynaptic membrane potential reveals whether it causes depolarization (EPSP, excitatory) or hyperpolarization (IPSP, inhibitory). Voltage-clamp recording provides additional mechanistic information: the reversal potential of the peptide-induced current indicates which ions carry the current (reversal near 0 mV suggests a non-selective cation current/excitatory; reversal near ECl suggests Cl- channel/inhibitory; reversal near EK suggests K+ channel/inhibitory). Pharmacological blockers can then identify specific receptor types. Field potential recordings are less specific and don't distinguish direct effects from network effects. Ca2+ imaging shows presynaptic function, not postsynaptic excitation/inhibition.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The axon initial segment has the lowest action potential threshold (~15 mV depolarization from rest, compared to ~30 mV for the soma) because it contains the highest density of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuron \u2014 approximately 50-100 times the density found in the soma. These channels, primarily Nav1.6 (which has a lower activation threshold than Nav1.2), are anchored and clustered by the scaffold protein ankyrin-G (AnkG), which binds both Na+ channels and the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton at the AIS. AnkG also recruits Kv7 (KCNQ) channels for spike threshold regulation and the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin-186. The AIS is typically 20-60 um long, beginning at the junction of axon and soma. The diffusion barrier at the AIS (formed by an actin-spectrin-based membrane fence) maintains the distinct molecular composition of the axonal versus somatodendritic compartments.

      "explanation": "Muscarinic M2 receptors are coupled to Gi/Go proteins. When ACh (released from the vagus nerve) binds M2 receptors on cardiac pacemaker cells, the Gi protein dissociates into alpha-i and beta-gamma subunits. The beta-gamma dimer directly binds to and opens GIRK channels (Kir3.1/Kir3.4 heteromers, also called IKACh). The increased K+ conductance hyperpolarizes the cell, slowing the rate of spontaneous depolarization and reducing heart rate (negative chronotropic effect). Additionally, the alpha-i subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP levels and decreasing If (funny current) and L-type Ca2+ channel activity. This is one of the fastest GPCR-mediated effects because it involves direct channel gating by beta-gamma (membrane-delimited signaling) rather than a second messenger cascade.

      "explanation": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the predominant pathway for synaptic vesicle recycling at most central synapses during moderate stimulation. After full fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane, the vesicle proteins and membrane are retrieved by: (1) adaptor proteins (AP-2, AP180/CALM, stonin-2) recognizing vesicle protein sorting signals; (2) clathrin triskelions assembling into a lattice around the coated pit; (3) dynamin GTPase assembling as a collar around the neck and catalyzing membrane scission upon GTP hydrolysis; (4) auxilin/GAK recruiting Hsc70 to uncoat the clathrin. The recycled vesicle is then acidified by V-ATPase and refilled with neurotransmitter. Kiss-and-run occurs but is less prevalent. During intense stimulation, activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) retrieves large membrane portions that are later processed into individual vesicles via endosomal sorting.

      "explanation": "Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are lipid-derived retrograde messengers synthesized on demand from postsynaptic membrane phospholipids. 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol, the primary eCB at most synapses) is produced by diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLalpha) in response to postsynaptic depolarization and/or mGluR activation that elevates Ca2+ and activates PLCbeta. Being lipophilic, eCBs diffuse retrogradely across the synaptic cleft without vesicular release. They activate presynaptic CB1 receptors (Gi/o-coupled GPCRs), which inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (N-type and P/Q-type) and activate GIRK channels, reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx and neurotransmitter release probability. This mediates depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) at GABAergic synapses and depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) at glutamatergic synapses.

Classical small-molecule transmitters (glutamate, GABA, ACh, catecholamines) are synthesized locally in presynaptic terminals by cytoplasmic enzymes, loaded into small synaptic vesicles (SSVs, ~40 nm) by vesicular transporters, and released from the active zone by single action potentials. In contrast, neuropeptides are gene products that are transcribed in the nucleus, translated on rough ER, processed in the Golgi, and packaged into large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs, 80-200 nm) in the cell body. LDCVs are then transported to terminals by fast axonal transport (kinesin motors, ~1 um/s). Neuropeptide release typically requires high-frequency or burst firing to produce sufficient Ca2+ accumulation, and LDCVs fuse at perisynaptic/extrasynaptic sites (not restricted to active zones). Neuropeptides are inactivated by extracellular peptidases, not reuptake, and cannot be locally recycled.",

A higher Rm (less membrane leakage) allows current to travel farther before leaking out. A lower Ri (less axoplasmic resistance, achieved by larger axon diameter) allows current to flow more easily along the axon. For unmyelinated axons, lambda is typically 0.1-1 mm. Myelination dramatically increases Rm (and reduces Cm), increasing lambda to 1-2 mm (matching internode distance). The time constant (tau = Rm \u00d7 Cm) determines how quickly the membrane charges/discharges but is not the length constant.

      "explanation": "Excitotoxicity is primarily mediated by Ca2+ overload. During ischemia (stroke) or trauma, excessive glutamate accumulates in the extracellular space (due to energy failure preventing reuptake by EAATs and causing reversed glutamate transport). Sustained activation of NMDA receptors (and AMPA receptors in neurons expressing Ca2+-permeable AMPA-Rs lacking GluA2) causes massive Ca2+ influx. Excessive intracellular Ca2+ activates destructive enzymes: (1) calpains (Ca2+-dependent proteases) that degrade cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules; (2) phospholipase A2 that releases arachidonic acid, generating inflammatory prostaglandins and free radicals; (3) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) producing NO, which combines with superoxide to form peroxynitrite; (4) mitochondrial Ca2+ overload triggers the permeability transition pore, releasing cytochrome c and initiating apoptosis.

The m variable (activation) ranges from 0 to 1 and increases rapidly with depolarization (fast kinetics, tau_m ~0.1-0.5 ms). The cubic power m\u00b3 reflects that three independent activation 'gates' must all be open simultaneously. The h variable (inactivation) ranges from 1 (all gates open) to 0 (all gates closed) and decreases with depolarization but with slower kinetics (tau_h ~1-5 ms). The channel conducts only when m\u00b3 \u00d7 h > 0 \u2014 that is, when all activation gates are open AND the inactivation gate has not yet closed.

This means approximately 80 synaptic vesicles fuse simultaneously during a normal nerve impulse. When quantal content drops to 20 (EPP = 10 mV) but mEPP amplitude remains 0.5 mV, this indicates a presynaptic defect. Each individual vesicle still produces a normal response (mEPP = 0.5 mV, meaning postsynaptic receptors are functioning normally), but fewer vesicles are released per impulse. This pattern is characteristic of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), where autoantibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels reduce Ca2+ influx and vesicle release.

      "options": [
        "NO is stored in synaptic vesicles and released by exocytosis like classical transmitters",
        "NO is a membrane-permeant gas synthesized on demand by neuronal NOS (nNOS) that diffuses freely across membranes without requiring receptors, directly activating soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous neurotransmitter that defies virtually every classical criterion for neurotransmitters. (1) It is not stored in vesicles \u2014 it is synthesized on demand by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from L-arginine, requiring Ca2+/calmodulin for activation (typically activated by NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx). (2) It is not released by exocytosis \u2014 as a small nonpolar gas, NO diffuses freely across lipid bilayers in all directions, affecting multiple nearby cells within a ~100 um radius (volume transmission). (3) It does not bind to membrane receptors \u2014 it enters target cells and directly activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which converts GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates PKG, cGMP-gated channels, or cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases. (4) Its action is terminated by its short half-life (~1-5 seconds) due to reaction with superoxide and hemoglobin. NO has been implicated in LTP at some synapses as a retrograde messenger.",

The strategy involves: (1) Expressing ChR2 (channelrhodopsin-2) specifically in neurons of region A using a Cre-dependent AAV virus in a Cre-driver mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase in the desired cell type. (2) After allowing time for ChR2 to be transported to axon terminals in region B, performing acute brain slice recordings. (3) Whole-cell patch-clamp recording from individual neurons in region B while delivering brief light pulses to activate ChR2-expressing terminals from region A. (4) The postsynaptic currents reveal whether the projection is excitatory (EPSC, blocked by CNQX/APV) or inhibitory (IPSC, blocked by picrotoxin/bicuculline). This approach has cell-type specificity (Cre targeting), pathway specificity (terminal stimulation), and provides direct electrophysiological evidence of connection type.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is caused by autoantibodies (primarily IgG1 and IgG3) directed against the alpha1 subunit of nicotinic ACh receptors at the NMJ (in ~85% of cases; the remainder have antibodies against MuSK or LRP4). These antibodies cause pathology through three mechanisms: (1) crosslinking and accelerated internalization of nAChRs (antigenic modulation); (2) complement activation (C3 deposition, membrane attack complex formation) that damages the postsynaptic membrane and simplifies the junctional folds; (3) direct blockade of the ACh binding site on some antibodies. The net result is dramatically reduced nAChR density (from ~10,000/um\u00b2 to ~1,000/um\u00b2), smaller mEPPs, and reduced safety factor for neuromuscular transmission. Symptoms (fatigable weakness) occur because repeated stimulation depletes the readily releasable vesicle pool, and with fewer receptors, the EPP falls below threshold.

        "Serotonin directly opens additional Na+ channels in the sensory neuron axon",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This mechanism, elucidated by Eric Kandel (Nobel Prize 2000), is a classic example of neuromodulation. During sensitization, serotonergic facilitatory interneurons release 5-HT onto the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. 5-HT activates Gs-coupled metabotropic receptors, stimulating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP. cAMP activates PKA (protein kinase A), which: (1) phosphorylates and closes certain K+ channels (S-type K+ channels), reducing K+ efflux and broadening the presynaptic action potential. A wider action potential keeps voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open longer, allowing more Ca2+ influx. (2) PKA also directly enhances the vesicle release machinery (phosphorylating synapsin and other release proteins), increasing the probability of vesicle fusion for a given Ca2+ signal. The net result is enhanced glutamate release from sensory neuron terminals onto motor neurons, producing a larger EPP and stronger gill withdrawal. Long-term facilitation additionally involves CREB-dependent gene expression and growth of new synaptic connections.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Astrocytes are essential for glutamate homeostasis. They express EAAT1 (GLAST) and EAAT2 (GLT-1) transporters that remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Inside astrocytes, glutamine synthetase converts glutamate to glutamine, which is released and taken up by neurons to regenerate glutamate (and GABA via GAD). This cycle prevents excitotoxicity and maintains neurotransmitter pools. S2 is TRUE: Each oligodendrocyte extends multiple processes that form myelin segments (internodes) around different axons \u2014 a single oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 50 axon segments. S3 is FALSE: Unlike oligodendrocytes, each Schwann cell myelinates only a SINGLE internode on a SINGLE axon. The one-to-one relationship means that PNS nerve injury (requiring remyelination) involves Schwann cell proliferation and sequential remyelination. Non-myelinating Schwann cells (Remak cells) ensheath multiple small-diameter axons without myelination. S4 is TRUE: Microglia prune excess synapses during development by recognizing complement proteins (C1q, C3) deposited on 'weak' synapses and phagocytosing them.",

The resting membrane potential is measured at -70 mV. When GABA is applied (opening GABA_A Cl- channels), the membrane potential shifts to -75 mV. If the neuron is first depolarized to -60 mV (by current injection) and then GABA is applied, what will happen to the membrane potential?",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "GABA_A receptors conduct Cl- ions, and the direction of Cl- flux depends on the relationship between the membrane potential and ECl. With ECl = -80 mV: At the resting potential (-70 mV), Vm is above ECl, so opening Cl- channels drives Cl- inward (hyperpolarizing from -70 to -75 mV, producing a small IPSP). At -60 mV (depolarized by current injection), Vm is even further above ECl, so there is a larger driving force for Cl- influx. GABA application will hyperpolarize the membrane from -60 mV toward ECl (-80 mV), producing a significant IPSP. If the membrane were at exactly -80 mV (= ECl), GABA would produce no voltage change (reversal potential). If the membrane were below -80 mV, GABA would actually depolarize the membrane toward ECl. This illustrates shunting inhibition \u2014 even without voltage change, the increased Cl- conductance opposes excitatory currents by clamping the membrane near ECl.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Conduction velocity in unmyelinated axons is proportional to the square root of axon diameter. This relationship arises because axoplasmic resistance (Ri) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the axon (which scales with the square of the diameter). Lower Ri means that ionic current generated at the active region of the action potential can flow more easily along the axoplasm, spreading the depolarization farther ahead. The length constant lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri) increases, so subthreshold current reaches threshold at more distant points faster. However, membrane resistance per unit length (Rm) decreases with larger diameter (more membrane area per unit length = more channels = more leakage), partially offsetting the Ri reduction. The net effect gives velocity proportional to sqrt(diameter). This is why the squid giant axon evolved to ~1 mm diameter \u2014 to achieve fast escape responses (~25 m/s) without myelination. Vertebrate myelination achieves even faster conduction (~100 m/s) with much smaller axons.",

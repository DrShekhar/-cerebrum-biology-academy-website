      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Nernst equation for a monovalent cation is: E = (RT/zF) × ln([ion]out/[ion]in). At 37°C, RT/F = 26.7 mV. For K+ (z = +1): EK = 26.7 mV × ln(5/140) = 26.7 mV × ln(0.0357) = 26.7 × (-3.33) = -89 mV, approximately -90 mV. This is very close to the typical resting membrane potential of neurons (-70 mV), reflecting the dominant role of K+ leak channels in setting the resting potential. The slight deviation from EK occurs because the membrane has some permeability to Na+ and Cl-. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation accounts for all permeable ions. In clinical contexts, hyperkalemia (elevated extracellular K+) depolarizes neurons because EK becomes less negative.",

        "Cl- channels open to counteract the depolarization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Voltage-gated Na+ channels have two gating mechanisms: the activation gate (m-gate) that opens rapidly upon depolarization, and the inactivation gate (h-gate) that closes with a slight delay via the 'ball-and-chain' mechanism — an intracellular loop (the inactivation particle, between domains III and IV) swings into the channel pore and blocks it. This fast inactivation occurs within 1-2 ms of channel opening, terminating Na+ influx. Simultaneously, voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, which have slower activation kinetics (delayed rectifier channels), open in response to the same depolarization. The combination of Na+ channel inactivation and K+ channel opening drives repolarization. The Na+/K+ ATPase is too slow (pumping ~100 ions/s vs millions flowing through channels/s) to contribute significantly during the action potential itself; it restores gradients over longer periods.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The GHK voltage equation calculates membrane potential as a weighted average of equilibrium potentials for all permeable ions, with weighting determined by relative permeabilities. At rest, the high K+ permeability dominates, pulling Vm near EK (-90 mV). During the peak of the action potential, voltage-gated Na+ channels open massively, increasing PNa to approximately 20× PK. With PNa now dominant, the membrane potential shifts toward ENa (+55 mV for typical intracellular [Na+] = 15 mM and extracellular [Na+] = 145 mM). The overshoot of the action potential (typically reaching +30 to +40 mV) doesn't quite reach ENa because K+ permeability is not zero and some K+ channels are beginning to open. This demonstrates that the action potential is fundamentally a transient shift in the dominant ionic permeability from K+ to Na+ and back.",

      "explanation": "TTX and saxitoxin are pore-blocking toxins that bind with high affinity to the extracellular vestibule of voltage-gated Na+ channels, specifically near the selectivity filter formed by the P-loops (pore loops) of the four channel domains. These toxins are positively charged guanidinium compounds that physically occlude the ion conduction pathway from the outside, preventing Na+ ions from entering the pore. The binding site is formed by specific glutamate and aspartate residues in the selectivity filter (the DEKA ring in Nav channels). TTX-resistant Na+ channels (like Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 in nociceptors) have amino acid substitutions in this region. Local anesthetics (lidocaine, procaine), in contrast, bind inside the pore from the intracellular side and show use-dependent block. Alpha-scorpion toxins and sea anemone toxins target the voltage sensor (S4 segments) to inhibit inactivation.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Synaptic vesicle fusion is mediated by the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor) complex. The v-SNARE synaptobrevin (VAMP2) on the vesicle membrane forms a four-helix bundle with the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic plasma membrane. This trans-SNARE complex 'zippers' from the N-terminus toward the C-terminal transmembrane domains, pulling the two membranes into close apposition and overcoming the energy barrier for lipid bilayer fusion. The process requires Ca2+ sensing by synaptotagmin-1 (the Ca2+ sensor), which binds Ca2+ through its C2A and C2B domains and interacts with SNAREs and phospholipids to trigger rapid fusion. Complexin acts as a clamp that prevents spontaneous fusion until Ca2+ arrives. Munc18 and Munc13 are essential regulators of SNARE assembly. Clathrin mediates vesicle endocytosis (recycling), and dynamin mediates vesicle scission during endocytosis.",

        "Voltage-gated Na+ channels are in the inactivated state and cannot reopen until they recover through the closed (resting) state upon repolarization",

        "All Na+ ions have been depleted from the extracellular space",
        "The Na+/K+ ATPase is temporarily shut down"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The absolute refractory period is caused by the inactivated state of voltage-gated Na+ channels. After opening (activated state), Na+ channels rapidly transition to the inactivated state via the ball-and-chain mechanism. Inactivated channels CANNOT be reopened by any amount of depolarization — they must first recover to the closed (resting) state, which requires membrane repolarization (or hyperpolarization) to allow the inactivation gate to reset and the activation gate to close. This recovery from inactivation takes 1-2 ms at normal resting potential. During this time, no stimulus, however strong, can elicit an action potential. The relative refractory period follows, during which some Na+ channels have recovered but K+ channels are still open, requiring a stronger-than-normal stimulus. The absolute refractory period ensures unidirectional propagation of action potentials and limits maximum firing frequency.",

        "Myelin increases the concentration of Na+ channels uniformly along the axon",
        "Myelin channels conduct ions directly from node to node through gap junctions",
        "Myelin provides additional ATP to power faster Na+/K+ pump activity",
        "Myelin increases membrane resistance and decreases membrane capacitance in internodal regions, allowing passive current to spread farther and faster to the next node of Ranvier where Na+ channels are clustered"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Myelination by Schwann cells (PNS) or oligodendrocytes (CNS) wraps multiple layers of lipid-rich membrane around the axon at internodal regions. This has two critical biophysical effects: (1) it dramatically increases membrane resistance (Rm), reducing ion leakage across the internodal membrane, and (2) it greatly decreases membrane capacitance (Cm), because the multiple myelin layers act as capacitors in series. The cable equation shows that the length constant (lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri)) increases with higher Rm, meaning passive current spreads farther before decaying. Lower Cm means the membrane charges faster. Together, these effects allow depolarizing current from one node of Ranvier to spread rapidly and with minimal attenuation to the next node (1-2 mm away), where the high density of Nav1.6 channels regenerates the action potential. This 'jumping' of action potentials between nodes is saltatory conduction, increasing speed from ~1 m/s (unmyelinated) to ~100 m/s.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "GABA_A receptors are pentameric ligand-gated Cl- channels (members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, along with glycine, nicotinic ACh, and 5-HT3 receptors). When GABA binds, the channel opens and Cl- flows down its electrochemical gradient. In mature neurons, intracellular Cl- concentration is maintained low (~5 mM) by the KCC2 Cl- transporter (K+-Cl- cotransporter), so ECl is typically around -80 mV. When GABA_A channels open, Cl- flows inward, hyperpolarizing the membrane (classical IPSP). Even when ECl is near resting potential, GABA_A activation provides 'shunting inhibition' — the increased Cl- conductance short-circuits excitatory currents by clamping the membrane near ECl. Notably, in immature neurons, NKCC1 (Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter) maintains high intracellular Cl-, making ECl more positive and GABA excitatory during development. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance GABA_A receptor function.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "NMDA receptors have three unique properties that make them molecular coincidence detectors: (1) They require simultaneous binding of glutamate (and the co-agonist glycine or D-serine) AND postsynaptic depolarization. At resting potential, extracellular Mg2+ ions physically block the channel pore in a voltage-dependent manner. Only when the postsynaptic membrane is sufficiently depolarized (typically by AMPA receptor activation) is the Mg2+ block relieved, allowing ion flow. (2) NMDA receptors are highly permeable to Ca2+ (in addition to Na+ and K+), and this Ca2+ influx activates CaMKII, calcineurin, and other signaling cascades that mediate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). (3) They have slow activation and deactivation kinetics compared to AMPA receptors. CNQX blocks AMPA/kainate receptors; APV/MK-801 block NMDA receptors.

AChE is one of the fastest enzymes known, with a turnover number of ~25,000 molecules per second, ensuring rapid termination of cholinergic signaling. AChE is anchored to the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft at the NMJ via a collagen-like tail (ColQ). The choline produced is recycled back into the presynaptic terminal by the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1/SLC5A7) and used to resynthesize ACh by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). AChE inhibitors include nerve agents (sarin, VX), organophosphate pesticides, and therapeutic drugs (donepezil for Alzheimer's, neostigmine for myasthenia gravis).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Early-phase LTP (E-LTP, lasting 1-3 hours) is triggered by Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors, which activates CaMKII. CaMKII is a holoenzyme of 12 subunits that undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr286 when bound to Ca2+/calmodulin. This autophosphorylation converts CaMKII to a constitutively active state that persists even after Ca2+ levels return to baseline — acting as a molecular 'memory' of the Ca2+ signal. Active CaMKII phosphorylates GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors at Ser831, increasing their single-channel conductance. CaMKII also promotes trafficking of additional AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane from intracellular pools, increasing the number of functional receptors at the synapse. Late-phase LTP (L-LTP, lasting hours to days) additionally requires CREB-dependent gene transcription and new protein synthesis. Endocannabinoids mediate a different form of plasticity (DSI/DSE).",

This direct electrogenic effect contributes approximately -5 to -10 mV to the resting membrane potential (making it slightly more negative). However, the PRIMARY contribution of the pump to the resting potential is indirect — by maintaining the K+ and Na+ concentration gradients that drive passive ion fluxes through leak channels. Without the pump, gradients would dissipate over minutes to hours, and the resting potential would collapse. The resting potential (-70 mV) is mostly determined by the K+ gradient through K+ leak channels (Kir and K2P/TWIK channels), with a small contribution from Na+ permeability. The pump consumes approximately 40-70% of brain ATP, reflecting the enormous metabolic cost of maintaining ionic gradients.",

      "explanation": "Synaptotagmin-1 has two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that each bind Ca2+ ions (3 Ca2+ ions to C2A, 2 to C2B). Ca2+ binding neutralizes the negative charges of the aspartate residues in the Ca2+-binding loops, allowing these loops to penetrate the negatively charged plasma membrane (particularly PS-containing leaflets). This membrane insertion brings the vesicle and plasma membrane into closer proximity. Simultaneously, Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin interacts with the SNARE complex, particularly displacing the clamp protein complexin, which normally prevents the SNARE complex from completing the final steps of fusion. This releases the SNAREs to complete zippering and drive membrane merger. The dual requirement for membrane binding and SNARE interaction explains the remarkable speed (sub-millisecond) and Ca2+ cooperativity (Hill coefficient ~4-5) of neurotransmitter release.

      "explanation": "Demyelination has devastating effects on action potential propagation for several reasons: (1) Membrane resistance (Rm) decreases in demyelinated regions because ion channels and aqueous cytoplasm are exposed, causing current leakage. (2) Membrane capacitance (Cm) increases because the insulating myelin layers are removed. (3) The length constant decreases dramatically, meaning passive current decays over much shorter distances. Since nodes of Ranvier are spaced 1-2 mm apart (optimized for myelinated conduction), the weakened passive current cannot reliably depolarize the next node to threshold. This results in conduction block — the action potential fails to propagate past the demyelinated segment. Even partial demyelination slows conduction dramatically. Clinical symptoms of MS (optic neuritis, weakness, numbness, ataxia) reflect conduction failure in different CNS pathways. Remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells can partially restore function.",

The requirement for two ACh molecules creates a sigmoidal dose-response curve and ensures that the channel opens only when ACh concentration is sufficiently high. Tubocurarine (curare) is a competitive antagonist that blocks ACh binding at these sites. Alpha-bungarotoxin from banded krait binds irreversibly to the alpha subunit binding site.",

When the extracellular K+ concentration is increased from 5 mM to 20 mM (while intracellular K+ remains 140 mM), the membrane potential depolarizes to -50 mV. Using the Nernst equation, the predicted EK at 20 mM extracellular K+ is approximately -52 mV. Why is the measured potential (-50 mV) slightly more positive than the predicted EK?",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The measured membrane potential is slightly more positive than the predicted EK because the membrane is not exclusively permeable to K+. Even at rest, the membrane has a small but non-zero permeability to Na+ (PNa/PK approximately 0.04 at rest). Since ENa is approximately +55 mV, even a small Na+ permeability pulls the membrane potential positive from EK. The Goldman equation accounts for this: Vm = (RT/F) × ln[(PK[K]out + PNa[Na]out + PCl[Cl]in) / (PK[K]in + PNa[Na]in + PCl[Cl]out)]. At elevated extracellular K+ (20 mM), EK becomes -52 mV, but the Na+ contribution shifts Vm to -50 mV. Notably, when extracellular K+ is raised to very high levels (>50 mM), the membrane potential closely matches EK because K+ conductance completely dominates. This experiment demonstrates that K+ is the dominant but not exclusive ion determining resting Vm.",

The voltage-clamp technique holds the membrane at a set voltage, preventing the normal positive feedback, and measures the net current flowing through ion channels. At 0 mV: (1) The fast inward current is carried by Na+ through voltage-gated Na+ channels — it is inward because 0 mV is below ENa (+55 mV), so Na+ flows in. It peaks rapidly (~1 ms) due to fast activation, then decays due to fast inactivation of Na+ channels. Replacing extracellular Na+ with impermeant choline eliminates the Na+ driving force and the current disappears. (2) The sustained outward current is carried by K+ through delayed rectifier K+ channels — it is outward because 0 mV is above EK (-90 mV), so K+ flows out. K+ current is unaffected by Na+ removal.

Since Kv channels are tetramers, expressing a pore-dead Kv4.2 mutant (e.g., with a GYG→AAA mutation in the selectivity filter) that co-assembles with endogenous Kv4.2 subunits produces non-functional heteromeric channels. Because Kv4.2 preferentially assembles with itself (subfamily-specific assembly), the dominant-negative selectively targets Kv4.2-containing channels without affecting other Kv families (Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, Kv7). Alternative specific approaches include: conditional genetic knockout (Cre-lox), shRNA knockdown, or genetically-encoded toxins. Pharmacological blockers like TEA (blocks most Kv channels and BK channels) and 4-AP (blocks Kv1, Kv3, and Kv4 families) lack the required specificity.

The toxin enters presynaptic terminals via receptor-mediated endocytosis (binding to gangliosides and SV2 or synaptotagmin), then the light chain translocates to the cytosol where it cleaves its SNARE target. Without functional SNAREs, synaptic vesicles cannot fuse with the plasma membrane, completely blocking neurotransmitter release.

(2) Virtually instantaneous transmission — no synaptic delay because there is no vesicle fusion, diffusion, or receptor binding required. Chemical synapses have 0.5-5 ms delay. (3) Limited signal amplification — the postsynaptic response is typically smaller than the presynaptic signal due to the coupling ratio. Chemical synapses can amplify signals through neurotransmitter release and receptor-mediated ion channel opening. (4) Limited plasticity — though gap junction conductance can be modulated by pH, Ca2+, voltage, and phosphorylation, the range of modulation is less than chemical synapses.

DAT is a Na+/Cl--dependent transporter that normally cotransports one dopamine molecule with two Na+ and one Cl- ion back into the presynaptic terminal. Cocaine binds to a site overlapping with the dopamine-binding site, competitively blocking transport. While cocaine also blocks SERT and NET (contributing to its sympathomimetic effects), DAT blockade is most strongly correlated with its reinforcing properties, as demonstrated by DAT knockout mice that show reduced cocaine self-administration.

      "explanation": "This Nobel Prize-winning insight (Roderick MacKinnon, 2003) revealed that the K+ channel selectivity filter (formed by the GYG/GFG signature sequence from each of four subunits) contains a precisely spaced array of backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms. These oxygens are positioned to provide an energetically favorable replacement for K+'s waters of hydration — K+ ions pass through the filter in single file, perfectly coordinated by 8 carbonyl oxygens at each of 4 binding sites. For K+ (1.33 A radius), the energy of dehydration is exactly compensated by the energy of coordination with carbonyls, making transit energetically neutral. Na+ (0.95 A) is too small to make optimal contact with all the carbonyls simultaneously, so the coordination energy cannot compensate for dehydration energy — Na+ passage is energetically unfavorable.

The mean open time reflects the intrinsic rate constant for channel closing (alpha), which is a property of the channel-agonist complex and is independent of agonist concentration — once the channel is open, agonist concentration doesn't affect how long it stays open (mean open time = 1/alpha). The mean closed time reflects the time between channel openings, which depends on the rate of agonist binding (a concentration-dependent process): at higher ACh concentrations, ACh molecules bind to the receptor more frequently (the on-rate = kon × [ACh] increases), reducing the waiting time between openings. This manifests as decreased mean closed time and increased channel open probability (Po) at higher concentrations. At saturating concentrations, Po approaches maximum.

If the summed depolarization reaches threshold at the axon hillock (which has the lowest threshold due to the highest density of Nav channels), an action potential is generated. Temporal summation occurs when a single presynaptic neuron fires repeatedly at high frequency, so that each subsequent EPSP arrives before the previous one has fully decayed (the membrane time constant determines how quickly EPSPs decay).

VGLUTs primarily use the delta-psi (electrical) component of the gradient as the driving force, exchanging luminal H+ for cytoplasmic glutamate (acting as a glutamate/H+ exchanger). This contrasts with vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT), which rely more heavily on the delta-pH component. Disrupting the V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 collapses the proton gradient and blocks vesicular glutamate loading, ultimately inhibiting glutamatergic transmission.

Voltage-clamp recording provides additional mechanistic information: the reversal potential of the peptide-induced current indicates which ions carry the current (reversal near 0 mV suggests a non-selective cation current/excitatory; reversal near ECl suggests Cl- channel/inhibitory; reversal near EK suggests K+ channel/inhibitory).

This is one of the fastest GPCR-mediated effects because it involves direct channel gating by beta-gamma (membrane-delimited signaling) rather than a second messenger cascade.

      "explanation": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the predominant pathway for synaptic vesicle recycling at most central synapses during moderate stimulation. After full fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane, the vesicle proteins and membrane are retrieved by: (1) adaptor proteins (AP-2, AP180/CALM, stonin-2) recognizing vesicle protein sorting signals; (2) clathrin triskelions assembling into a lattice around the coated pit; (3) dynamin GTPase assembling as a collar around the neck and catalyzing membrane scission upon GTP hydrolysis; (4) auxilin/GAK recruiting Hsc70 to uncoat the clathrin. The recycled vesicle is then acidified by V-ATPase and refilled with neurotransmitter. Kiss-and-run occurs but is less prevalent. During intense stimulation, activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) retrieves large membrane portions that are later processed into individual vesicles via endosomal sorting. Synaptojanin (a phosphoinositide phosphatase) and endophilin are also essential for CME at synapses.",

      "explanation": "Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are lipid-derived retrograde messengers synthesized on demand from postsynaptic membrane phospholipids. 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol, the primary eCB at most synapses) is produced by diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLalpha) in response to postsynaptic depolarization and/or mGluR activation that elevates Ca2+ and activates PLCbeta. Being lipophilic, eCBs diffuse retrogradely across the synaptic cleft without vesicular release. They activate presynaptic CB1 receptors (Gi/o-coupled GPCRs), which inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (N-type and P/Q-type) and activate GIRK channels, reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx and neurotransmitter release probability. This mediates depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) at GABAergic synapses and depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) at glutamatergic synapses.

Classical small-molecule transmitters (glutamate, GABA, ACh, catecholamines) are synthesized locally in presynaptic terminals by cytoplasmic enzymes, loaded into small synaptic vesicles (SSVs, ~40 nm) by vesicular transporters, and released from the active zone by single action potentials. In contrast, neuropeptides are gene products that are transcribed in the nucleus, translated on rough ER, processed in the Golgi, and packaged into large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs, 80-200 nm) in the cell body. LDCVs are then transported to terminals by fast axonal transport (kinesin motors, ~1 um/s). Neuropeptide release typically requires high-frequency or burst firing to produce sufficient Ca2+ accumulation, and LDCVs fuse at perisynaptic/extrasynaptic sites (not restricted to active zones). Neuropeptides are inactivated by extracellular peptidases, not reuptake, and cannot be locally recycled.",

A higher Rm (less membrane leakage) allows current to travel farther before leaking out. A lower Ri (less axoplasmic resistance, achieved by larger axon diameter) allows current to flow more easily along the axon. For unmyelinated axons, lambda is typically 0.1-1 mm. Myelination dramatically increases Rm (and reduces Cm), increasing lambda to 1-2 mm (matching internode distance). The time constant (tau = Rm × Cm) determines how quickly the membrane charges/discharges but is not the length constant.

      "explanation": "Excitotoxicity is primarily mediated by Ca2+ overload. During ischemia (stroke) or trauma, excessive glutamate accumulates in the extracellular space (due to energy failure preventing reuptake by EAATs and causing reversed glutamate transport). Sustained activation of NMDA receptors (and AMPA receptors in neurons expressing Ca2+-permeable AMPA-Rs lacking GluA2) causes massive Ca2+ influx. Excessive intracellular Ca2+ activates destructive enzymes: (1) calpains (Ca2+-dependent proteases) that degrade cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules; (2) phospholipase A2 that releases arachidonic acid, generating inflammatory prostaglandins and free radicals; (3) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) producing NO, which combines with superoxide to form peroxynitrite; (4) mitochondrial Ca2+ overload triggers the permeability transition pore, releasing cytochrome c and initiating apoptosis.

The m variable (activation) ranges from 0 to 1 and increases rapidly with depolarization (fast kinetics, tau_m ~0.1-0.5 ms). The cubic power m³ reflects that three independent activation 'gates' must all be open simultaneously. The h variable (inactivation) ranges from 1 (all gates open) to 0 (all gates closed) and decreases with depolarization but with slower kinetics (tau_h ~1-5 ms). The channel conducts only when m³ × h > 0 — that is, when all activation gates are open AND the inactivation gate has not yet closed. This mathematical formulation beautifully captures the transient nature of Na+ current: upon depolarization, m rises fast (channel opens) but h falls slowly (channel inactivates). K+ conductance is modeled as gK = gK_max × n⁴ (four activation gates, no inactivation). Modern structural data confirms ~3-4 voltage sensors in the channel.",

      "options": [
        "m = 20 quanta; the reduction is due to decreased vesicle size",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Quantal content m = EPP amplitude / mEPP amplitude = 40 mV / 0.5 mV = 80 quanta released per nerve impulse. This means approximately 80 synaptic vesicles fuse simultaneously during a normal nerve impulse. When quantal content drops to 20 (EPP = 10 mV) but mEPP amplitude remains 0.5 mV, this indicates a presynaptic defect. Each individual vesicle still produces a normal response (mEPP = 0.5 mV, meaning postsynaptic receptors are functioning normally), but fewer vesicles are released per impulse. This pattern is characteristic of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), where autoantibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels reduce Ca2+ influx and vesicle release. In contrast, myasthenia gravis (autoantibodies against nAChRs) reduces mEPP amplitude because fewer functional receptors are available, but quantal content may be normal or even increased compensatorily.",

GlyRs are particularly important in spinal cord motor circuits and brainstem auditory pathways.

Hyperekplexia (startle disease) results from loss-of-function mutations in GlyR alpha1 or beta subunits, or in the glycine transporter GlyT2.

During sensitization, serotonergic facilitatory interneurons release 5-HT onto the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. 5-HT activates Gs-coupled metabotropic receptors, stimulating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP. cAMP activates PKA (protein kinase A), which: (1) phosphorylates and closes certain K+ channels (S-type K+ channels), reducing K+ efflux and broadening the presynaptic action potential. A wider action potential keeps voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open longer, allowing more Ca2+ influx. (2) PKA also directly enhances the vesicle release machinery (phosphorylating synapsin and other release proteins), increasing the probability of vesicle fusion for a given Ca2+ signal.

      "explanation": "GABA_A receptors conduct Cl- ions, and the direction of Cl- flux depends on the relationship between the membrane potential and ECl. With ECl = -80 mV: At the resting potential (-70 mV), Vm is above ECl, so opening Cl- channels drives Cl- inward (hyperpolarizing from -70 to -75 mV, producing a small IPSP). At -60 mV (depolarized by current injection), Vm is even further above ECl, so there is a larger driving force for Cl- influx. GABA application will hyperpolarize the membrane from -60 mV toward ECl (-80 mV), producing a significant IPSP. If the membrane were at exactly -80 mV (= ECl), GABA would produce no voltage change (reversal potential). If the membrane were below -80 mV, GABA would actually depolarize the membrane toward ECl. This illustrates shunting inhibition — even without voltage change, the increased Cl- conductance opposes excitatory currents by clamping the membrane near ECl.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Conduction velocity in unmyelinated axons is proportional to the square root of axon diameter. This relationship arises because axoplasmic resistance (Ri) is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the axon (which scales with the square of the diameter). Lower Ri means that ionic current generated at the active region of the action potential can flow more easily along the axoplasm, spreading the depolarization farther ahead. The length constant lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri) increases, so subthreshold current reaches threshold at more distant points faster. However, membrane resistance per unit length (Rm) decreases with larger diameter (more membrane area per unit length = more channels = more leakage), partially offsetting the Ri reduction. The net effect gives velocity proportional to sqrt(diameter). This is why the squid giant axon evolved to ~1 mm diameter — to achieve fast escape responses (~25 m/s) without myelination. Vertebrate myelination achieves even faster conduction (~100 m/s) with much smaller axons.",

PSD-95 recruits a dense network of signaling molecules including nNOS, SynGAP (Ras-GAP), SPAR, Shank, and others, creating a signaling microdomain at the synapse.

(2) LAs bind with higher affinity to inactivated channels and stabilize them in the inactivated state. (3) During repetitive firing, more channels cycle through open/inactivated states, allowing more drug binding and progressive accumulation of block. This is clinically advantageous because rapidly firing nociceptive (pain) neurons are blocked preferentially while slowly firing motor neurons are relatively spared, producing selective pain relief at appropriate doses.",

After the first action potential, Ca2+ enters through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and triggers vesicle fusion. Ca2+ is then removed by the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), and mitochondrial uptake, but this clearance takes tens of milliseconds. If a second action potential arrives before Ca2+ has fully returned to baseline, the new Ca2+ influx adds to the residual Ca2+, producing a larger peak Ca2+ concentration. Because neurotransmitter release has a highly cooperative relationship with Ca2+ (approximately fourth-power dependence), even a modest increase in peak Ca2+ substantially increases release probability. PPF is most prominent at synapses with initially low release probability (Pr). Synaptic depression, conversely, occurs at high-Pr synapses due to depletion of the readily releasable vesicle pool.",

When GABA_A channels open in immature neurons, Cl- flows outward (down its electrochemical gradient), depolarizing the membrane. This depolarization can activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, providing Ca2+ signals important for neuronal migration, synapse formation, and circuit maturation. During postnatal development, KCC2 expression is strongly upregulated (driven by BDNF signaling and neuronal activity), lowering intracellular Cl- to ~5 mM and shifting ECl to approximately -80 mV.

(2) A CaMKII-CreERT2 transgenic line expressing Cre recombinase fused to a modified estrogen receptor (ERT2) under the CaMKII-alpha promoter (active in forebrain excitatory neurons). CreERT2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm until tamoxifen administration causes nuclear translocation, where Cre excises the floxed gene. (3) Tamoxifen is administered in adulthood, allowing normal development before gene deletion. After a suitable washout period, mice undergo behavioral testing (Morris water maze, contextual fear conditioning) to assess learning/memory. Controls include floxed-only mice (no Cre) and oil-injected CreERT2 mice. Global knockouts may be embryonic lethal or cause developmental compensation.",

(1) APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate), a specific NMDA receptor antagonist, blocks Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors. The fraction of the Ca2+ transient eliminated by APV represents the NMDA receptor contribution. (2) Adding voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers (Cd2+ for non-selective block, or specific blockers: nimodipine for L-type, omega-agatoxin for P/Q-type, omega-conotoxin for N-type) in the presence of APV reveals the VGCC contribution. (3) Thapsigargin irreversibly inhibits SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase), depleting ER Ca2+ stores over time. Any remaining Ca2+ signal sensitive to thapsigargin represents Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from internal stores.

However, their different clinical effects arise from different sites of action: Botulinum toxin (BoNT) acts locally at the neuromuscular junction, blocking ACh release from motor neuron terminals, causing flaccid paralysis (no muscle contraction). Tetanus toxin (TeNT) enters motor neuron terminals at the NMJ but is then transported retrogradely (via dynein) to the cell body in the spinal cord. From there, it undergoes transcytosis into inhibitory (glycinergic and GABAergic) interneuron terminals, where it cleaves VAMP2 (synaptobrevin-2). This blocks inhibitory neurotransmitter release, removing inhibition from motor neurons and causing uncontrolled, sustained muscle contraction (spastic paralysis, tetanic spasms). Both toxins actually cleave synaptobrevin, but their trafficking determines the clinical phenotype.",

      "explanation": "Dendritic spines (0.5-2 um in length) have a bulbous head connected to the dendritic shaft by a thin neck (50-200 nm diameter). The narrow neck serves critical compartmentalization functions: (1) Biochemical compartmentalization — the neck restricts diffusion of signaling molecules (Ca2+, activated CaMKII, Ras, cAMP) generated at the synapse, confining them to the individual spine head. This enables synapse-specific plasticity: one spine can undergo LTP while adjacent spines are unaffected. (2) Electrical compartmentalization — the high resistance of the narrow neck creates a voltage compartment, meaning EPSPs generated at the spine head are attenuated (filtered) as they spread to the dendrite. This may allow local voltage-dependent processes (NMDA receptor unblock) at individual spines. Spine morphology is dynamic: LTP causes spine enlargement (mushroom spines), while LTD causes spine shrinkage.

Ca2+ elevations trigger release of gliotransmitters: (1) D-serine, an NMDA receptor co-agonist that modulates LTP; (2) glutamate, which can activate presynaptic mGluRs and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors; (3) ATP/adenosine, which modulates presynaptic release via P2Y and A1 receptors. Astrocytes also provide essential homeostatic functions: glutamate uptake (EAAT1/2), K+ buffering (Kir4.1 channels), and regulation of extracellular volume.

When chronic activity is reduced (TTX block, sensory deprivation), neurons upregulate postsynaptic AMPA receptor expression at all excitatory synapses multiplicatively — each synapse's strength is scaled up by a common factor, preserving the relative differences between synapses (unlike Hebbian plasticity which changes specific synapses). The mechanisms involve: (1) increased GluA1/GluA2 surface expression through TNF-alpha signaling and Arc/Arg3.1 downregulation; (2) increased mEPSC (miniature EPSC) amplitude; (3) decreased GABA_A receptor surface expression (scaling down inhibition). Conversely, chronically elevated activity triggers scaling down (reduced AMPA receptors, increased inhibition). This bidirectional scaling maintains firing rates within a functional range. The set point is thought to involve Ca2+-dependent sensors and transcription factors (CREB, MeCP2). Disrupted homeostatic plasticity may contribute to epilepsy and autism.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",

(2) Postsynaptic depolarization — the postsynaptic membrane must be sufficiently depolarized to expel the Mg2+ ion that blocks the channel pore at resting potential. This typically requires concurrent AMPA receptor activation at the same or nearby synapses. Only when both conditions are met does Ca2+ flow through the NMDA receptor, triggering LTP. This implements Hebb's rule: synapses where the presynaptic neuron contributes to firing the postsynaptic neuron are selectively strengthened. Synapses where presynaptic activity occurs without sufficient postsynaptic depolarization do not activate NMDA receptors and are not potentiated. This associative property is fundamental to learning, memory formation, and activity-dependent circuit refinement during development.",

They bind to a specific site located at the interface between alpha (alpha1, 2, 3, or 5, NOT alpha4 or alpha6) and gamma2 subunits — distinct from the GABA binding site (between alpha and beta subunits). Benzodiazepine binding enhances GABA's ability to open the channel by increasing the frequency of channel opening events (without affecting single-channel conductance or mean open time). Critically, benzodiazepines have no effect in the absence of GABA — they are pure modulators, not direct agonists, which limits their maximum effect and provides a safety margin compared to barbiturates (which increase open duration and CAN directly open channels at high doses). Different alpha subunit combinations confer different pharmacological effects: alpha1 (sedation/amnesia), alpha2/3 (anxiolysis), alpha5 (memory).

Ephaptic effects are particularly significant in: (1) myelinated nerve bundles where paranodal currents from one fiber can affect neighbors; (2) densely packed cortical/hippocampal pyramidal cell layers; (3) the cerebellum (Purkinje-basket cell interactions).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "AMPA receptor desensitization is an intrinsic conformational transition of the receptor protein. Each GluA subunit has a bilobed ligand-binding domain (LBD) that clamps shut upon glutamate binding. In the resting state, the LBD dimer interface (between adjacent subunits) is stable. Upon glutamate binding and channel opening, strain accumulates at the dimer interface. Within milliseconds, the dimer interface ruptures, allowing the LBDs to rotate and rearrange, which decouples ligand binding from channel gating — the pore closes even though glutamate is still bound. This is desensitization (distinct from deactivation, which occurs when glutamate unbinds). The rate of desensitization is extremely fast for AMPA receptors (~1-10 ms), which is important for shaping the time course of synaptic currents. Cyclothiazide (a positive allosteric modulator) blocks desensitization by stabilizing the LBD dimer interface. The drug perampanel is a negative allosteric modulator used to treat epilepsy.

During sustained activity, elevated Ca2+ activates CaMKII and CaMKIV, which phosphorylate synapsin at multiple sites (Ser566, Ser603), reducing its affinity for both vesicles and actin. This releases reserve vesicles, which then dock and prime at active zones to refill the RRP. CDK5 also phosphorylates synapsin. (2) Vesicle recycling: After exocytosis, vesicle membrane is retrieved by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and recycled vesicles are re-acidified and refilled with neurotransmitter by the V-ATPase and vesicular transporters before re-entering the RRP.

The reversal potential (Erev) for the EPP is approximately -5 to 0 mV (approximately midway between ENa of +55 mV and EK of -90 mV). Since the muscle fiber resting potential is approximately -90 mV, which is far below Erev, there is always a large inward driving force when nAChRs open. Na+ influx dominates (because of the larger electrochemical gradient for Na+ at -90 mV), producing a robust depolarization (EPP typically 40-70 mV, well above the ~-50 mV threshold for muscle action potential). The EPP has a large safety factor — even if 70% of receptors are blocked (as in mild myasthenia gravis), the remaining EPP still reaches threshold.

      "explanation": "Alpha-latrotoxin (alpha-LTX) from Latrodectus spiders binds to presynaptic receptors (neurexin and latrophilin/CIRL) and inserts into the presynaptic membrane, forming Ca2+-permeable pores (tetrameric channels). This has two consequences: (1) Ca2+-dependent mechanism: Ca2+ influx through the alpha-LTX pores triggers massive vesicle exocytosis through the normal synaptotagmin-SNARE machinery. (2) Ca2+-independent mechanism: Alpha-LTX can stimulate release even in Ca2+-free conditions, likely through direct interaction with the SNARE/Munc18/Munc13 machinery and by mechanical membrane deformation. The result is explosive, uncontrolled neurotransmitter release that depletes all vesicle pools, initially causing intense muscle contraction (from ACh flood at NMJs) followed by paralysis (from vesicle depletion). Clinically, black widow spider bites cause intense pain, muscle spasms, and autonomic dysfunction. Alpha-LTX has been invaluable as a research tool for studying vesicle release mechanisms.",

By blocking SERT, SSRIs increase the concentration and duration of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, enhancing serotonergic transmission. SSRIs show high selectivity for SERT over other monoamine transporters (DAT, NET), unlike older tricyclic antidepressants that block multiple transporters. However, there is a therapeutic delay of 2-4 weeks before clinical improvement, suggesting that the acute increase in 5-HT levels triggers downstream adaptive changes: initially, increased 5-HT activates inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors on raphe neurons, reducing firing. Over weeks, autoreceptors desensitize, firing increases, and downstream receptor adaptations (BDNF upregulation, neurogenesis, receptor sensitization changes) produce the antidepressant effect. MAOIs are a different class that prevent intracellular 5-HT degradation.",

The Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2, discovered by Ardem Patapoutian, Nobel Prize 2021) are key mechanotransduction channels. Piezo2 is essential for light touch sensation and proprioception. These are large trimeric channels with unique propeller-like structure (~38 transmembrane segments per subunit) that respond to membrane tension by conformational change, opening a central non-selective cation pore permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+. The resulting depolarizing receptor potential (generator potential) is graded — proportional to stimulus intensity. If the receptor potential reaches threshold at the first node of Ranvier, it triggers action potentials. The Pacinian corpuscle's layered onion-like capsule provides rapid adaptation by filtering sustained pressure into onset/offset transients.

The mechanism involves slow K+ currents that build up during repetitive firing: (1) Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels, activated by Ca2+/calmodulin; BK channels, activated by Ca2+ and voltage) open as intracellular Ca2+ accumulates from repeated action potentials. These channels generate the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) and medium AHP (mAHP) that follow each spike, and their cumulative effect progressively raises the inter-spike interval. (2) M-type K+ channels (Kv7.2/Kv7.3, KCNQ2/3), slow voltage-gated K+ channels that activate near threshold and generate a persistent outward current (M-current) that opposes depolarization. (3) Na+ channel slow inactivation also contributes over seconds, reducing the available Na+ channel pool. The balance of these mechanisms varies by neuron type — fast-spiking interneurons show minimal adaptation (due to Kv3 channels enabling fast recovery), while pyramidal neurons show prominent adaptation.",

Each release site has a probability p of releasing a vesicle for each action potential. At central synapses, p (release probability) is typically 0.1-0.5 per release site. (2) Quantal amplitude: The clustering of EPSP amplitudes at multiples of ~0.4 mV indicates that each released vesicle (quantum) contributes approximately 0.4 mV to the EPSP. When 1 vesicle fuses: 0.4 mV; 2 vesicles: 0.8 mV; 3 vesicles: 1.2 mV; etc. The amplitude histogram shows peaks at these quantal multiples (Poisson distribution).

When myelin is lost, paranodal junctions are disrupted, and Kv1 channels redistribute laterally into the now-exposed internodal membrane. These exposed Kv1 channels activate during the action potential, conducting K+ outward and opposing the depolarizing Na+ current. In partially demyelinated nerves, the reduced membrane resistance already weakens passive current spread; the additional K+ shunt from exposed Kv1 channels further reduces the safety factor below 1, causing conduction block. 4-aminopyridine blocks Kv1 channels, removing this opposing K+ current and partially restoring the safety factor, allowing (slowed) action potential propagation. 4-AP (dalfampridine/Ampyra) is FDA-approved for improving walking in multiple sclerosis patients.

At exactly Erev, the net synaptic current is zero because there is no net driving force on the permeant ions.

At high-Pr synapses (type Y): Many vesicles fuse on the first pulse, significantly depleting the RRP. Even though residual Ca2+ may increase Pr slightly, the reduced number of available vesicles dominates, producing a smaller second EPSC (PPR < 1 = depression).

      "explanation": "Organophosphate nerve agents (sarin, tabun, soman, VX) are potent irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). They covalently phosphorylate the catalytic serine residue (Ser203 in human AChE) in the enzyme's active site, permanently inactivating it. Without AChE to degrade ACh, ACh accumulates at all cholinergic synapses: (1) NMJ: Sustained depolarization block → skeletal muscle paralysis, including respiratory muscles; (2) Parasympathetic effectors: Excessive glandular secretions (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation = SLUDGE), bronchospasm, bradycardia; (3) CNS: Seizures, unconsciousness. Death typically results from respiratory failure (diaphragm paralysis + bronchospasm + excessive secretions). Treatment includes: atropine (competitive muscarinic antagonist to block parasympathetic effects), pralidoxime/2-PAM (nucleophilic oxime that can reactivate phosphorylated AChE if given before 'aging'), and diazepam (for seizures). After 'aging' (loss of alkyl group from phosphorylated serine), the enzyme is permanently inactivated.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The neuromuscular junction is designed for reliable, fail-safe transmission through multiple redundant mechanisms: (1) High quantal content: Each nerve impulse releases 50-300 synaptic vesicles (quanta) simultaneously from hundreds of active zones, producing a large EPP (typically 40-70 mV). (2) High receptor density: nAChRs are concentrated at ~10,000 receptors/um² on the crests of junctional folds (maintained by agrin-MuSK-rapsyn signaling), ensuring maximum responsiveness to released ACh. (3) Junctional folds: The postsynaptic membrane is folded, with nAChRs on the crests and voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav1.4) concentrated in the troughs, positioning them to be activated by the EPP. (4) High AChE activity: Rapid ACh degradation prevents receptor desensitization from prolonged ACh exposure. The safety factor (~3-4x) means the EPP exceeds threshold by 3-4 fold.

They activate slowly at potentials below -50 to -60 mV and conduct a mixed Na+/K+ current (Erev approximately -30 mV). Because Erev is above resting potential, Ih activation during hyperpolarization produces an inward depolarizing current that opposes and limits the hyperpolarization. This gives HCN channels a critical role in: (1) Pacemaking: In cardiac sinoatrial node cells and thalamic relay neurons, Ih produces the slow depolarization between beats/bursts; (2) Setting resting potential: Ih depolarizes neurons from EK toward firing threshold; (3) Dendritic integration: Ih in dendrites normalizes the temporal summation of distal EPSPs. cAMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) shifts the activation curve positive, linking neuromodulation (via Gs-coupled receptors → cAMP) to pacemaker frequency.

Uniquely, kainate receptors also signal through a non-canonical metabotropic pathway involving Gi/Go proteins, which can modulate transmitter release and membrane excitability. Key roles include: (1) Presynaptic modulation at both excitatory (reducing glutamate release at high agonist concentrations) and inhibitory (reducing GABA release at hippocampal interneuron synapses) terminals; (2) Contribution to slow EPSCs at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses; (3) Regulation of neuronal excitability by inhibiting the slow afterhyperpolarization.

      "explanation": "The voltage-dependent Mg2+ block is mediated by a specific binding site within the NMDA receptor channel pore. Mg2+ ions (~1 mM extracellular) enter the pore from the outside and bind at the 'N+1 site' — a narrow constriction formed by asparagine residues in the M2 re-entrant pore loop of each GluN2 subunit (and corresponding sites on GluN1 subunits). At resting potentials (-70 mV), the strong inward electrical field drives Mg2+ deep into the pore but it cannot pass through the narrow selectivity region, becoming trapped and blocking the channel. As the membrane depolarizes, the electrical driving force on Mg2+ decreases, and at potentials above -40 to -20 mV, Mg2+ is expelled from the pore (primarily outward into the cytoplasm), relieving the block. This voltage-dependent relief of block creates the characteristic region of negative slope conductance in the NMDA receptor I-V curve. GluN2A subunits show stronger Mg2+ block than GluN2C/2D, contributing to subunit-dependent differences in NMDA receptor function.",

Once considered rare curiosities, autapses are now recognized as relatively common, particularly in cortical and hippocampal fast-spiking interneurons. Excitatory autapses (on principal neurons) provide positive feedback that can reinforce and prolong firing. Inhibitory autapses (on GABAergic interneurons, which are the most well-studied) provide negative feedback that sharpens spike timing and contributes to gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz). In fast-spiking basket cells, inhibitory autapses through GABA_A receptors limit the number of spikes in a burst and help regulate the precise timing of inhibitory output to the circuit. Computational models suggest autapses can stabilize network dynamics and prevent epileptiform activity.

The key points: (1) Because Ca2+ is divalent (z = 2), the prefactor is halved compared to monovalent ions (26.7/2 = 13.35 mV instead of 26.7 mV). (2) The enormous concentration gradient (20,000:1 ratio, compared to ~30:1 for Na+) produces a very positive equilibrium potential. This means the electrochemical driving force on Ca2+ is very large at all physiological membrane potentials — both the concentration gradient and electrical gradient drive Ca2+ inward.

Monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) are prime examples: they are often released from varicosities (non-junctional release sites along axons) and can diffuse >100 um to act on extrasynaptic receptors on multiple cell types (neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels). Volume transmission produces slower, longer-lasting, and more diffuse effects compared to 'wired transmission' (classical point-to-point synaptic transmission with <50 nm cleft width).

      "explanation": "The squid giant axon (~500-1000 um diameter) was an evolutionary solution to the need for fast conduction to power the jet-propelled escape response, achieved without myelination. The biophysical advantage of large diameter lies in reducing axoplasmic resistance: Ri is proportional to 1/cross-sectional area (= 1/pi*r²), so a 500 um axon has ~10,000 times lower Ri than a 5 um axon. The length constant (lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri)) increases dramatically, allowing passive current from one active region to spread farther and faster, regenerating the action potential at more distant points. The squid giant axon achieves ~25 m/s — adequate for an escape response. However, this is inefficient in terms of space and metabolic cost. Vertebrate myelination achieves even faster speeds (~100 m/s) with axons only 10-20 um diameter, by increasing Rm and decreasing Cm at internodes.

The key channel enabling burst firing is the T-type (transient, low-threshold) Ca2+ channel (Cav3.1/3.2/3.3). T-type channels have unique biophysics: they activate at relatively negative potentials (-65 to -40 mV, hence 'low-voltage activated'), rapidly inactivate, and recover from inactivation (deinactivate) only during hyperpolarization below -70 mV. When a neuron is hyperpolarized (e.g., by GABA inhibition), T-type channels deinactivate. Upon return toward threshold, T-type channels open, generating a broad low-threshold Ca2+ spike that carries a burst of Na+ action potentials on its crest. This is critical for: thalamic relay neurons (burst mode during sleep, tonic mode during wakefulness), rhythmic oscillations (delta, spindle waves), and hippocampal burst firing that enhances synaptic plasticity.

At the soma/axon hillock, these graded depolarizations interact with the threshold mechanism: Below threshold: The depolarization spreads passively and decays without generating an AP. Above threshold: Each time the membrane reaches threshold, an AP is generated (all-or-none, constant amplitude). Higher stimulus intensity produces larger depolarization, which reaches threshold more quickly after each AP (shorter interspike interval), resulting in higher firing frequency. This rate coding is the primary way neurons encode stimulus intensity — stronger stimuli produce higher firing rates, not larger APs.

However, they produce temporally distinct current components: (1) AMPA component (fast): Rapidly activated, produces peak current within ~1 ms, and decays quickly (~3-5 ms). Mediates the bulk of fast synaptic transmission and determines whether the postsynaptic cell reaches threshold. Blocked by CNQX/NBQX. (2) NMDA component (slow): Activates more slowly (partially due to slower channel kinetics and voltage-dependent Mg2+ block relief), produces a smaller peak but sustained current lasting ~100-200 ms. At -70 mV holding potential, the Mg2+ block is largely relieved by the voltage clamp, revealing the full NMDA current. Blocked by APV/MK-801. The NMDA component provides the Ca2+ signal for synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD). This dual receptor system allows the same synapse to mediate both fast transmission and long-term plasticity.",

      "question": "A neuroscientist records intracellular potentials from a postsynaptic neuron while stimulating presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Stimulating the excitatory input alone produces a 10 mV EPSP. Stimulating the inhibitory input alone produces no visible change in membrane potential (the cell stays at -70 mV, and ECl = -70 mV). However, when both inputs are stimulated simultaneously, the EPSP amplitude is reduced to only 5 mV. How does the inhibitory input reduce the EPSP without producing a visible IPSP?",
      "options": [
        "The inhibitory input causes presynaptic inhibition of the excitatory terminal",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This demonstrates shunting inhibition (also called 'divisive inhibition' or 'silent inhibition'), a powerful form of synaptic inhibition that operates without producing a visible IPSP. When ECl equals the resting potential (ECl = Vm = -70 mV), opening GABA_A (or glycine) Cl- channels produces no net Cl- flux and no voltage change. However, the opened Cl- channels dramatically increase the membrane conductance (reduce input resistance, Rm). According to Ohm's law, V = I × R: the same excitatory synaptic current (I) now produces a smaller voltage change (V) because R is reduced. The Cl- conductance provides a low-resistance 'shunt' pathway that diverts excitatory current, clamping the membrane near ECl and opposing depolarization. Shunting inhibition is particularly effective when the inhibitory synapse is located between the excitatory synapse and the axon hillock, creating an electrical 'roadblock.' This form of inhibition is especially important in cortical circuits where it provides divisive normalization of neural responses.",

(2) Normal mEPSC frequency: Spontaneous release rate is normal → number of functional release sites and spontaneous fusion machinery are intact. (3) Reduced evoked EPSC: Fewer vesicles released per action potential → reduced evoked release probability (Pr). (4) Unchanged PPR: PPR typically changes inversely with Pr. If the mutation reduces Pr at all synapses equally (e.g., by affecting Ca2+ channel distance from the release site at all active zones), the relative change in Pr between the first and second pulse remains the same, so PPR is preserved.

      "explanation": "Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine share a common mechanism: use-dependent (frequency-dependent) block of voltage-gated Na+ channels. These drugs bind preferentially to Na+ channels in the inactivated state (which accumulates during rapid firing) and slow recovery from inactivation. This means: (1) During normal, low-frequency neuronal activity: Most channels are in the resting state, drug binding is minimal, and neural function is largely preserved. (2) During high-frequency seizure activity: Channels rapidly cycle through open→inactivated states, accumulating drug binding. Progressive channel block reduces the ability to sustain rapid repetitive firing, dampening seizure propagation. This use-dependent selectivity provides an excellent therapeutic window — seizure activity is suppressed while normal brain function continues. Other AED mechanisms include: GABA enhancement (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, valproate), glutamate reduction (perampanel), Ca2+ channel block (ethosuximide for T-type), and SV2A binding (levetiracetam).",

Each ion's contribution is weighted by its membrane permeability (P). At rest, PK dominates, pulling Vm near EK, but the finite PNa and PCl push Vm slightly positive from EK. The GHK equation also explains why the resting potential changes when relative permeabilities change: during the action potential peak, PNa >> PK drives Vm toward ENa. Key assumptions: (1) constant electric field across the membrane, (2) independent ion movement, (3) steady-state conditions. The GHK equation does not account for active transport (pumps) or for voltage-gated channel dynamics.

Neurons cannot synthesize choline de novo — they depend on: (1) recycling of choline from AChE-mediated ACh hydrolysis in the synaptic cleft, taken up by the high-affinity choline transporter CHT1 (SLC5A7), a Na+-dependent transporter with Km ~1-5 uM for choline; (2) dietary choline from plasma.

At very negative potentials (-80 mV), the strong inward electrical field drives Mg2+ deep into the pore, causing nearly complete block — only a small inward current flows despite the large driving force. As the membrane depolarizes from -80 to -20 mV, the Mg2+ block is progressively relieved (Mg2+ is expelled from the pore), and the conductance INCREASES. In this range (-80 to -20 mV), the NMDA current becomes MORE inward with depolarization — the opposite of normal behavior (normally, depolarization reduces inward current by reducing driving force). This produces the region of 'negative slope conductance' (current increasing with depolarization). Above -20 mV, the Mg2+ block is essentially fully relieved, and the I-V relationship becomes approximately linear (current decreasing with depolarization as driving force diminishes), reversing near +10 mV.

      "explanation": "The relationship between extracellular Ca2+ concentration and neurotransmitter release follows a power-law relationship: Release ∝ [Ca2+]^n, where n is the Hill coefficient (cooperativity). From the data: at 2 mM Ca2+, EPSC = 10 nA; at 0.5 mM Ca2+, EPSC = 0.3 nA. If Release ∝ [Ca2+]^n, then 10/0.3 = (2/0.5)^n → 33 = 4^n → n = log(33)/log(4) = 1.52/0.60 = 2.5. However, this underestimates the true cooperativity because reducing extracellular Ca2+ also reduces single-channel Ca2+ current, not just channel open probability. Direct measurements of intracellular Ca2+ transients vs. release show a Hill coefficient of approximately 4-5. This reflects the binding of ~5 Ca2+ ions to synaptotagmin-1 (3 to C2A + 2 to C2B) cooperatively triggering the fusion reaction.

This is close to the typical neuronal resting potential of -70 mV. The calculation shows how the small Na+ permeability (PNa = 0.04 × PK) pulls the membrane potential positive from the K+ equilibrium potential (EK = 61.5 × log[5/140] = -89 mV) toward ENa. If PNa were zero, Vm would equal EK (-89 mV). The approximately -20 mV difference between EK and the resting Vm is due to the small but non-zero Na+ permeability, which provides a tonic depolarizing influence balanced by K+ efflux through leak channels.",

Fluorescent puncta represent presynaptic boutons containing dye-loaded vesicles. (3) Destaining: Stimulate again (without dye). Each vesicle fusion event releases a packet of FM dye into the bath. The rate of fluorescence loss at individual boutons reflects the rate of exocytosis and thus the release probability. High-Pr boutons destain rapidly; low-Pr boutons destain slowly.

Synaptic potentials generated at dendritic spines must propagate passively (as graded potentials, not action potentials) along the dendritic shaft to reach the soma and axon initial segment where integration occurs. The dendrite acts as a 'leaky cable': (1) The finite membrane resistance (Rm) allows current to leak out through ion channels along the way. (2) The finite axoplasmic resistance (Ri) impedes longitudinal current flow. (3) The membrane capacitance (Cm) filters the signal, reducing amplitude and broadening the time course. The length constant lambda = sqrt(Rm/Ri) determines the exponential decay: V(x) = V0 × exp(-x/lambda). With lambda typically 200-500 um for thin dendrites, a 400 um dendritic distance causes significant attenuation (to ~37% at one lambda, less at greater distances). Neurons partially compensate through: (1) dendritic Na+/Ca2+ spikes that boost distal signals, (2) Ih current that normalizes temporal filtering, and (3) higher synaptic conductance at distal synapses.",

S2 is TRUE: The K+ gradient, combined with the high resting K+ permeability through K2P and Kir leak channels, is the primary determinant of the resting membrane potential. The GHK equation shows Vm sits closest to EK because PK >> PNa at rest.

This enormous gradient is maintained by PMCA, NCX, SERCA, and mitochondrial uptake. Even modest Ca2+ channel opening produces significant relative Ca2+ increases. S4 is FALSE: A single action potential moves only about 1 picomole of Na+ per cm² of membrane, changing intracellular [Na+] by less than 0.001%. The Na+/K+ ATPase can easily restore this.

The RRP can be released by a brief train of action potentials or by hypertonic sucrose application (which triggers fusion independent of Ca2+). S2 is TRUE: The recycling pool (~10-20% of total) is replenished by endocytosis of fused vesicle membrane and supports transmission during moderate activity.

S2 is TRUE: GABA_B receptors (Gi/o-coupled) on excitatory (or inhibitory) presynaptic terminals reduce neurotransmitter release through two mechanisms: (1) Gbetagamma-mediated inhibition of P/Q-type and N-type Ca2+ channels, reducing Ca2+ influx; (2) Gbetagamma activation of GIRK channels (at the soma) and direct modulation of the release machinery.

This regenerative cycle is responsible for the explosive rising phase once threshold is reached, and is the basis of the all-or-none property. S2 is TRUE: Repolarization requires two concurrent events: (1) Na+ channels undergo fast inactivation (h-gate closure), terminating Na+ influx; (2) delayed rectifier K+ channels (Kv2, Kv3) open (slower kinetics than Na+ activation), driving K+ outward and repolarizing the membrane. S3 is FALSE: The Na+/K+ ATPase is NOT required for immediate recovery. Ion gradients barely change during a single AP (only ~1 picomole Na+/cm² crosses). The refractory period depends on Na+ channel recovery from inactivation and K+ channel deactivation, not on gradient restoration. The pump maintains gradients over the long term.

This contrasts with LTP induction, which requires brief, large Ca2+ transients from high-frequency stimulation. S2 is TRUE: Calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) has a higher affinity for Ca2+/calmodulin (Kd ~0.1 nM) than CaMKII (Kd ~10-50 nM). Therefore, modest Ca2+ elevations preferentially activate calcineurin, while large Ca2+ elevations additionally activate CaMKII. This Ca2+ amplitude-dependent selectivity determines the plasticity outcome. S3 is TRUE: Calcineurin dephosphorylates inhibitor-1, releasing PP1. PP1 dephosphorylates GluA1 at Ser845 (PKA site) and Ser831 (CaMKII site). Dephosphorylated AMPA receptors are internalized by clathrin-AP2-mediated endocytosis, reducing surface receptor number and weakening the synapse.

S2 is TRUE: Priming converts docked vesicles to a fusion-competent state.

A larger tau means the membrane charges more slowly but also holds charge longer (slower decay of voltage changes). Typical neuronal tau values range from 10-50 ms. S2 is TRUE: With a longer tau, EPSPs decay more slowly after synaptic current stops. This means that a second EPSP arriving before the first has fully decayed will summate with the residual depolarization, increasing the chance of reaching threshold. This is temporal summation. Neurons with longer tau (e.g., large cortical pyramidal neurons) show more temporal summation than neurons with short tau (e.g., fast-spiking interneurons). S3 is TRUE: Ohm's law applies: the voltage change produced by injecting current I equals V = I × Rin. Smaller neurons typically have higher Rin (fewer channels and less membrane), so they produce larger voltage changes for the same current. This is why small neurons are often more excitable.

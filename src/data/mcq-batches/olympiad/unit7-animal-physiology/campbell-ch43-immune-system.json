      "question": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system. TLR4 specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. What downstream signaling pathway does TLR4 activation trigger?",
      "options": [
        "TLR4 signals through MyD88 adaptor protein, activating NF-kB transcription factor, which translocates to the nucleus and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6",
        "TLR4 activates the JAK-STAT pathway, directly phosphorylating STAT3 to induce interferon production",
        "TLR4 directly activates caspase-1, triggering immediate apoptosis of the infected cell",
        "TLR4 signals through the Notch pathway, inducing differentiation of naive T cells into effector cells"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TLR4 is the primary receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. When LPS binds TLR4 (in complex with MD-2 and CD14), TLR4 dimerizes and recruits intracellular adaptor proteins, primarily MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88). MyD88 activates IRAK kinases (IL-1 receptor-associated kinases), which activate TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6). TRAF6 then activates the IKK complex (IkB kinase), which phosphorylates IkB, the inhibitor of NF-kB. Phosphorylated IkB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus. NF-kB is a master transcription factor that upregulates hundreds of pro-inflammatory genes including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. TLR4 also has a MyD88-independent pathway through TRIF adaptor, which leads to IRF3 activation and type I interferon production. Option A describes a different pathway. Option C confuses TLR signaling with inflammasome activation. Option D involves adaptive immunity signaling.",

      "question": "MHC class I molecules present endogenous (intracellular) peptide antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. What is the source of these peptides and how are they loaded onto MHC I?",
      "options": [
        "Extracellular proteins are endocytosed, digested in lysosomes, and loaded onto MHC I in endosomes",
        "MHC I molecules synthesize their own peptide antigens using ribosomal machinery within the ER",

        "Viral RNA is directly bound by MHC I without any processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway is critical for immune surveillance of intracellular infections and tumors. The process begins when intracellular proteins (including viral proteins, mutated self-proteins, and normal self-proteins for tolerance) are tagged with ubiquitin and degraded by the proteasome (specifically the immunoproteasome during infection, which has modified catalytic subunits induced by interferon-gamma). The resulting peptide fragments (typically 8-10 amino acids) are transported from the cytosol into the ER lumen by TAP (Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing), a heterodimeric ABC transporter composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. In the ER, peptides are loaded onto MHC I molecules (which consist of a polymorphic heavy chain and beta-2 microglobulin) with the help of a peptide-loading complex including tapasin, ERp57, and calreticulin. Only peptides that fit the binding groove and stabilize the MHC I-peptide complex are retained. The stable complex then transits through the Golgi to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells. Option A describes the MHC class II pathway. Options C and D describe non-existent mechanisms.",

      "question": "Clonal selection theory explains how the adaptive immune system generates specific responses. What happens when a naive B cell encounters its cognate antigen for the first time?",
      "options": [
        "The B cell transfers its antigen receptor gene to neighboring T cells, enabling them to directly recognize the pathogen",
        "The B cell is activated, proliferates to form a clone of identical cells, and differentiates into antibody-secreting plasma cells (initially producing IgM) and long-lived memory B cells",
        "The B cell undergoes apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity, and a new B cell with the same receptor is generated from stem cells",
        "The B cell immediately begins producing high-affinity IgG antibodies that neutralize the pathogen within minutes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Clonal selection, first proposed by Burnet in 1957, is the fundamental mechanism of adaptive immunity. Each naive B cell expresses a unique B cell receptor (BCR, membrane-bound immunoglobulin) generated through V(D)J recombination during B cell development in the bone marrow. When a naive B cell encounters an antigen that specifically binds its BCR (with help from T follicular helper cells for most antigens), it becomes activated. The activated B cell then undergoes rapid clonal expansion \u2014 dividing multiple times to generate a large clone of cells with identical antigen specificity. Some of these clonal daughters differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts and then plasma cells, which secrete large quantities of antibody (initially IgM, the first class produced). Other daughter cells enter germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (changing to IgG, IgA, or IgE), followed by affinity maturation through selection for higher-affinity variants. Some cells become long-lived memory B cells that persist for decades and can mount rapid secondary responses. Option A is wrong \u2014 initial response takes 5-7 days and produces IgM first. Option B describes negative selection. Option D fabricates a mechanism.",

      "question": "V(D)J recombination generates the enormous diversity of antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes. The RAG1/RAG2 recombinase complex mediates this process. Approximately how many different antibody specificities can be generated, and what are the main mechanisms contributing to this diversity?",
      "options": [
        "Approximately 10^4 specificities, generated by random point mutations in a single antibody gene",
        "Approximately 10^6 specificities, generated exclusively by somatic hypermutation in germinal centers",
        "Approximately 10^11 or more specificities, generated through combinatorial joining of V, D, and J gene segments, junctional diversity (P and N nucleotide addition), and combinatorial pairing of heavy and light chains",
        "Approximately 1,000 specificities, generated solely by having 1,000 different germline V gene segments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The adaptive immune system generates an extraordinary diversity of antigen receptors through multiple mechanisms acting at different stages. (1) Combinatorial diversity \u2014 the heavy chain locus has approximately 40 functional V segments, 25 D segments, and 6 J segments. Random joining gives 40 x 25 x 6 = 6,000 combinations for heavy chain alone. Light chain (kappa or lambda) adds another approximately 200 combinations. (2) Junctional diversity \u2014 during V(D)J recombination, the RAG complex creates imprecise joins. P nucleotides are added when hairpin intermediates are asymmetrically opened by Artemis nuclease. N nucleotides are added randomly by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme that adds nucleotides without a template. These junctional additions/deletions at the V-D, D-J, and V-J boundaries create enormous diversity at the CDR3 region (the most variable part of the antigen-binding site). (3) Combinatorial pairing of heavy and light chains multiplies diversity further. Together, these mechanisms generate a theoretical diversity exceeding 10^11 unique specificities from a genome with fewer than 400 gene segments. Somatic hypermutation (option D) occurs later, during the immune response, and further diversifies already-rearranged antibodies in germinal centers.",

      "question": "The complement system consists of over 30 plasma proteins that form a proteolytic cascade. The classical pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes. Which complement component forms the membrane attack complex (MAC), and what is its mechanism of action?",
      "options": [
        "C3b molecules aggregate on the pathogen surface, forming a physical barrier that blocks nutrient uptake",
        "C1q directly inserts into the bacterial membrane, creating pores",
        "C5b initiates MAC assembly by recruiting C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, which polymerize to form a transmembrane pore approximately 10 nm in diameter that disrupts osmotic balance, causing cell lysis",
        "C4b binds to bacterial flagella, immobilizing the pathogen and preventing tissue invasion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The membrane attack complex (MAC) is the terminal effector of the complement cascade. After complement activation (through classical, lectin, or alternative pathways) generates C5 convertase, C5 is cleaved into C5a (a potent anaphylatoxin and chemotactic factor) and C5b. C5b initiates MAC assembly on the target membrane through a sequential, non-enzymatic process: C5b binds C6, then C7, forming C5b67 which inserts into the lipid bilayer. C8 then binds and partially penetrates the membrane, creating a small pore. Finally, C9 molecules are recruited and polymerize (10-16 C9 molecules) to form the complete ring-shaped transmembrane channel (poly-C9), approximately 10 nm in inner diameter. This pore is large enough to allow free passage of water, ions, and small molecules, disrupting the osmotic barrier and causing influx of water and calcium ions. In nucleated cells, this can trigger apoptosis or activate repair mechanisms, while in bacteria and red blood cells, it causes direct osmotic lysis. Gram-negative bacteria are particularly susceptible because the MAC can breach their outer membrane, while gram-positive bacteria are relatively resistant due to their thick peptidoglycan layer. Option A describes opsonization. Option B misidentifies the pore-forming component. Option D fabricates a mechanism.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "CD4+ T helper cell differentiation is directed by the cytokine milieu present during T cell activation. For Th1 differentiation: IL-12 (produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to intracellular pathogens) and IFN-gamma (from NK cells early in infection) activate STAT4 and STAT1 respectively, which induce the master transcription factor T-bet. T-bet drives expression of IFN-gamma (the signature Th1 cytokine), creating a positive feedback loop, and suppresses Th2 development. Th1 cells activate macrophages and promote cytotoxic responses against intracellular pathogens. For Th2 differentiation: IL-4 (initial source debated \u2014 possibly basophils, NKT cells, or T cells themselves) activates STAT6, inducing the master transcription factor GATA-3. GATA-3 drives expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, promoting B cell class switching to IgE, eosinophil activation, and mucus production. Th2 responses target helminths and are responsible for allergic diseases. This Th1/Th2 paradigm has expanded to include Th17 (driven by IL-6 + TGF-beta, master TF ROR-gamma-t), Treg (TGF-beta alone, master TF Foxp3), and Tfh subsets. Option A reverses the cytokines.

      "options": [
        "Memory B cells have already undergone class switching and somatic hypermutation, producing higher-affinity IgG rapidly; memory T cells have lower activation thresholds and respond faster; both populations are present in greater numbers than naive precursors",
        "The innate immune system 'remembers' the pathogen through permanent changes in macrophage gene expression",
        "More antigen-presenting cells are available during secondary infection because they were not destroyed during the primary response",
        "The pathogen evolves to become weaker upon re-exposure, making it easier to clear"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The secondary (anamnestic) immune response differs from the primary response in four key ways, all attributable to immunological memory. (1) Speed \u2014 memory cells respond within 1-3 days versus 5-10 days for naive cells. Memory B cells have lower activation thresholds and can present antigen more efficiently because they express higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC II. Memory T cells are positioned at tissue sites (tissue-resident memory T cells) rather than confined to lymph nodes. (2) Magnitude \u2014 memory cell precursor frequency is 100-1000x higher than naive precursor frequency for a given antigen. Memory cells proliferate more vigorously upon restimulation. (3) Affinity \u2014 memory B cells have already undergone somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in germinal centers, so they produce higher-affinity antibodies immediately upon restimulation. (4) Antibody class \u2014 memory B cells have already undergone class switch recombination, so the secondary response is dominated by IgG (or IgA at mucosal sites) rather than IgM. Memory T cells have epigenetic modifications that allow faster expression of effector cytokines. Together, these quantitative and qualitative improvements make the secondary response dramatically more effective.",

      "options": [
        "AIRE promotes ectopic expression of tissue-specific antigens (such as insulin, thyroglobulin, and myelin proteins) in thymic medullary epithelial cells, allowing developing T cells to be tested against a comprehensive array of self-antigens",

        "AIRE is a kinase that phosphorylates self-reactive TCRs, marking them for degradation",
        "AIRE blocks the production of self-reactive antibodies by B cells in the bone marrow"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "AIRE (Autoimmune Regulator) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Its remarkable function is to drive 'promiscuous gene expression' \u2014 the ectopic transcription of thousands of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) that are normally expressed only in specific peripheral tissues. For example, mTECs expressing AIRE produce insulin (normally pancreas-specific), thyroglobulin (thyroid-specific), myelin basic protein (nervous system-specific), and hundreds of other tissue-specific proteins. These proteins are processed and presented on MHC molecules on the mTEC surface. Developing T cells that strongly recognize these self-peptide-MHC complexes are eliminated by apoptosis (negative selection), preventing them from escaping to the periphery and attacking self-tissues. AIRE mutations in humans cause APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy), a devastating autoimmune syndrome affecting multiple organs \u2014 demonstrating that without AIRE, self-reactive T cells escape thymic selection and attack the tissues whose antigens were not presented during development. AIRE achieves its transcriptional effects partly through interaction with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and DNA damage response machinery. Option A fabricates a mechanism. Option C confuses T and B cell tolerance. Option D oversimplifies Treg biology.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Type I hypersensitivity is a two-phase process. In the sensitization phase, initial allergen exposure drives Th2 responses and IgE class switching in B cells. Secreted IgE binds with extremely high affinity (Ka approximately 10^10 M^-1) to Fc-epsilon-RI receptors on mast cell and basophil surfaces, where it persists for weeks. In the effector phase (re-exposure), multivalent allergen crosslinks adjacent IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. This crosslinking aggregates Fc-epsilon-RI receptors, activating intracellular signaling cascades involving Lyn and Syk kinases, PLCgamma, and calcium mobilization. The result is rapid degranulation (within seconds to minutes), releasing preformed granule mediators: histamine (causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, itching), heparin (anticoagulant), tryptase and chymase (proteases), and TNF-alpha. The late phase (hours later) involves de novo synthesis of lipid mediators: prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4/D4/E4 (previously called slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis \u2014 1000x more potent bronchoconstrictors than histamine), and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) that recruit eosinophils and sustain inflammation.

        "NK cells use T cell receptors generated by V(D)J recombination to recognize specific viral antigens"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "NK cell target recognition is governed by the 'missing self' and 'induced self' hypotheses, mediated through a balance of activating and inhibitory receptor signals. Inhibitory receptors \u2014 including killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in humans and Ly49 receptors in mice \u2014 recognize MHC class I molecules on target cells. Since all healthy nucleated cells express MHC I, this generates a dominant inhibitory signal that prevents NK cell activation. Many viruses and tumors downregulate MHC I to evade CD8+ T cell recognition, but this removes the inhibitory signal from NK cells ('missing self'), tipping the balance toward activation. Simultaneously, activating receptors \u2014 including NKG2D, natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46), and DNAM-1 \u2014 recognize stress-induced ligands that are upregulated on infected, transformed, or stressed cells. NKG2D recognizes MICA, MICB, and ULBPs \u2014 molecules induced by DNA damage, viral infection, or cellular transformation ('induced self'). When activating signals exceed inhibitory signals, the NK cell degranulates, releasing perforin and granzymes. NK cells also mediate ADCC (option C) through the FcgammaRIII (CD16) receptor, but this is not their sole mechanism.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Class switch recombination (CSR) is an irreversible DNA recombination event that occurs in activated B cells, typically in germinal centers. The mechanism involves: (1) Cytokine signals from T helper cells determine which constant region gene segment will be targeted \u2014 IFN-gamma directs switching to IgG1/IgG3, IL-4 to IgG4/IgE, TGF-beta to IgA. These cytokines induce germline transcription through specific switch (S) regions, opening the chromatin. (2) Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme also responsible for somatic hypermutation, deaminates cytosine residues to uracil in the S regions of both the donor (Smu) and target constant region genes. (3) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) removes the uracils, creating abasic sites. Mismatch repair and base excision repair enzymes then convert these into single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks. (4) The region between the two S regions (including the intervening constant region genes) is looped out and deleted. (5) The break ends are joined by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), placing the rearranged VDJ segment upstream of the new constant region.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the immune system, uniquely positioned to connect innate detection of pathogens to adaptive immune activation. Their lifecycle involves two phases: (1) Immature DCs reside in peripheral tissues (skin Langerhans cells, mucosal DCs, interstitial DCs) where they are specialized for antigen capture through macropinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis (via C-type lectin receptors, scavenger receptors), and phagocytosis. They express high levels of pattern recognition receptors (TLRs, NOD-like receptors, RIG-I) but low levels of MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules. (2) Upon pathogen detection, DCs undergo maturation \u2014 a dramatic phenotypic transformation. They upregulate CCR7 (chemokine receptor for CCL19/CCL21), enabling migration to T cell zones of draining lymph nodes. During migration, they process captured antigens, upregulate MHC I and MHC II surface expression (10-100 fold increase), and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Mature DCs present antigen-MHC complexes to naive T cells that continuously recirculate through lymph nodes, providing the three signals required for T cell activation: Signal 1 (antigen-MHC/TCR), Signal 2 (co-stimulation), and Signal 3 (polarizing cytokines). No other cell type performs this sentinel-to-activator transition as efficiently.",

      "explanation": "CD8+ CTLs use two distinct but complementary killing mechanisms, both inducing apoptosis (not necrosis) in target cells \u2014 this is important because apoptosis is immunologically 'clean' and does not release inflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns. Pathway 1 \u2014 Perforin/Granzyme: Upon TCR recognition of peptide-MHC I on a target cell, the CTL polarizes its secretory machinery toward the immunological synapse. Lytic granules containing perforin and granzymes are released by directed exocytosis. Perforin (homologous to complement C9) polymerizes in the target cell membrane, forming pores approximately 16 nm in diameter. Granzymes (serine proteases, particularly granzyme B) enter through these pores and directly cleave and activate initiator caspase-8 and effector caspase-3, as well as the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, triggering the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Pathway 2 \u2014 Fas/FasL: CTLs express Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L) on their surface. Binding to Fas (CD95) on target cells triggers trimerization of Fas, recruitment of FADD adaptor protein and caspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which activates the caspase cascade. The perforin/granzyme pathway is the dominant mechanism for clearing viral infections and tumors, while the Fas/FasL pathway is important for immune regulation and lymphocyte homeostasis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "HIV entry is a multi-step process requiring sequential receptor interactions. First, the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds with high affinity to the CD4 molecule on the target cell surface. This binding induces a conformational change in gp120 that exposes the co-receptor binding site. gp120 then binds to a chemokine co-receptor \u2014 either CCR5 (used by macrophage-tropic strains, predominant in early infection) or CXCR4 (used by T cell-tropic strains, emerging in late disease). This second binding triggers a conformational change in gp41 (the transmembrane envelope protein), exposing its hydrophobic fusion peptide, which inserts into the host cell membrane. gp41 then folds into a hairpin structure, pulling the viral and cellular membranes together until they fuse, releasing the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. The CCR5-delta32 mutation (a 32-base-pair deletion rendering CCR5 non-functional) confers resistance to HIV infection \u2014 this was the basis for the 'Berlin patient' cure. CD4+ T cell depletion is catastrophic because these cells are the central coordinators of adaptive immunity: they provide help to B cells (class switching, germinal center reactions), to CD8+ T cells (initial priming and memory maintenance), and to macrophages (IFN-gamma activation). Without CD4 help, the entire adaptive immune system eventually collapses, leading to opportunistic infections and malignancies that define AIDS.",

Phase 2 (minutes) \u2014 Vascular changes: Histamine and prostaglandins cause arteriolar vasodilation (increased blood flow = redness and heat). TNF-alpha and histamine cause endothelial cell contraction in postcapillary venules, creating intercellular gaps that increase vascular permeability, allowing plasma proteins (complement, antibodies, clotting factors) and fluid to leak into tissues (edema = swelling). Phase 3 (minutes to hours) \u2014 Leukocyte recruitment: Activated endothelial cells upregulate adhesion molecules (selectins for rolling, ICAM-1/VCAM-1 for firm adhesion). Neutrophils roll on selectins, activate integrins, firmly adhere, and undergo transendothelial migration (diapedesis). They follow chemokine gradients (IL-8, C5a, fMLP) to the infection site.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) are the frontline antiviral cytokines. When a cell is infected by a virus, cytoplasmic sensors (RIG-I and MDA5 for RNA viruses, cGAS-STING for DNA viruses) detect viral nucleic acids and activate transcription factors IRF3/IRF7, which drive IFN-alpha/beta production. These interferons are secreted and bind to the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) on neighboring uninfected cells in a paracrine manner (and on the producing cell in an autocrine manner). IFNAR activation triggers the JAK-STAT signaling cascade: JAK1 and TYK2 kinases phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which form a heterodimer that combines with IRF9 to create the ISGF3 complex. ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and binds ISRE (interferon-stimulated response elements), inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Key ISG products include: PKR (protein kinase R) \u2014 phosphorylates eIF2-alpha, shutting down all protein synthesis; OAS (2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase) \u2014 activates RNase L, which degrades all RNA; Mx proteins \u2014 GTPases that block viral replication; ADAR \u2014 RNA editing enzyme; viperin \u2014 inhibits lipid raft formation needed for viral budding.

This pentameric structure provides 10 antigen-binding sites, giving IgM extraordinarily high avidity for multivalent antigens despite relatively low individual binding affinity. IgM is the most efficient immunoglobulin at activating complement (only one IgM pentamer is needed, versus two IgG molecules). Statement II is TRUE: IgA is the predominant antibody class at mucosal surfaces, constituting approximately 70% of total immunoglobulin production in the body. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is a dimer linked by a J chain with an additional secretory component (derived from the poly-Ig receptor during transcytosis across epithelial cells). sIgA provides 'immune exclusion' by binding pathogens and toxins at mucosal surfaces. Breast milk IgA is critical for neonatal mucosal immunity. Statement III is FALSE: IgE is present at the LOWEST serum concentration of all immunoglobulin classes (approximately 0.05 mg/dL versus approximately 1,200 mg/dL for IgG). IgE is involved in allergic responses and anti-helminth immunity, not opsonization. Statement IV is TRUE: IgG comprises approximately 75-80% of serum immunoglobulin.

Adenovirus E3-19K retains MHC I in the ER. HIV Nef protein downregulates MHC I from the cell surface. However, this creates vulnerability to NK cells (missing self recognition).

(2) Predominant isotype: The primary response is dominated by IgM (peaking at 100 units) with relatively little IgG (peaking at 30 units). The secondary response is overwhelmingly IgG (peaking at 800 units) because memory B cells have already undergone class switch recombination.

Group B (adult thymectomy) shows only mild initial immunosuppression because the peripheral T cell pool has already been established. Mature T cells in the periphery are remarkably long-lived \u2014 some memory T cells can persist for decades through homeostatic proliferation (driven by IL-7 and IL-15 and low-affinity interactions with self-peptide-MHC). However, without thymic output, the T cell repertoire gradually narrows as cells die and are not replaced, explaining the slow decline. Group C (adult thymectomy + irradiation) destroys both the thymus and existing peripheral T cells, recreating the Group A phenotype and proving that surviving peripheral T cells, not the thymus, were maintaining immunity in Group B.

      "explanation": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex that acts as an intracellular danger sensor. Activation is a two-step process: Signal 1 (priming) \u2014 NF-kB activation (e.g., by TLR signaling) upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1beta expression. Signal 2 (activation) \u2014 diverse danger-associated signals including extracellular ATP (binding P2X7 receptor), potassium efflux, lysosomal destabilization (from phagocytosed crystals like uric acid or silica), mitochondrial ROS, and others trigger NLRP3 oligomerization. The oligomerized NLRP3 recruits the ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD) adaptor, which forms large filamentous structures called ASC specks. ASC recruits pro-caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interactions, leading to proximity-induced auto-activation. Active caspase-1 performs two critical functions: (1) cleaves pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 into mature, bioactive cytokines that are secreted; (2) cleaves gasdermin D, releasing its N-terminal domain which oligomerizes in the plasma membrane to form large pores, causing a lytic form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Dysregulated NLRP3 activation contributes to gout, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and many other conditions.",

      "explanation": "Somatic hypermutation is a unique mutagenic process that specifically targets the variable region genes of immunoglobulins in activated B cells within germinal centers. The key enzyme is AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), the same enzyme responsible for class switch recombination. AID deaminates cytosine (C) to uracil (U) in single-stranded DNA exposed during transcription of the Ig V region genes. This C-to-U change is then processed through several mutagenic pathways: (1) Replication over the uracil introduces C-to-T transitions. (2) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) removes the uracil, creating an abasic site; replication over the abasic site introduces any nucleotide (transitions and transversions at C:G pairs). (3) Mismatch repair (MSH2/MSH6) is recruited to the U:G mismatch and introduces errors at neighboring A:T pairs through error-prone polymerase eta. The mutation rate is approximately 10^-3 per base pair per generation \u2014 approximately 10^6 times higher than the background somatic mutation rate. After SHM, B cells expressing higher-affinity BCRs compete for limiting antigen on follicular dendritic cells and T follicular helper cell help. Those with improved binding are positively selected (affinity maturation), while those with reduced binding die by apoptosis.",

      "explanation": "MHC polymorphism (over 25,000 alleles of HLA class I and II genes in the human population) is maintained by pathogen-driven balancing selection \u2014 one of the strongest examples of natural selection in the human genome. Each MHC allele has a unique peptide-binding groove that accommodates peptides with specific anchor residue motifs. Different alleles therefore present different subsets of pathogen-derived peptides. If MHC diversity were low (e.g., if all individuals had identical MHC), a pathogen that evolved to avoid presentation by that particular MHC would evade the entire population's T cell surveillance. With high MHC diversity, most pathogen peptides will be presented by at least some alleles in the population, ensuring population-level resistance. Evidence for pathogen-driven selection includes: (1) heterozygote advantage \u2014 MHC heterozygotes present a wider range of peptides and resist infections better (demonstrated for HIV and hepatitis); (2) frequency-dependent selection \u2014 rare MHC alleles confer advantage against pathogens adapted to common alleles; (3) MHC alleles show strong signatures of balancing selection at the molecular level (high dN/dS ratio in peptide-binding residues, trans-species polymorphisms). This is why MHC matching is critical for organ transplantation \u2014 the extreme polymorphism that benefits pathogen defense creates the organ rejection problem.",

They are defined by expression of CXCR5 (chemokine receptor for CXCL13, which guides them to B cell follicles), the transcription factor Bcl-6, and surface molecules PD-1 and ICOS. In germinal centers, Tfh cells perform several essential functions: (1) B cell selection \u2014 Tfh cells examine antigen presented on MHC II by germinal center B cells. B cells that have acquired mutations (through SHM) improving their ability to capture, process, and present antigen receive more Tfh help (positive selection). This is the basis of affinity maturation. (2) Survival signals \u2014 CD40L on Tfh cells engages CD40 on B cells, delivering critical anti-apoptotic signals. Without this interaction, germinal center B cells rapidly die by apoptosis.

      "explanation": "The PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) checkpoint pathway is a physiological mechanism for preventing excessive T cell activation and maintaining peripheral tolerance. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor upregulated on activated T cells. Its ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC), are expressed on antigen-presenting cells and many tissues. When PD-1 engages PD-L1/PD-L2, it recruits the phosphatase SHP-2, which dephosphorylates key signaling molecules downstream of the TCR and CD28, dampening T cell activation. Many tumors exploit this pathway by upregulating PD-L1 expression on their surface (often driven by IFN-gamma from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or by oncogenic signaling). This creates an immunosuppressive shield \u2014 T cells that recognize tumor antigens receive inhibitory signals through PD-1 upon encountering PD-L1 on the tumor, leading to T cell exhaustion (a state of progressive functional impairment characterized by reduced effector function, sustained inhibitory receptor expression, and altered transcriptional program driven by TOX). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab targeting PD-1; atezolizumab targeting PD-L1) block this interaction, reinvigorating exhausted T cells.

      "explanation": "Defensins are small (29-45 amino acids) cationic (positively charged) antimicrobial peptides that provide a rapid first-line defense against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. They are classified into alpha-defensins (found in neutrophil granules and Paneth cells of the small intestine), beta-defensins (produced by epithelial cells of skin, airways, and urogenital tract), and theta-defensins (cyclic, found in some primates). The antimicrobial mechanism exploits a fundamental difference between microbial and host membranes: microbial membranes are rich in negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, LPS) on their outer leaflet, while mammalian cell membranes have negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine) predominantly on the inner leaflet. The cationic defensins are electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged microbial surface. Upon reaching a threshold concentration, defensins insert into the lipid bilayer, oligomerize, and form transmembrane pores or channels. This disrupts membrane potential, causes leakage of cytoplasmic contents, and leads to cell death. Some defensins also have intracellular targets. The selectivity for microbial over host membranes provides a safety margin, though at very high concentrations, defensins can damage host cells. Some defensins also serve as chemokines, recruiting immune cells to infection sites.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Superantigens are among the most potent T cell activators known. Conventional antigens are processed into peptides (8-20 amino acids) and presented within the MHC peptide-binding groove, where they are recognized by specific TCRs \u2014 this activates only the tiny fraction (approximately 1 in 10^5 to 10^6) of T cells with matching specificity. Superantigens bypass this entire process: they bind intact (unprocessed) as whole proteins simultaneously to the lateral face of MHC class II molecules (outside the peptide-binding groove) and to the Vbeta domain of the TCR (outside the normal CDR3 antigen-recognition loops). Since superantigen binding depends only on the Vbeta gene segment used, and humans have approximately 50-60 Vbeta families (with specific superantigens binding to multiple families), each superantigen can activate 5-20% of all T cells \u2014 compared to 0.001-0.01% for a conventional antigen.

The system operates in three phases: (1) Adaptation (immunization) \u2014 When a bacterium survives phage infection, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins capture short fragments of phage DNA (protospacers, typically 20-50 bp) and integrate them as new spacer sequences into the CRISPR array, flanked by repeat sequences. This creates a genetic memory of past infections. (2) Expression (biogenesis) \u2014 The CRISPR array is transcribed into a long pre-crRNA, which is processed (by Cas6, RNase III, or tracrRNA-dependent mechanisms depending on the system type) into individual crRNAs, each containing one spacer sequence. (3) Interference (immunity) \u2014 crRNAs guide Cas effector proteins (e.g., Cas9 in Type II, Cas3 in Type I, Cas13 in Type VI) to complementary sequences in invading phage DNA. The Cas nuclease cleaves the foreign DNA, destroying it. A protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) ensures self-tolerance \u2014 the CRISPR array itself lacks PAM sequences, preventing self-cleavage.

      "explanation": "Active immunity results from stimulation of the individual's own immune system by antigen, either through natural infection or vaccination. The key feature is that the individual generates their own B and T cell responses, including memory cells that persist long-term (decades for some vaccines). There is a lag period of days to weeks before protective immunity develops. Examples include immunity after measles infection (lifelong) or MMR vaccination (>20 years). Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-formed immune effectors (usually antibodies) from an immune individual to a non-immune individual. Protection is immediate but temporary because the transferred antibodies have a limited half-life (IgG half-life approximately 21 days) and no memory cells are transferred. Examples include: maternal IgG crossing the placenta (protects neonates for approximately 6 months), maternal IgA in breast milk, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma therapy, and anti-venom/anti-toxin preparations.

Key adaptations include: (1) IgA dominance \u2014 The mucosal immune system preferentially induces class switching to IgA (via TGF-beta and APRIL/BAFF from epithelial cells). Secretory IgA provides non-inflammatory immune exclusion by binding pathogens and toxins at the mucosal surface without activating complement or inflammation. (2) Oral/mucosal tolerance \u2014 Specialized antigen-presenting cells in the gut (CD103+ dendritic cells) sample luminal antigens and, in the absence of danger signals, induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) producing TGF-beta and IL-10, generating active tolerance. Retinoic acid from gut DCs promotes gut-homing and Treg induction.

The membrane components (gp91phox/NOX2 and p22phox, forming cytochrome b558) and cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac GTPase) assemble at the phagosomal membrane. NOX2 catalyzes: NADPH + 2O2 -> NADP+ + 2O2- + H+, transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the membrane to reduce O2 to superoxide anion (O2-) within the phagosome. Superoxide is then converted through several pathways: Superoxide dismutase converts O2- to H2O2. Myeloperoxidase (MPO, which gives pus its green color) catalyzes H2O2 + Cl- -> HOCl (hypochlorous acid, essentially bleach), the most potent antimicrobial oxidant.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Allorecognition occurs through two distinct pathways. The direct pathway: Donor-derived APCs (dendritic cells, called passenger leukocytes) migrate from the graft to recipient lymph nodes. Recipient T cells recognize intact foreign MHC molecules on these donor APCs. Remarkably, 1-10% of all T cells cross-react with allogeneic MHC (compared to approximately 0.001% for a specific pathogen), explaining the vigorous rejection response. The indirect pathway: Donor MHC molecules shed from the graft are captured by recipient APCs, processed into peptides, and presented on recipient MHC molecules. This is identical to how foreign protein antigens are normally presented. The direct pathway dominates acute rejection (first weeks to months), while the indirect pathway becomes more important in chronic rejection. Acute cellular rejection involves CD8+ CTLs that directly kill graft cells expressing donor MHC I, and CD4+ T cells that activate macrophages (causing delayed-type hypersensitivity) and provide help for antibody production. Antibody-mediated rejection (involving anti-donor antibodies activating complement and causing endothelial injury) can cause hyperacute rejection (preformed antibodies), acute humoral rejection, or chronic antibody-mediated rejection.

      "explanation": "The cGAS-STING pathway is a major innate immune sensing pathway for cytoplasmic DNA detection. cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) is a nucleotidyltransferase enzyme that binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner. DNA in the cytoplasm is a danger signal \u2014 it can originate from DNA viruses (herpes, adenovirus), intracellular bacteria (Mycobacterium, Listeria), retroviruses (from reverse-transcribed DNA), or damaged mitochondria and nuclei (self-DNA). Upon binding dsDNA, cGAS undergoes conformational activation and catalyzes the synthesis of 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), a unique cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with mixed 2'-5' and 3'-5' phosphodiester linkages. 2'3'-cGAMP diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes), an ER-resident transmembrane adaptor protein. Activated STING traffics from the ER to the Golgi, where it recruits and activates TBK1 kinase. TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3, which dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and drives transcription of type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) and other antiviral genes. This pathway is critical for antiviral defense and also plays roles in autoimmunity (recognition of self-DNA), cancer immunosurveillance, and cellular senescence.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Helminth parasites are far too large for phagocytosis (adult worms can be meters long). Eosinophils have evolved a specialized extracellular killing mechanism. The process involves: (1) Helminth coating \u2014 Helminths are coated with IgE antibodies (produced in Th2-driven responses) and complement C3b. (2) Eosinophil recruitment \u2014 IL-5 (from Th2 cells) and eotaxin (CCL11) recruit and activate eosinophils, which express Fc receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRII/CD23 and FcepsilonRI) and complement receptors. (3) Degranulation \u2014 When eosinophils bind antibody-coated helminths through their Fc receptors, they undergo regulated degranulation, releasing their specific granule contents directly onto the parasite surface. Key granule proteins include: Major basic protein (MBP) \u2014 a highly cationic cytotoxin that disrupts lipid bilayers; Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) \u2014 a ribonuclease with membrane-damaging activity; Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) \u2014 generates reactive oxygen species (similar to neutrophil MPO); Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) \u2014 a ribonuclease toxic to neurons and parasites. (4) These proteins collectively damage the helminth tegument (surface covering), compromising its integrity. This ADCC-like mechanism is critical for anti-helminth defense.

They arrive as double-negative (DN, CD4-CD8-) thymocytes and progress through DN1-DN4 stages. During DN3, the TCR beta chain undergoes V(D)J recombination. A successfully rearranged beta chain pairs with a surrogate pre-T-alpha chain (beta-selection checkpoint). If successful, the cells proliferate and upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive (DP). The TCR alpha chain then rearranges.

DP thymocytes that can bind self-peptide-MHC with moderate affinity receive survival signals.

This generates robust humoral immunity (all antibody classes including IgA at mucosal sites), strong CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and durable immunological memory, often with a single dose. Limitations include risk in immunocompromised individuals and potential reversion to virulence. Statement II is TRUE: mRNA vaccines are a revolutionary platform. Synthetic mRNA (modified with pseudouridine for stability and reduced innate immune sensing) is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles for cellular uptake. Host ribosomes translate the mRNA into protein (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), which is then processed and presented on MHC I and II, generating both antibody and T cell responses. mRNA cannot integrate into the genome (it lacks reverse transcriptase and does not enter the nucleus), and it is degraded within days. Statement III is TRUE: Toxoid vaccines use chemically inactivated toxins (typically with formaldehyde). The immune response targets the toxin, not the bacterium \u2014 this provides anti-toxin immunity (neutralizing antibodies) but does not prevent colonization by the organism. Statement IV is TRUE: Polysaccharide antigens are T-independent \u2014 they activate B cells without T cell help, producing mainly IgM with no memory. Conjugating polysaccharides to protein carriers (e.g., tetanus toxoid, CRM197) enables CD4+ T cell help, promoting class switching to IgG, affinity maturation, and memory.

The classical pathway C3 convertase is C4b2a (formed after C1q binds antibody-antigen complexes, activating C1r and C1s, which cleave C4 and C2). The lectin pathway C3 convertase is also C4b2a (formed when mannose-binding lectin/MBL or ficolins bind mannose on pathogens, activating MASP-1/MASP-2). The alternative pathway C3 convertase is C3bBb (formed by spontaneous C3 hydrolysis and Factor B/Factor D amplification). All cleave C3 into C3a (anaphylatoxin) and C3b (opsonin). Statement II is TRUE: C3b contains a reactive thioester bond (between cysteine and glutamine in the thioester domain) that becomes exposed upon C3 cleavage. This thioester reacts with hydroxyl or amino groups on nearby surfaces, forming covalent ester or amide bonds. This ensures C3b deposits on the activating surface rather than diffusing away. Phagocytes bearing complement receptors (CR1/CD35 recognizes C3b; CR3/CD11b-CD18 recognizes iC3b) then efficiently phagocytose opsonized pathogens. Statement III is FALSE: The complement system is part of the INNATE immune system. The alternative and lectin pathways activate without antibodies. Only the classical pathway requires antibodies (IgM or IgG), linking it to adaptive immunity. Statement IV is TRUE: C3a and C5a are potent inflammatory mediators.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "These data illustrate the classic natural history of untreated HIV infection. The acute phase (weeks 0-8) shows massive viral replication: HIV infects activated CD4+ T cells (particularly in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, where 60% of all CD4+ T cells reside), causing a viremia spike reaching millions of copies/mL. This coincides with a dramatic drop in CD4+ count. The immune response then partially controls the virus: HIV-specific CD8+ CTLs emerge around week 3 and kill infected cells, while neutralizing antibodies appear later. By week 8-12, the immune response drives viral load down to a 'set point' \u2014 a quasi-steady state where viral production and immune-mediated clearance are balanced. The set point viral load (here approximately 50,000-100,000 copies/mL) is a powerful predictor of disease progression: patients with low set points (less than 10,000) progress slowly (greater than 10 years to AIDS), while those with high set points (greater than 100,000) progress rapidly (less than 5 years). The set point is determined by the quality of the CTL response (influenced by HLA type), viral fitness, and host genetic factors (e.g., CCR5 expression levels). During the chronic (clinical latency) phase, CD4+ counts slowly decline as the virus continuously replicates and immune activation causes immune exhaustion. When CD4 drops below 200/uL (year 8-10), AIDS develops.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cross-presentation violates the conventional rules of antigen presentation, which dictate that endogenous antigens are presented on MHC I (to CD8+ T cells) and exogenous antigens on MHC II (to CD4+ T cells). In cross-presentation, exogenous antigens taken up from the extracellular environment (through phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, or receptor-mediated endocytosis) are diverted into the MHC class I presentation pathway instead of, or in addition to, the MHC II pathway. Two mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the vacuolar pathway \u2014 antigens are processed by proteases in endosomes/phagosomes and loaded onto MHC I molecules recycling through the endosomal compartment; (2) the cytosolic pathway \u2014 antigens escape from endosomes into the cytosol, are processed by the proteasome, transported by TAP into the ER, and loaded onto MHC I in the conventional manner. Cross-presentation is critically important because many pathogens (especially non-cytopathic viruses and tumors) do not infect dendritic cells. Without cross-presentation, these pathogens could not be presented on MHC I to activate CD8+ CTL responses. Only certain dendritic cell subsets efficiently cross-present: CD8alpha+ DCs in mice and CD141+ (BDCA-3+) DCs in humans, which express specialized machinery including the DNGR-1 receptor.",

      "explanation": "Germ-free mice are a powerful tool for understanding microbiome-immune interactions.

(2) IgA deficiency \u2014 Dramatically reduced secretory IgA production, which normally shapes and is shaped by the microbiota (IgA-bacteria co-evolution). (3) T cell deficits \u2014 Reduced Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (normally induced by segmented filamentous bacteria/SFB) and reduced regulatory T cell populations (normally induced by Clostridia and Bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide A). (4) Systemic effects \u2014 Impaired splenic architecture, reduced circulating IgG levels, and impaired ability to clear systemic infections. These deficits demonstrate that the immune system requires microbial input for proper development and calibration.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Opsonization (from the Greek 'opsonin,' meaning to prepare food for eating) is the process by which molecules coat a pathogen surface to enhance its phagocytosis. IgG antibodies are the primary opsonins (particularly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses in humans). The mechanism involves: (1) Antibody binding \u2014 IgG antibodies bind to surface antigens on the pathogen through their Fab regions, with the Fc portions pointing outward. (2) Fc receptor engagement \u2014 Phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes) express Fc-gamma receptors (FcgammaRI/CD64, FcgammaRIIA/CD32, FcgammaRIII/CD16) that bind the Fc portion of IgG. FcgammaRI has the highest affinity and can bind monomeric IgG, while others require immune complexes. (3) Enhanced phagocytosis \u2014 Fc receptor engagement triggers signaling cascades (ITAM phosphorylation) that initiate actin polymerization, membrane extension, and engulfment. Opsonized particles are phagocytosed 10-100 times more efficiently than unopsonized ones. (4) Activation \u2014 Fc receptor signaling also activates antimicrobial mechanisms (respiratory burst, granule fusion) within the phagolysosome. Complement C3b also functions as an opsonin through complement receptor CR1. IgG and C3b together create synergistic opsonization, maximizing phagocytic efficiency.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Type III hypersensitivity involves the formation of immune complexes (antigen-antibody aggregates) that deposit in tissues, particularly in blood vessel walls, kidney glomeruli, joint synovium, and skin. The deposited complexes activate the classical complement pathway, generating anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) that recruit neutrophils. Neutrophils attempt to phagocytose the immune complexes but, being unable to internalize them from the tissue substrate, undergo frustrated phagocytosis \u2014 releasing their toxic granule contents (proteases, reactive oxygen species) onto the tissue surface, causing local damage. SLE is the prototypical Type III disease: patients produce antibodies against self-nuclear antigens (dsDNA, histones, ribonuclear proteins). These form immune complexes that circulate and deposit in multiple organs. In the kidney (lupus nephritis), immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane activates complement and recruits inflammatory cells, potentially causing renal failure. Similar deposition causes vasculitis, arthritis, and skin rashes. Other Type III diseases include serum sickness, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and Arthus reaction.

(2) Genetic engineering \u2014 T cells are transduced with a viral vector (usually lentivirus or retrovirus) encoding a chimeric antigen receptor. The CAR structure consists of: an extracellular domain \u2014 typically a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a tumor-associated antigen (e.g., CD19 on B cell malignancies); a hinge/spacer region; a transmembrane domain; and intracellular signaling domains \u2014 the CD3-zeta chain (providing TCR-like signal 1) plus co-stimulatory domains (CD28, 4-1BB/CD137, or both, providing signal 2). Second-generation CARs include one co-stimulatory domain; third-generation include two. (3) Expansion \u2014 CAR-T cells are expanded in vitro to billions of cells. (4) Infusion \u2014 After lymphodepleting chemotherapy, CAR-T cells are infused into the patient. The key advantage is MHC independence \u2014 CARs recognize surface antigens directly (like antibodies), bypassing the need for MHC presentation that tumors often downregulate.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) were discovered in 2004 and represent a novel form of cell death called NETosis. The process involves: (1) Activation \u2014 Neutrophils are stimulated by pathogens, PMA, LPS, IL-8, or immune complexes. (2) Chromatin decondensation \u2014 NADPH oxidase generates ROS, which activate peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). PAD4 citrullinates histones, weakening histone-DNA electrostatic interactions and causing massive chromatin decondensation. Simultaneously, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase translocate from granules to the nucleus, further disrupting chromatin structure. (3) NET release \u2014 The nuclear membrane dissolves, and the decondensed chromatin mixes with cytoplasmic and granule components. The plasma membrane ruptures, expelling the chromatin-antimicrobial protein complex into the extracellular space. (4) Pathogen trapping and killing \u2014 The expelled DNA forms a web-like meshwork that physically traps bacteria, fungi, and even parasites. The embedded antimicrobial proteins (elastase, cathepsin G, myeloperoxidase, defensins, lactoferrin, calprotectin) kill trapped pathogens. Histones themselves are antimicrobial due to their positive charge disrupting bacterial membranes.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Th17 differentiation is driven by a unique cytokine combination. TGF-beta alone would drive Foxp3 expression and regulatory T cell (Treg) development. However, when TGF-beta is combined with IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to infection), the signaling pathway is diverted. IL-6 activates STAT3, which induces the master transcription factor ROR-gamma-t (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma-t). ROR-gamma-t drives the expression of Th17 signature genes including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and CCR6. TGF-beta is needed to suppress alternative differentiation programs (inhibiting T-bet for Th1 and GATA-3 for Th2). IL-21 can substitute for IL-6 in an autocrine amplification loop (Th17 cells produce IL-21, which promotes further Th17 differentiation). IL-23 is critical for the maintenance, expansion, and pathogenic function of Th17 cells (but not for initial differentiation). This Th17 pathway defends against extracellular bacteria (Staphylococcus, Klebsiella) and fungi (Candida) by inducing neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells. Patients with defects in IL-17 signaling develop chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.

The formula: Herd immunity threshold = 1 - 1/R0. This represents the minimum proportion of the population that must be immune to drive the effective reproduction number (Re) below 1, causing the epidemic to decline. For highly transmissible diseases: Measles (R0 approximately 12-18): threshold = 1 - 1/15 = 93.3%. This explains why measles outbreaks occur when vaccination rates drop even slightly below 95%. Pertussis (R0 approximately 12-17): threshold = approximately 92-94%. For less transmissible diseases: Influenza (R0 approximately 2-3): threshold = approximately 50-67%. COVID-19 (original strain R0 approximately 2.5-3): threshold approximately 60-67%. Polio (R0 approximately 5-7): threshold approximately 80-86%.

Patient E (OD = 1.5): Clearly positive \u2014 OD is 10 times the cutoff. Patient C (OD = 0.18): Borderline positive \u2014 OD is just above the cutoff. This could represent: early seroconversion (patient recently infected, antibody levels still rising), low-level persistent antibodies from a past infection, cross-reactive antibodies from a related pathogen, or non-specific binding. Protocol requires retesting in duplicate, and if still borderline, a follow-up sample 2-4 weeks later to look for rising titers. Patient B (OD = 0.12): Negative \u2014 below cutoff. Patient D (OD = 0.03): Clearly negative \u2014 minimal background. Important considerations: sensitivity (ability to detect true positives) and specificity (ability to exclude true negatives) of any assay depend on where the cutoff is set.

Phase 1 \u2014 Neutrophil dominance (0-48 hours): Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited, increasing 300-fold by 24 hours. They are recruited by chemokines (IL-8/CXCL8, C5a, LTB4) released by tissue-resident sentinels (macrophages, mast cells). Neutrophils are short-lived (6-12 hour tissue lifespan) and are rapidly replaced \u2014 explaining the peak at 24h and subsequent decline. They provide critical early pathogen killing through phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETs. Phase 2 \u2014 Monocyte/macrophage transition (24h-5 days): Monocytes are recruited by CCL2/MCP-1 and differentiate into macrophages in the tissue. Their numbers rise more slowly but persist longer. Macrophages serve dual roles: continuing pathogen clearance (phagocytosis of pathogens and dead neutrophils \u2014 efferocytosis) and bridging to adaptive immunity through antigen presentation and cytokine production. Phase 3 \u2014 T cell dominance (5-10 days): T cells arrive last because adaptive immunity requires antigen processing, T cell priming in lymph nodes (1-3 days), clonal expansion (2-4 days), and migration to infected tissue. By day 10, T cells dominate, providing antigen-specific killing (CD8+ CTLs) and macrophage activation (CD4+ Th1 IFN-gamma).

The mu heavy chain (IgM) is the ideal target because: (1) B cell development requires expression of a functional pre-BCR (surrogate light chain + mu heavy chain) at the pre-B cell stage for survival and proliferation signals. Without mu heavy chain, B cell development arrests at the pro-B to pre-B transition, and essentially no mature B cells develop. (2) The muMT knockout mouse (deletion of the transmembrane exons of the mu gene) is the classic model \u2014 these mice lack surface IgM, preventing BCR signaling, and have virtually no B cells or antibodies. However, secreted IgM from the existing mu gene is also absent. (3) This approach does not affect T cell development (which occurs in the thymus and uses TCR, not BCR), NK cells, macrophages, or other immune components. The experiment would then compare pathogen challenge in wild-type versus muMT mice: if B cell-deficient mice have impaired pathogen clearance, antibodies are important. Additional controls: adoptive transfer of purified antibodies into muMT mice to test if antibodies alone can restore protection (reconstitution experiment).

      "explanation": "The invariant chain (Ii) is essential for MHC class II antigen presentation, serving three critical functions: (1) Peptide-binding groove blockade \u2014 Ii associates with newly synthesized MHC II alpha-beta dimers in the ER. A segment of Ii called CLIP (Class II-associated Invariant chain Peptide) occupies the peptide-binding groove, preventing endogenous ER peptides (which should be loaded on MHC I) from binding MHC II. This ensures MHC II presents exogenous, not endogenous, antigens. (2) ER retention and targeting \u2014 Ii contains sorting signals that direct MHC II-Ii complexes from the ER through the Golgi to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (MIIC \u2014 MHC II compartment), bypassing the cell surface. (3) Folding assistance \u2014 Ii promotes proper folding and assembly of MHC II dimers. In the acidic MIIC compartment, proteases (cathepsin S and L) progressively degrade Ii, leaving only the CLIP fragment in the groove. HLA-DM, a non-classical MHC II molecule, then catalyzes exchange of CLIP for high-affinity antigenic peptides (12-25 amino acids) generated by endosomal/lysosomal protease digestion of internalized antigens.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Trained immunity challenges the traditional view that innate immune cells cannot develop memory. Discovered by Mihai Netea and colleagues, trained immunity occurs when monocytes/macrophages exposed to certain stimuli (beta-glucan from Candida, BCG vaccine, oxidized LDL) develop enhanced capacity to respond to subsequent, potentially different, stimuli. The mechanism is epigenetic: (1) Histone modifications \u2014 Exposure to training stimuli induces activating histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3 at promoters; H3K27ac at enhancers) and removes repressive marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) at pro-inflammatory gene loci (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta). These marks persist for weeks to months, keeping these genes in a transcription-ready state. (2) Metabolic rewiring \u2014 Training induces a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg-like metabolism), with increased mTOR/HIF-1alpha signaling, cholesterol synthesis pathway activation, and enhanced pentose phosphate pathway. These metabolic changes provide biosynthetic precursors for cytokine production and directly influence epigenetic enzyme activity (acetyl-CoA for acetylation, alpha-ketoglutarate for demethylation). (3) These changes also occur at the level of bone marrow progenitors, generating 'trained' monocytes systemically. Trained immunity explains why BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against unrelated infections and reduces all-cause mortality in children beyond its specific anti-tuberculosis effect.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Antigenic drift and shift represent fundamentally different evolutionary strategies. Antigenic drift: The influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks proofreading activity, introducing approximately 1 mutation per genome per replication cycle. Mutations that alter the antigenic sites on HA and NA (particularly the five major antigenic sites on HA: Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, Cb) while maintaining protein function are positively selected by immune pressure. These accumulated point mutations gradually change the antigenic profile, allowing the virus to partially evade pre-existing antibodies. Drift causes seasonal epidemics and necessitates annual vaccine reformulation. Antigenic shift: Influenza A has a segmented genome (8 segments) that can undergo reassortment when two different influenza subtypes co-infect the same cell (often in pigs, which are susceptible to both avian and human strains). Reassortment can produce a virus with a completely new HA and/or NA subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity. This can trigger pandemics: 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1), 1957 Asian flu (H2N2), 1968 Hong Kong flu (H3N2), 2009 swine flu (H1N1pdm09). Shift only affects influenza A because only type A infects multiple species and has sufficient subtype diversity. Influenza B undergoes drift but not shift (it infects only humans, with no animal reservoir for reassortment).",

(3) Fusion \u2014 Splenocytes are mixed with myeloma cells (immortal antibody-producing tumor cells that have been selected for loss of HGPRT enzyme and inability to secrete their own antibodies). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or electrofusion induces cell membrane fusion, creating hybrid cells. (4) HAT selection \u2014 The cell mixture is cultured in HAT medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine). Aminopterin blocks the de novo nucleotide synthesis pathway. Unfused myeloma cells die because they lack HGPRT for the salvage pathway. Unfused B cells die naturally after a few days. Only hybridomas survive \u2014 they have HGPRT from the B cell (allowing salvage pathway use) and immortality from the myeloma cell.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "GVHD represents a reversal of the normal transplant rejection paradigm. In conventional graft rejection, the recipient's immune system recognizes and destroys donor tissue. In GVHD, the direction is reversed: immunocompetent donor T cells in the transplanted bone marrow (or stem cell graft) recognize recipient tissues as foreign and mount an immune attack against the host. Three conditions are required for GVHD (Billingham criteria, 1966): (1) The graft must contain immunocompetent cells (mature T cells). (2) The recipient must be immunocompromised (unable to reject the donor cells). (3) There must be MHC disparity between donor and recipient. The primary target organs are: skin (maculopapular rash progressing to erythroderma and bullous disease), liver (bile duct destruction causing jaundice), and gastrointestinal tract (epithelial cell apoptosis causing diarrhea and mucosal damage). These organs are targeted because they are rich in antigen-presenting cells and are sites of contact with the external environment. Acute GVHD (within 100 days) is mediated primarily by donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Chronic GVHD (after 100 days) resembles autoimmune disease with fibrosis and scleroderma-like features.

      "explanation": "Fever is a coordinated host defense mechanism.

(2) These cells produce endogenous pyrogens \u2014 primarily IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-alpha. (3) Endogenous pyrogens reach the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT), a circumventricular organ near the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus that lacks a blood-brain barrier. (4) Pyrogens induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in brain endothelial cells and perivascular cells, increasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. (5) PGE2 binds EP3 receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the preoptic area, raising the thermoregulatory set point.

These MHC II molecules have peptide-binding grooves that preferentially accommodate negatively charged residues at specific positions. (2) Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) modification \u2014 Gluten (particularly gliadin from wheat) is resistant to full digestion by gastric and pancreatic proteases, generating large immunogenic peptides. Tissue transglutaminase (the autoantigen in celiac disease) deamidates specific glutamine residues to glutamic acid, introducing negative charges that dramatically increase binding affinity for HLA-DQ2/DQ8.

The paracortex (deep cortex, T cell zone) contains T cells and interdigitating dendritic cells. T cells are attracted by CCL19 and CCL21, produced by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and high endothelial venules (HEVs), binding CCR7 on naive T cells and mature DCs. This co-localization of T cells and antigen-presenting DCs in the paracortex maximizes the probability that the rare T cell with matching specificity will encounter its cognate antigen. The medulla contains medullary cords (plasma cells, macrophages) and medullary sinuses (lymph filtration). The T-B border zone is where activated T cells and B cells interact \u2014 activated B cells upregulate CCR7 to migrate toward the T cell zone, while activated T cells upregulate CXCR5 to migrate toward the follicle, meeting at the border.",

When PPD (purified protein derivative) is injected intradermally: (1) 0-4 hours \u2014 Local dendritic cells and macrophages take up, process, and present PPD peptides on MHC II. (2) 4-12 hours \u2014 Circulating memory Th1 cells recognize PPD-MHC II and are activated, producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.

Activated macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, recruiting more monocytes and T cells. (4) 24-72 hours \u2014 Continued recruitment and activation creates a visible indurated area (firm, raised, measurable) at the injection site, composed of activated macrophages and T cells.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Phagocytosis is a highly regulated, receptor-mediated process. Recognition: Multiple receptor families detect different signals on pathogens. Fc receptors (FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIIA, FcgammaRIII) bind IgG-opsonized particles. Complement receptors (CR1/CD35, CR3/CD11b-CD18) bind C3b and iC3b-opsonized particles. Pattern recognition receptors directly recognize PAMPs: mannose receptor (CD206) binds terminal mannose on microbial glycoproteins; Dectin-1 recognizes beta-glucan in fungal cell walls; scavenger receptors (SR-A, MARCO) bind polyanionic ligands on bacteria. Engulfment: Receptor engagement triggers actin polymerization via Rho family GTPases (Rac, Cdc42), extending pseudopods that surround the particle and form a phagosome. FcR-mediated phagocytosis involves 'zippering' (tight membrane apposition), while CR3-mediated phagocytosis involves 'sinking' (particle descends into the cell). Killing: The phagosome matures through sequential fusion with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes, forming the phagolysosome. Killing mechanisms include: acidification (pH 4.5 by V-ATPase), NADPH oxidase (superoxide, H2O2, HOCl via myeloperoxidase), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NO and peroxynitrite), defensins and lysozyme, and hydrolytic enzymes (cathepsins, elastase).

It is structurally homologous to CD28 and binds the same B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86), but with 20-100 fold higher affinity. CTLA-4 functions as a negative regulator through multiple mechanisms: (1) Competitive inhibition \u2014 CTLA-4's higher affinity for B7 outcompetes CD28, preventing co-stimulatory signaling. (2) Trans-endocytosis \u2014 CTLA-4 physically removes B7 molecules from the APC surface through a process of capturing and internalizing B7, reducing co-stimulation availability for other T cells. (3) Cell-intrinsic inhibitory signaling \u2014 CTLA-4 recruits phosphatases (SHP-2, PP2A) that dephosphorylate TCR signaling molecules. (4) Treg-mediated suppression \u2014 CTLA-4 is constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells and is critical for their suppressive function. CTLA-4 primarily operates during T cell priming in lymph nodes (early in the response). The importance of CTLA-4 as a brake on immunity is demonstrated by CTLA-4 knockout mice, which develop fatal lymphoproliferative autoimmunity within 3-4 weeks. Blocking CTLA-4 with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) unleashes T cell responses against tumors \u2014 James Allison received the 2018 Nobel Prize for this discovery.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "X-linked SCID (SCID-X1) accounts for approximately 40-50% of all SCID cases and is caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene encoding the common gamma chain (gamma-c or CD132). The gamma-c chain is a crucial shared signaling component of receptors for six cytokines: IL-2 (T cell proliferation), IL-4 (B cell class switching, Th2 differentiation), IL-7 (T and B cell development \u2014 the most critical), IL-9 (mast cell growth), IL-15 (NK cell development and memory T cell homeostasis), and IL-21 (B cell differentiation, Tfh function). Loss of IL-7 signaling is the primary cause of T cell deficiency \u2014 IL-7 is essential for thymocyte survival and proliferation during T cell development, and IL-7R signaling drives V(D)J recombination of TCR genes through upregulation of RAG expression. Loss of IL-15 signaling prevents NK cell development. B cells may develop in normal numbers but are functionally impaired due to lack of T cell help (no IL-4 or IL-21 signaling for class switching and differentiation). Without treatment, SCID is fatal within the first year of life due to overwhelming infections. Treatment options include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy \u2014 X-linked SCID was the first disease successfully treated with gene therapy. Other SCID causes include ADA deficiency, RAG1/2 mutations, and JAK3 mutations.",

All jawed vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) possess MHC, immunoglobulins, TCRs, and RAG-mediated rearrangement. Invertebrates lack these components and rely on innate immunity (pattern recognition, phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides, complement-like systems).

Instead of immunoglobulins and TCRs, they use VLRs (Variable Lymphocyte Receptors) based on leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules.

      "explanation": "T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction that develops during chronic antigen stimulation, first characterized in chronic LCMV infection in mice and subsequently in human chronic viral infections (HIV, HCV, HBV) and cancer. Exhausted T cells are defined by: (1) Sustained high expression of multiple inhibitory receptors \u2014 PD-1 alone is insufficient as a marker since activated effector T cells also transiently express PD-1; the co-expression of PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, CD160, and 2B4 in various combinations defines the exhausted phenotype. (2) A hierarchical loss of effector functions: IL-2 production and proliferative capacity are lost first, followed by TNF-alpha production and then IFN-gamma production and cytolytic function (degranulation). Severely exhausted T cells may lose all functions and undergo deletion. (3) Distinct epigenetic programming \u2014 exhausted T cells have a unique chromatin landscape (driven by TOX transcription factor) that distinguishes them from effector and memory T cells. (4) Altered metabolism \u2014 decreased mitochondrial fitness with impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy) can partially reinvigorate exhausted T cells, which is the basis for cancer immunotherapy, though the epigenetic imprinting of exhaustion limits full functional recovery.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The three complement activation pathways differ in their initiation but converge at C3 convertase formation. The CLASSICAL pathway: C1q (part of the C1 complex with C1r and C1s) binds to the Fc regions of IgM (one molecule sufficient due to pentameric structure) or IgG (requires at least two molecules in close proximity) that are bound to antigen. This activates C1r/C1s serine proteases, which cleave C4 and C2 to form the classical C3 convertase (C4b2a). The LECTIN pathway: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins recognize pathogen-associated carbohydrate patterns (mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine in specific spatial arrangements). MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1 and MASP-2) cleave C4 and C2, forming the same C3 convertase (C4b2a). The ALTERNATIVE pathway: Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 in plasma (C3 tick-over, forming C3(H2O)) allows factor B binding and factor D cleavage, generating a fluid-phase C3 convertase (C3(H2O)Bb). On host cells, complement regulatory proteins (DAF/CD55, MCP/CD46, factor H) rapidly inactivate deposited C3b. Pathogen surfaces lacking these regulators allow C3b amplification, forming the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) stabilized by properdin. All three pathways can generate C5 convertase and MAC.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: IL-12 is the master cytokine driving Th1 polarization. Produced primarily by activated dendritic cells and macrophages (especially in response to intracellular pathogens), IL-12 signals through the IL-12R (IL-12Rbeta1/IL-12Rbeta2) and activates JAK2/TYK2, leading to STAT4 phosphorylation. STAT4 directly induces T-bet (TBX21), the master transcription factor for Th1 cells, which promotes IFN-gamma production and further stabilizes the Th1 program in a positive feedback loop. Statement II is TRUE: IL-4 signals through IL-4Ralpha/gammac receptor, activating JAK1/JAK3 and STAT6. Phosphorylated STAT6 induces GATA-3, the master Th2 transcription factor, which promotes IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production. IL-4 also directly acts on B cells to promote class switch recombination to IgE (and IgG4 in humans) by inducing germline transcription of the Cepsilon locus, making AID-mediated recombination to IgE possible. Statement III is TRUE: This represents one of the most important paradigms in T helper differentiation \u2014 the context-dependent role of TGF-beta. TGF-beta alone (with TCR signaling and IL-2) induces Foxp3 expression and generates induced regulatory T cells (iTregs). However, in the presence of inflammatory IL-6 (which activates STAT3), TGF-beta instead promotes RORgammat induction and Th17 differentiation, with STAT3 cooperating with RORgammat to drive IL-17 production. This molecular switch between tolerance (Treg) and inflammation (Th17) is critical for mucosal immunity. Statement IV is FALSE: While Tregs are important IL-10 producers, IL-10 is also produced by many other cell types including Th2 cells (IL-10 was originally called 'cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor'), Tr1 regulatory cells, regulatory B cells (Bregs), macrophages, dendritic cells, and even some Th1 cells (as a negative feedback mechanism). Furthermore, IL-10 plays important roles in B cell biology: it promotes B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation into plasma cells, and contributes to IgA class switching.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: SLE is a prototypic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens, particularly double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), histones, and ribonucleoproteins (Smith antigen, Ro/La). Anti-dsDNA antibodies (IgG) form immune complexes with circulating DNA/nucleosomes released from apoptotic cells (due to defective clearance). These immune complexes deposit in glomerular basement membrane (causing lupus nephritis \u2014 the most serious complication), synovial membranes (arthritis), and blood vessel walls (vasculitis). The deposited complexes activate complement via the classical pathway and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, causing tissue damage through type III hypersensitivity. Statement II is TRUE: Rheumatic fever following group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is a classic example of molecular mimicry. The streptococcal M protein shares structural homology with cardiac myosin, laminin, and other cardiac proteins. Antibodies generated against M protein cross-react with cardiac tissue, while T cells recognizing streptococcal peptides cross-react with heart valve tissue. This leads to pancarditis (inflammation of all three layers of the heart), with chronic valve damage (particularly mitral and aortic valves) from repeated episodes. Statement III is TRUE: MS is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease targeting CNS myelin. CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells reactive to myelin antigens (MBP, proteolipid protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) cross the blood-brain barrier during inflammation, recruit macrophages and activate resident microglia, causing demyelination. CD8+ T cells also contribute to axonal damage. The relapsing-remitting pattern reflects waves of inflammation followed by partial remyelination. Statement IV is FALSE: Type 1 diabetes involves autoimmune destruction of pancreatic BETA cells (not alpha cells). CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are indeed key effectors, targeting beta cell autoantigens (insulin, GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8). CD4+ T cells, autoantibodies, and inflammatory cytokines also contribute.

PRIMARY RESPONSE (Days 0-28): IgM appears first (peaks Day 14 at 1:256) because naive B cells initially express IgM/IgD \u2014 IgM is secreted first before class switching occurs. IgG appears later and rises more slowly, peaking around Day 21 (1:512) as B cells undergo class switch recombination in germinal centers. Both decline as the acute response contracts through apoptosis of most effector cells, but memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells persist. SECONDARY RESPONSE (Days 60-81): Several key differences are evident: (1) SPEED \u2014 IgG rises rapidly, reaching 1:2048 by Day 67 (just 7 days), compared to only 1:8 at Day 7 of the primary response. This reflects the higher frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells (~100-1000x more than naive precursors) and their lower activation threshold. (2) MAGNITUDE \u2014 Peak IgG reaches 1:16384, approximately 32-fold higher than the primary peak (1:512). This results from the expanded memory B cell pool undergoing rapid clonal expansion. (3) ISOTYPE \u2014 IgG dominates massively over IgM in the secondary response. Memory B cells have already undergone class switching and are poised to produce IgG (or IgA/IgE depending on the memory pool). The modest IgM response likely reflects activation of some remaining naive B cells. (4) AFFINITY \u2014 Although not shown in titer data, the IgG produced in the secondary response has significantly higher average affinity due to selection of high-affinity B cell clones during germinal center reactions in the primary response, and additional rounds of affinity maturation during the recall response.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "These data illustrate multiple interconnected principles of cancer immunology and immunotherapy biomarkers. TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN (TMB): Patient A has very high TMB (450 mut/Mb), typical of melanoma (UV-induced mutagenesis). More mutations generate more neoantigens \u2014 novel peptides derived from mutated proteins that can be presented on MHC I and recognized by CD8+ T cells as foreign. This explains why melanoma is among the most immunotherapy-responsive cancers. Patient B's low TMB (3 mut/Mb) means fewer neoantigens and less immune recognition. T CELL INFILTRATION: Patient A's tumor is 'inflamed' or 'hot' (35% CD8+ TILs), while Patient B's is 'cold' (8% CD8+). The inflamed phenotype, associated with a pre-existing anti-tumor immune response, is a strong predictor of checkpoint blockade response. PD-1 EXPRESSION: Counterintuitively, PD-1 expression on CD8+ TILs is a POSITIVE predictive marker \u2014 it indicates that these T cells have recognized tumor antigens and become activated but are being suppressed by the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint. Anti-PD-1 therapy releases this brake, reinvigorating these tumor-reactive T cells. Patient A has the highest PD-1+CD8+ percentage (20%), indicating many tumor-reactive T cells awaiting release from suppression. TREG RATIO: The CD8/Treg ratio captures the balance between anti-tumor immunity and immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. Patient B's ratio of 0.67 means Tregs outnumber effector CD8+ cells, creating a profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment that checkpoint blockade alone cannot overcome. Patient A's ratio of 7.0 indicates strong effector predominance. These multi-parameter approaches are now being integrated into clinical biomarker panels for immunotherapy patient selection.",

The experimental design should include: (1) GENETIC APPROACHES \u2014 IL-17A knockout mice test whether the key Th17 effector cytokine is required. IL-17RA knockout mice test whether the IL-17 receptor signaling pathway is required (this also captures IL-17F and other IL-17 family members). RORgammat conditional knockout in CD4+ T cells (using CD4-Cre x RORgammat-floxed mice) specifically ablates the Th17 lineage without affecting other RORgammat-expressing cells (like ILC3s), providing cell-type-specific evidence. (2) INFECTION MODEL \u2014 Oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis models the clinically relevant mucosal infection and allows quantitative assessment of fungal burden (colony-forming units from oral tissue homogenates), histological analysis of tissue invasion, neutrophil recruitment (critical downstream effector of IL-17 signaling on epithelial cells), and epithelial barrier integrity (tight junction protein expression). (3) RESCUE EXPERIMENT \u2014 Adoptive transfer of in vitro-differentiated wild-type Th17 cells into RORgammat conditional knockout mice should restore anti-Candida defense if Th17 cells are truly essential. This provides the strongest evidence, as it demonstrates both necessity (knockout phenotype) and sufficiency (rescue).

SENSITIZATION PHASE: IgE produced by B cells (driven by IL-4 from Th2 cells) binds with extremely high affinity (Ka approximately 10^10 M^-1) to FcepsilonRI on mast cell surfaces. The high-affinity receptor FcepsilonRI is a tetrameric complex (alpha-beta-gamma2) where the alpha chain binds IgE Fc, the beta chain contains one ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), and each gamma chain contains one ITAM. Mast cells are thus 'armed' with allergen-specific IgE. ACTIVATION PHASE: Upon re-exposure, multivalent allergen (must have at least two epitopes) crosslinks two or more IgE-FcepsilonRI complexes, causing receptor aggregation. This brings Lyn kinase (constitutively associated with the beta chain) into proximity, enabling it to phosphorylate ITAMs on both beta and gamma chains. Phosphorylated ITAMs recruit Syk kinase via its tandem SH2 domains. Activated Syk phosphorylates multiple downstream targets: (1) PLCgamma cleaves PIP2 to generate IP3 (releases ER calcium stores) and DAG (activates PKC).

However, they express low levels of MHC II on the surface (most is in intracellular MIIC compartments), low CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules, and low CCR7.

IFN-gamma is the key macrophage-activating cytokine \u2014 it enhances macrophage microbicidal activity (upregulating iNOS for nitric oxide production, NADPH oxidase for ROS), MHC II expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. TNF-alpha activates endothelium and promotes further immune cell recruitment. (4) Activated macrophages cause tissue damage through released proteases, ROS, and NO. The 24-72 hour delay reflects the time needed for: T cell recruitment from blood, clonal expansion at the site, macrophage recruitment via chemokines (CCL2/MCP-1), and macrophage activation. Clinical examples include contact dermatitis (poison ivy \u2014 CD8+ T cell-mediated), tuberculin reaction, granuloma formation (chronic DTH in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis), and graft rejection.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thymic involution is a programmed process beginning after puberty (accelerated by sex steroids, particularly androgens) where thymic epithelial space is progressively replaced by adipose tissue. By age 50, thymic output is reduced to approximately 10% of peak (adolescent) levels. Consequences include: (1) REDUCED NAIVE T CELL OUTPUT: Fewer recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), identifiable by T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs \u2014 circular DNA byproducts of V(D)J recombination that are diluted with each cell division). (2) CONTRACTED TCR REPERTOIRE: Fewer unique TCR specificities available to recognize novel antigens. (3) HOMEOSTATIC PROLIFERATION: To maintain peripheral T cell numbers despite reduced thymic output, existing naive T cells undergo slow homeostatic proliferation driven by IL-7 (survival cytokine) and low-affinity interactions with self-peptide/MHC complexes. This maintains cell numbers but gradually converts naive T cells to a 'virtual memory' phenotype with reduced diversity. (4) OLIGOCLONAL EXPANSION: The T cell repertoire becomes increasingly dominated by large clonal expansions of memory/effector T cells (often CMV-specific in humans), further restricting diversity. (5) IMMUNOSENESCENCE: Collectively, these changes impair responses to new pathogens and vaccines (explaining reduced influenza vaccine efficacy in elderly), increase susceptibility to infections, reduce cancer immunosurveillance, and may contribute to increased autoimmunity. Partial compensatory mechanisms include extra-thymic T cell development (limited) and the enormous initial diversity of the T cell repertoire (estimated 10^15-10^18 possible TCRs).",

Dose-response curves establish the effective concentration range. (2) CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) RISK: The major safety concern \u2014 engagement of CD3 causes polyclonal T cell activation, releasing massive amounts of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. In vitro cytokine release assays using whole blood or PBMC cultures with tumor cells predict CRS severity. CRS can be life-threatening (as seen with early CD28 superagonist TGN1412 trial).

Comprehensive immunohistochemistry screening of human tissue microarrays for TAA expression is essential. (4) PRECLINICAL MODELS: Standard syngeneic mouse models are inadequate because the bispecific antibody targets human CD3 and human TAA. Humanized mouse models (NSG/NOG mice engrafted with human immune cells plus human tumor xenografts) are required, though they imperfectly recapitulate human immune physiology.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic disorder that elegantly demonstrates the importance of complement regulation on self-surfaces. MOLECULAR BASIS: PNH results from somatic mutations in the PIGA gene (phosphatidylinositol glycan class A) in hematopoietic stem cells. PIGA encodes an enzyme essential for the first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. GPI anchors attach approximately 150 different proteins to cell membranes, including two critical complement regulators: CD55 (decay-accelerating factor, DAF) \u2014 accelerates decay of C3/C5 convertases on self-surfaces, and CD59 (protectin/MIRL) \u2014 blocks C9 insertion into the membrane attack complex, preventing MAC pore formation. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Without CD55 and CD59, erythrocytes from the PNH clone are exquisitely sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. The alternative complement pathway undergoes continuous low-level tick-over (spontaneous C3 hydrolysis), normally controlled on self-surfaces by regulators. On GPI-deficient PNH erythrocytes, this tick-over is amplified without regulation, leading to C3b deposition, C5 convertase formation, MAC assembly, and osmotic lysis. NOCTURNAL PAROXYSMS: During sleep, mild hypoventilation causes respiratory acidosis (slightly lower blood pH), which enhances complement activation. Additionally, a slight drop in plasma complement regulatory protein levels at night may contribute. Patients wake with hemoglobinuria (dark urine from free hemoglobin). TREATMENT: Eculizumab (anti-C5 monoclonal antibody) blocks terminal complement activation, preventing MAC formation and dramatically reducing hemolysis \u2014 one of the most dramatic examples of targeted therapy based on understanding of complement biology.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: M (microfold) cells are specialized epithelial cells in the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) overlying Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. They have a unique morphology: sparse, irregular microvilli (microfolds) on the apical surface, a thin cytoplasm, and a basolateral pocket containing dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages. M cells efficiently transcytose luminal antigens (particulate antigens, bacteria, viruses) from the intestinal lumen across the epithelium to the underlying immune cells. This is the primary mechanism for immune surveillance of gut luminal contents. Statement II is TRUE: Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin at mucosal surfaces (approximately 3-5 g produced daily in an adult \u2014 more than all other immunoglobulin classes combined). IgA is produced as a dimer by plasma cells in the lamina propria, linked by J chain. The dimeric IgA binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, is transcytosed to the apical surface, and released with a portion of the pIgR still attached \u2014 this portion is the secretory component (SC). The SC wraps around the IgA dimer, protecting it from proteolytic degradation by gut enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin), giving it a longer half-life in the harsh mucosal environment. Statement III is TRUE: The GALT contains an estimated 70-80% of all immune cells in the body, reflecting the enormous challenge of maintaining immune homeostasis at the gut mucosal surface (400 square meters of surface area, constant exposure to food antigens, commensal bacteria, and potential pathogens). Statement IV is FALSE: Oral tolerance is primarily a PERIPHERAL tolerance mechanism, not thymic. It involves multiple mechanisms in the gut: (1) induction of peripherally-induced Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (pTregs) by gut dendritic cells producing retinoic acid and TGF-beta, (2) T cell anergy (functional inactivation through TCR engagement without costimulation), and (3) clonal deletion of food-reactive T cells at high antigen doses.

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Trypanosoma brucei (causing African sleeping sickness) has evolved one of the most remarkable immune evasion strategies. Its surface is coated with approximately 10 million copies of a single variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The genome contains approximately 1,000-2,000 VSG genes (and pseudogenes), but only one is expressed at a time from a telomeric expression site. Periodically (approximately every 1-2 weeks), the parasite switches to expressing a different VSG through gene conversion, reciprocal recombination, or transcriptional switching. Each wave of parasitemia is cleared by IgM antibodies against the dominant VSG, but the switched variants escape, producing the characteristic relapsing fever pattern. Statement II is TRUE: M. tuberculosis is a masterful intracellular pathogen that subverts macrophage killing mechanisms. After phagocytosis, the mycobacterium arrests phagosome maturation at the early endosome stage through multiple mechanisms: secretion of lipid phosphatase SapM (dephosphorylates PI3P on the phagosome membrane), production of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) which interferes with calcium signaling required for phagosome maturation, and secretion of protein kinase G. The arrested phagosome maintains a near-neutral pH (approximately 6.4 versus 4.5 in a mature phagolysosome) and fails to acquire lysosomal enzymes and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species at bactericidal levels. Statement III is TRUE: HSV (and other herpesviruses like VZV) establish lifelong latency in sensory neuron ganglia (trigeminal or dorsal root ganglia). Neurons express very low levels of MHC I molecules, making them poor targets for CD8+ CTL recognition. During latency, viral gene expression is restricted to non-coding latency-associated transcripts (LATs) that inhibit apoptosis but produce no viral proteins, further reducing immune visibility. Statement IV is FALSE: Protein A binds IgG in the WRONG (inverse) orientation \u2014 it binds the Fc region at the CH2-CH3 interface, coating the bacterium with IgG molecules that have their Fab regions pointing outward (away from the bacterial surface) but their Fc regions bound to Protein A and therefore unavailable for recognition by Fc receptors on phagocytes. This PREVENTS opsonization and phagocytosis rather than enhancing it. It effectively camouflages the bacterium with non-functional antibodies.",

      "explanation": "These complement profiles illustrate how different complement deficiencies and consumption patterns produce distinct laboratory signatures. The CH50 (total hemolytic complement) assay measures the functional integrity of the entire classical pathway (C1 through C9 and MAC formation) \u2014 any single component deficiency in this pathway causes CH50 to be absent or severely reduced. PATIENT 1 (Low C3, Low C4, Low CH50): Both C3 and C4 are consumed, indicating activation through the CLASSICAL pathway (which consumes C4 first, then C3). This pattern is characteristic of immune complex diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where persistent immune complex formation drives continuous classical pathway activation, consuming both C4 (cleaved by C1s) and C3 (cleaved by C4b2a convertase). PATIENT 2 (Low C3, Normal C4, Low CH50): C3 is consumed but C4 is unaffected. This indicates ALTERNATIVE pathway activation (which uses factors B and D, bypassing C4 entirely) or a primary C3 deficiency/C3 nephritic factor (an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb, causing continuous C3 consumption). Examples include C3 glomerulonephritis and some forms of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. PATIENT 3 (Normal C3, Low C4, Low CH50): Isolated C4 consumption/deficiency with normal C3 suggests early CLASSICAL or LECTIN pathway involvement that has not yet significantly depleted C3 (or C4 is being consumed faster than C3), or hereditary C4 deficiency (the most common complement deficiency, associated with SLE susceptibility). It may also indicate C1-INH deficiency (hereditary angioedema), where unregulated C1s cleaves C4. PATIENT 4 (Normal C3, Normal C4, Absent CH50): Normal C3 and C4 with zero CH50 indicates a TERMINAL pathway component deficiency (C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9). Since all early components are present, but the functional assay (which requires complete MAC formation for erythrocyte lysis) fails completely, a single terminal component must be absent. This pattern is associated with increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections (meningococcal and gonococcal disease), as MAC-mediated killing is essential for defense against these gram-negative diplococci.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway is an elegant cellular system for displaying intracellular peptides (including viral proteins, tumor antigens, and self-proteins) to CD8+ T cells. THE PROTEASOME: Under normal conditions, the constitutive proteasome (20S core with catalytic subunits beta1, beta2, beta5) degrades ubiquitinated cytosolic proteins. During infection or inflammation, IFN-gamma induces replacement of these catalytic subunits with immunoproteasome subunits: LMP2 (beta1i), MECL-1 (beta2i), and LMP7 (beta5i). The immunoproteasome has altered cleavage preferences \u2014 it preferentially cleaves after hydrophobic and basic residues, generating peptides with C-terminal residues that are preferred anchor residues for MHC I binding. It also generates slightly longer peptides (10-12 amino acids) that can be further trimmed. TAP TRANSPORT: TAP (TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer) is an ABC transporter in the ER membrane. It translocates proteasome-generated peptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen in an ATP-dependent manner. TAP preferentially transports peptides of 8-16 amino acids with hydrophobic or basic C-terminal residues \u2014 matching the products of the immunoproteasome. PEPTIDE-LOADING COMPLEX (PLC): In the ER, the PLC (tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57, and TAP itself) facilitates peptide loading onto MHC I. Tapasin bridges TAP to MHC I, ensuring efficient peptide transfer. Calreticulin is a chaperone that stabilizes empty MHC I. ERp57 catalyzes disulfide bond formation. ERAAP (ER aminopeptidase) trims N-terminal extensions from peptides to optimal 8-9 amino acid length. Once loaded with a high-affinity peptide, MHC I-peptide complexes are released from the PLC and transported via the Golgi to the cell surface for CD8+ T cell surveillance.",

      "explanation": "Regulatory T cells (primarily CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs) employ multiple suppressive mechanisms, but IL-17 and IFN-gamma secretion is NOT one of them \u2014 these are pro-inflammatory effector cytokines produced by Th17 and Th1 cells respectively, and are antithetical to the suppressive function of Tregs. The well-established Treg suppression mechanisms include: (1) INHIBITORY CYTOKINES: IL-10 suppresses APC function (downregulating costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines); TGF-beta inhibits T cell proliferation and effector differentiation; IL-35 (heterodimer of IL-12alpha/EBI3, discovered more recently) suppresses effector T cell proliferation. (2) METABOLIC DISRUPTION (IL-2 deprivation): Tregs constitutively express CD25 (IL-2Ralpha), the high-affinity component of the IL-2 receptor. Since Tregs themselves do not produce IL-2 (Foxp3 actively represses IL-2 transcription), their high-level CD25 expression serves as a cytokine sink, consuming local IL-2 and depriving effector T cells of this essential survival and proliferation signal, potentially leading to Bim-dependent apoptosis. (3) CYTOLYSIS: Tregs can directly kill target cells. Human Tregs express granzyme A (and some granzyme B), which combined with perforin enables them to kill effector T cells and APCs. Mouse Tregs also express granzyme B. Additionally, FasL on Tregs can engage Fas on effector cells. (4) CTLA-4: Constitutively expressed CTLA-4 on Tregs competes with CD28 for B7 (CD80/CD86) binding on APCs, and can also capture and trans-endocytose B7 molecules from APC surfaces, physically removing costimulatory ligands.

      "explanation": "The mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) is a classic in vitro assay measuring T cell alloreactivity, and these data elegantly demonstrate the hierarchy of alloantigen recognition. STRAIN A (syngeneic control, PI = 1.0): Baseline \u2014 T cells do not respond to self-MHC, confirming tolerance. STRAIN B (fully MHC-mismatched, PI = 45.2): Maximal response when both MHC I and MHC II are foreign, as expected. STRAIN C (MHC II mismatched only, PI = 38.7): Nearly as high as the full mismatch, demonstrating that MHC II disparity is the DOMINANT driver of MLR proliferation. This is because: (1) The MLR predominantly measures CD4+ T cell proliferation (CD4+ cells are the major proliferating population in MLR). (2) CD4+ T cells recognize foreign MHC II molecules on the irradiated stimulator APCs (dendritic cells and B cells), generating a powerful proliferative response. (3) The high precursor frequency of alloreactive T cells (1-10% of the T cell repertoire) ensures a robust response. (4) Activated CD4+ T cells produce IL-2, driving autocrine and paracrine proliferation. STRAIN D (MHC I mismatched only, PI = 5.3): Much weaker response despite MHC I disparity. CD8+ T cells recognize foreign MHC I but proliferate poorly without CD4+ T cell help (IL-2). MHC I is expressed on all nucleated cells including the irradiated stimulators, but the CD8+ response in vitro is relatively weak in the absence of IL-2 from activated CD4+ cells. STRAIN E (minor H antigen differences, PI = 4.8): Minor histocompatibility antigens (peptides derived from polymorphic self-proteins presented on shared MHC molecules) elicit weak in vitro responses due to low precursor frequency of specific T cells. However, minor H antigen mismatches are clinically significant \u2014 they cause slow graft rejection even in MHC-matched transplants (as seen in HLA-identical sibling transplants requiring immunosuppression). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While MHC II drives in vitro proliferation, MHC I mismatches are critical for in vivo graft rejection because CD8+ CTLs are the primary effectors of acute cellular rejection, directly killing graft cells expressing foreign MHC I.",

      "explanation": "Testing the microbiome-immunotherapy connection requires a multi-phase approach establishing correlation, causation, and mechanism. PHASE 1 \u2014 CORRELATIVE STUDY: Collect pre-treatment stool samples from a cohort of cancer patients (ideally 100+ for statistical power) receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. 16S rRNA gene sequencing provides taxonomic composition (which bacteria are present and in what proportions), while shotgun metagenomics reveals functional gene content (metabolic pathways, virulence factors). Correlate microbiome alpha-diversity (species richness within samples), beta-diversity (differences between samples), and specific taxa with clinical endpoints: response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Multiple studies have identified Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium spp., and Ruminococcaceae as positively associated with anti-PD-1 response. PHASE 2 \u2014 CAUSATION (FMT in germ-free mice): Correlation is insufficient; causation must be established. Transfer fecal microbiota from responders (R-FMT) and non-responders (NR-FMT) into germ-free (axenic) mice. Implant syngeneic tumors and administer anti-PD-1 therapy. If the hypothesis is correct, R-FMT mice should show superior anti-tumor responses compared to NR-FMT mice. Controls should include: untreated germ-free mice (no FMT), conventional (non-germ-free) mice, and heat-killed FMT (to exclude viable bacteria effects). PHASE 3 \u2014 DEFINED CONSORTIA: Isolate candidate beneficial species identified in Phase 1 (by anaerobic culture) and colonize germ-free mice with defined bacterial communities to identify the specific species (or combinations) responsible. PHASE 4 \u2014 MECHANISM: Investigate how beneficial bacteria enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy: metabolomics to identify immunomodulatory metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, inosine), flow cytometry of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD8+ T cell activation, Treg proportion), and systemic immune markers. This approach has been validated by multiple groups and has led to clinical trials of FMT to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.",

        "Extensive HLA polymorphism (thousands of alleles at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ, -DP loci) is maintained by balancing selection because different HLA alleles present different subsets of pathogen-derived peptides; heterozygous individuals can present a broader range of pathogen peptides and thus mount more effective immune responses against diverse pathogens \u2014 this heterozygote advantage (overdominant selection) combined with frequency-dependent selection drives MHC diversification",
        "HLA polymorphism exists randomly and provides no selective advantage"

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The extraordinary polymorphism of HLA (MHC in other species) genes \u2014 with over 25,000 alleles identified across all HLA loci (HLA-B alone has over 6,000 known alleles) \u2014 makes them the most polymorphic genes in the human genome. This diversity is concentrated in the peptide-binding groove (particularly residues contacting bound peptides), and is maintained by several selective pressures. HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE (OVERDOMINANT SELECTION): Each HLA allele binds a specific set of peptides defined by anchor residue preferences (for example, HLA-A*02:01 preferentially binds peptides with leucine at position 2 and valine/leucine at the C-terminus). An individual heterozygous at all HLA loci can present approximately twice as many different pathogen-derived peptides as a homozygote. Population studies confirm that HLA-heterozygous individuals have lower viral set points in HIV infection, slower progression of hepatitis C, and better overall pathogen resistance. FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION: Pathogens evolve to evade common HLA alleles in a population (by mutating epitopes presented by those alleles). Rare HLA alleles therefore provide a selective advantage because pathogens have not yet evolved evasion strategies against them. As a rare allele increases in frequency (due to its advantage), pathogens adapt to it, reducing its advantage \u2014 this creates oscillating selection pressures that maintain many alleles at intermediate frequencies. PATHOGEN-DRIVEN SELECTION: Populations exposed to different pathogen environments show different HLA allele frequency distributions, reflecting local adaptation. For example, HLA-B*53 (associated with resistance to severe malaria) is common in West Africa but rare elsewhere. BALANCING SELECTION EVIDENCE: The HLA loci show an excess of non-synonymous substitutions in the peptide-binding region (dN > dS) \u2014 the opposite of most genes \u2014 indicating positive selection acting on the antigen-presenting function.",

B-1 CELLS: (1) Development: Arise primarily from fetal liver (and to some extent fetal bone marrow) progenitors, distinct from the bone marrow progenitors that generate conventional B-2 cells in adults. They self-renew in the peritoneal and pleural cavities throughout life. (2) Surface markers: CD5+ (B-1a) or CD5- (B-1b), IgM-high, IgD-low, CD23-low, CD43+. (3) Repertoire: Restricted, germline-encoded repertoire with minimal junctional diversity (limited N-nucleotide addition due to low TdT expression in fetal development). Enriched for polyreactive specificities that recognize conserved microbial determinants: phosphorylcholine (found in pneumococcal capsule and oxidized lipids), LPS, and phosphatidylcholine. (4) Function: Constitutively produce 'natural antibodies' \u2014 IgM (and some IgA) present in serum of unimmunized individuals. These natural IgM antibodies provide immediate defense against blood-borne bacteria, assist in clearance of apoptotic cells (recognizing oxidation-specific epitopes), and activate complement via the classical pathway. B-1a cells can respond without T cell help. MARGINAL ZONE B CELLS: (1) Location: Strategically positioned in the splenic marginal zone, where blood from the central arteriole drains into the marginal sinus \u2014 perfectly positioned to encounter blood-borne antigens. (2) Repertoire: Enriched for specificities against T-independent type 2 antigens (polysaccharide capsules of encapsulated bacteria \u2014 Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis). (3) Function: Rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts producing IgM (and some IgG) within days of antigen encounter, without requiring germinal center reactions or T cell help.

(4) Clinical significance: MZ B cells are absent in children under 2 years (explaining their susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria and the inefficacy of polysaccharide vaccines in infants \u2014 conjugate vaccines are needed).

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened but replication-competent pathogens (attenuated by serial passage in cell culture, cold adaptation, or targeted mutagenesis). Because they replicate within host cells, they: (1) activate innate immunity through authentic PAMPs, (2) generate intracellular antigens processed via MHC I pathway (activating CD8+ CTLs \u2014 critical for viral immunity), (3) produce extracellular antigens processed via MHC II (activating CD4+ T cells), (4) induce robust germinal center reactions with high-affinity antibodies and long-lived memory. Live vaccines often provide lifelong immunity after one or two doses (e.g., yellow fever vaccine provides immunity for 30+ years from a single dose), whereas inactivated vaccines typically require multiple boosters. Statement II is TRUE: This is a landmark achievement in vaccine development. Polysaccharide capsules of encapsulated bacteria (pneumococcus, meningococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b) are T-independent type 2 antigens \u2014 they crosslink BCRs on MZ B cells but cannot be processed and presented on MHC II (they are not proteins). Therefore, polysaccharide vaccines elicit only IgM responses without affinity maturation, class switching, or memory \u2014 and are completely ineffective in children under 2 (who lack mature MZ B cells). Conjugate vaccines chemically link the polysaccharide to an immunogenic carrier protein (tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid CRM197, or outer membrane protein complex). B cells specific for the polysaccharide internalize the conjugate via BCR, process the protein carrier, and present carrier-derived peptides on MHC II to carrier-specific Tfh cells, receiving T cell help. This converts the response to T-dependent, enabling germinal center reactions, IgG class switching, affinity maturation, and immunological memory \u2014 effective even in infants. Statement III is TRUE: mRNA vaccines represent a revolutionary platform. Lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated modified mRNA (containing N1-methylpseudouridine to reduce innate immune sensing) is taken up by cells at the injection site and draining lymph nodes. Host ribosomes translate the encoded antigen (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). The protein is: (1) degraded by proteasomes and presented on MHC I, activating CD8+ T cells; (2) secreted or released from cells and taken up by APCs for MHC II presentation, activating CD4+ T cells; (3) recognized in its native form by B cells, generating neutralizing antibodies. The mRNA itself also provides some adjuvant effect through innate RNA sensors. Statement IV is FALSE: Aluminum hydroxide (alum) does NOT directly activate T cells through the TCR. Instead, alum acts through multiple innate immune mechanisms: (1) depot effect \u2014 forming a slow-release antigen reservoir at the injection site; (2) activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to IL-1beta and IL-18 production; (3) inducing uric acid and host DNA release (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity; (4) enhancing antigen uptake by APCs; (5) activating complement. These innate signals enhance APC maturation, costimulatory molecule expression, and cytokine production, thereby INDIRECTLY enhancing T cell activation. Notably, alum preferentially induces Th2-biased responses and is poor at generating CD8+ CTL responses.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "These data provide a comprehensive demonstration of the master transcription factor paradigm in CD4+ T helper cell differentiation. T-BET KNOCKOUT: IFN-gamma production collapses to 9% of wild-type (45 vs 500 pg/mL), confirming T-bet as the essential master regulator of Th1 differentiation. T-bet (encoded by TBX21) directly transactivates the IFNG gene and remodels the IFN-gamma locus chromatin. Importantly, IL-4 production INCREASES dramatically (850 vs 300 pg/mL) \u2014 this reflects cross-regulation between lineages: T-bet normally suppresses GATA-3 expression and Th2 differentiation, so its absence removes this constraint, allowing enhanced Th2 polarization. IL-17 is minimally affected. GATA-3 KNOCKOUT: IL-4 production is virtually abolished (20 vs 300 pg/mL), confirming GATA-3 as the essential Th2 master regulator. GATA-3 directly transactivates IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 genes and remodels the Th2 cytokine locus. IFN-gamma slightly increases (620 vs 500) as the reciprocal Th2-mediated suppression of Th1 is relieved. IL-17 is modestly increased. RORGAMMAT KNOCKOUT: IL-17 production is essentially eliminated (15 vs 200 pg/mL), confirming RORgammat as the essential Th17 master regulator. RORgammat (encoded by RORC) binds enhancer elements in the IL17A and IL17F loci. IFN-gamma and IL-4 are minimally affected. FOXP3 KNOCKOUT \u2014 THE MOST STRIKING PHENOTYPE: Complete absence of Foxp3+ Tregs (0%) results in massive overproduction of ALL effector cytokines: IFN-gamma increases 2.4x, IL-4 increases 3x, IL-17 increases 4x compared to wild-type. This demonstrates that Tregs are not lineage-specific suppressors \u2014 they globally constrain all effector T cell populations through multiple mechanisms (IL-10/TGF-beta secretion, CTLA-4, IL-2 consumption). The Foxp3 knockout phenotype in mice (scurfy mutation) produces fatal multi-organ autoimmune disease within weeks of birth, and the human equivalent (IPEX syndrome \u2014 Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked) causes severe autoimmunity in infants.",

STEP 1 \u2014 GENOMIC CHARACTERIZATION: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor biopsy and matched normal tissue (blood) identifies somatic mutations (SNVs, indels, fusions) specific to the tumor. Melanoma typically has high TMB (10-50 mutations/Mb from UV mutagenesis), providing abundant candidate neoantigens. STEP 2 \u2014 EXPRESSION FILTERING: Not all mutated genes are expressed. RNA-seq of tumor tissue confirms which mutations are expressed and at what level. Only expressed mutations can generate neoantigens. STEP 3 \u2014 HLA TYPING: The patient's HLA type is determined (HLA-A, -B, -C for MHC I; HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ for MHC II), as neoantigen presentation is HLA-restricted. STEP 4 \u2014 NEOANTIGEN PREDICTION: Computational algorithms predict binding affinity of mutant peptides to the patient's HLA alleles. NetMHCpan and MHCflurry use neural networks trained on peptide-HLA binding data. Key criteria: predicted binding affinity less than 500 nM (strong binders less than 50 nM), mutation in an anchor or TCR-contact position, differential binding compared to the wild-type peptide (to ensure the mutation creates a 'neoepitope'). Typically 50-200 candidate neoantigens are identified from hundreds of mutations. STEP 5 \u2014 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION: (1) Peptide-HLA binding assays confirm computational predictions. (2) IFN-gamma ELISpot assays test whether patient PBMCs or TILs contain T cells reactive to candidate neoantigens. (3) HLA-peptide tetramers/multimers directly detect and quantify neoantigen-specific T cells. STEP 6 \u2014 VACCINE FORMULATION: Top validated neoantigens (typically 10-20) are formulated as: synthetic long peptides (SLPs, 15-30 amino acids, requiring processing by APCs, ensuring MHC I and II presentation), mRNA encoding neoantigen tandem minigenes (BioNTech/Moderna approach), or patient-derived dendritic cells pulsed with neoantigen peptides. Adjuvants (poly-ICLC, lipid nanoparticles for mRNA) enhance immune responses.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The 'missing self' hypothesis, proposed by Klas Karre in 1986, is a foundational concept in NK cell biology. NK cells constitutively express both ACTIVATING receptors (NKG2D recognizing stress-induced ligands MICA/MICB/ULBPs; natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, NKp46 recognizing viral hemagglutinins and other ligands; CD16/FcgammaRIII mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) and INHIBITORY receptors (killer immunoglobulin-like receptors/KIRs in humans recognizing HLA-A, -B, -C allotypes; Ly49 family in mice recognizing H-2 allotypes; NKG2A/CD94 heterodimer recognizing HLA-E presenting signal peptides from other HLA molecules). THE BALANCE MODEL: NK cell activation is determined by the integration of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors. On normal healthy cells: MHC I expression provides strong inhibitory signals through KIRs that override any activating signals \u2014 the cell is spared. On virus-infected cells: Many viruses downregulate MHC I to evade CD8+ T cell recognition (e.g., HIV Nef, CMV US2/US6/US11, adenovirus E3). Loss of MHC I removes inhibitory signals, shifting the balance toward activation \u2014 the infected cell is killed. On tumor cells: Chromosomal instability and immune editing frequently lead to MHC I loss or downregulation in cancer cells. Again, missing inhibitory ligands permit NK cell activation. ADDITIONAL ACTIVATION: Stressed cells (infected, transformed, or DNA-damaged) upregulate NKG2D ligands (MICA/B), further tilting the balance toward activation through 'induced self' recognition. This creates a complementary surveillance system: CD8+ T cells kill cells expressing foreign peptides ON MHC I, while NK cells kill cells that have LOST MHC I \u2014 together providing comprehensive immune surveillance against pathogens that either display or hide foreign antigens.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a critical effector mechanism that bridges humoral and cellular immunity, enabling innate immune cells to use antibody specificity for targeted killing. MECHANISM: (1) IgG antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of target cells (virus-infected cells, tumor cells, or parasites). (2) The Fc portions of the bound IgG molecules are recognized by FcgammaRIIIA (CD16), a low-affinity activating Fc receptor expressed on NK cells (the primary ADCC effectors), macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. (3) CD16 engagement triggers ITAM-dependent signaling (via associated FcRgamma chains) in the NK cell, leading to: cytoskeletal polarization toward the target, directed degranulation releasing perforin (forms transmembrane pores) and granzymes (serine proteases, particularly granzyme B, that enter through perforin pores and activate caspase-dependent apoptosis in the target cell). (4) NK cells also produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upon CD16 engagement, enhancing the immune response. THERAPEUTIC IMPORTANCE: ADCC is a major mechanism of action for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in cancer: Rituximab (anti-CD20 for B cell lymphomas), trastuzumab (anti-HER2 for breast cancer), and cetuximab (anti-EGFR for colorectal cancer) all depend significantly on ADCC. Patients with high-affinity CD16 polymorphisms (158V/V genotype) show better clinical responses to these antibodies. Glycoengineering of therapeutic antibodies to enhance Fc-CD16 binding (afucosylation) improves ADCC activity \u2014 obinutuzumab (glycoengineered anti-CD20) shows enhanced ADCC compared to rituximab.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is the best-characterized inflammasome and functions as a critical innate immune sensor of cellular damage and stress. NLRP3 STRUCTURE: NLRP3 protein contains three domains: an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) for ASC interaction, a central NACHT domain (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, providing ATPase activity for self-oligomerization), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs, involved in auto-inhibition and ligand sensing). ACTIVATION SIGNALS: Unlike other inflammasomes that sense specific PAMPs, NLRP3 is activated by remarkably diverse stimuli that converge on common cellular stress signals: (1) Extracellular ATP (released from dying cells) activating P2X7 receptor, causing potassium efflux \u2014 the common trigger. (2) Crystalline/particulate matter: uric acid (monosodium urate) crystals in gout, cholesterol crystals in atherosclerosis, silica particles in silicosis, asbestos, alum adjuvant. These are phagocytosed but cannot be degraded, causing lysosomal damage and cathepsin B release. (3) Mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial ROS, oxidized mitochondrial DNA, cardiolipin exposure. (4) Potassium efflux below approximately 90 mM intracellular K+ (via various mechanisms) appears to be the unifying signal. ASSEMBLY: Two-signal model \u2014 Signal 1 (priming): TLR activation (e.g., by LPS) upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1beta transcription via NF-kappaB. Signal 2 (activation): The danger signals listed above trigger NLRP3 conformational change, oligomerization, and recruitment of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) via PYD-PYD interactions. ASC polymerizes into large filamentous aggregates (ASC specks, visible by microscopy) that recruit pro-caspase-1 via CARD-CARD interactions. DOWNSTREAM: Proximity-induced auto-activation of caspase-1 (an inflammatory caspase, distinct from apoptotic caspases-3/7/9) leads to: cleavage of pro-IL-1beta (31 kDa) to mature IL-1beta (17 kDa) and pro-IL-18 to mature IL-18; cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) at the linker region, releasing the N-terminal domain that oligomerizes in the plasma membrane to form pores, causing pyroptosis \u2014 a lytic, inflammatory form of cell death that releases intracellular contents (including mature IL-1beta/IL-18 and DAMPs) into the extracellular space.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Immune privilege is an active, multi-layered process that limits immune responses within certain anatomically specialized sites to prevent collateral tissue damage from inflammation in organs with limited regenerative capacity. KEY MECHANISMS: (1) PHYSICAL BARRIERS: The blood-brain barrier (tight junctions between endothelial cells, astrocyte foot processes), blood-retinal barrier (retinal pigment epithelium tight junctions), and blood-testis barrier (Sertoli cell tight junctions) restrict immune cell transmigration and limit exposure of tissue antigens to the systemic immune system. (2) IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE FACTORS: Constitutive production of TGF-beta (suppresses T cell activation and promotes Treg induction), IL-10, alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone in the eye), VEGF, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the anterior chamber of the eye depletes local tryptophan, suppressing T cell proliferation. (3) FASL EXPRESSION: Cells in immune-privileged sites (Sertoli cells, retinal pigment epithelium, corneal epithelium) constitutively express FasL (CD95L), which induces apoptosis in Fas-expressing activated T cells that infiltrate the tissue \u2014 eliminating potentially damaging effector cells. (4) ALTERED LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE: The brain lacks conventional lymphatic vessels (though recently discovered glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic systems provide limited drainage to cervical lymph nodes). The anterior chamber of the eye drains to the spleen via the venous system rather than via conventional lymphatics, generating a unique tolerogenic response called ACAID (anterior chamber-associated immune deviation). (5) LOW MHC EXPRESSION: Neurons express very low MHC I, and most CNS cells express minimal MHC II under normal conditions. (6) LOCAL TREGS: Tissue-resident Tregs contribute to maintaining the immunosuppressive environment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Breakdown of immune privilege causes devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 sympathetic ophthalmia (trauma to one eye causes autoimmune attack on the contralateral eye), multiple sclerosis (CNS), and autoimmune orchitis (testes).",

Secreted IgM forms pentamers \u2014 five IgM monomers (each with two mu heavy chains) linked by J chain and disulfide bonds. This pentameric structure provides 10 antigen-binding sites (theoretically), conferring high avidity for repetitive epitopes (such as polysaccharide capsules of bacteria) despite relatively low individual binding affinity. Pentameric IgM is also extremely efficient at activating complement via the classical pathway \u2014 a single IgM pentamer binding to a surface can recruit C1q, whereas multiple IgG molecules are needed. Statement II is TRUE: Approximately 3-5 g of IgA is produced per day (compared to approximately 2 g of IgG), making it the most abundantly produced antibody. The majority of IgA is secretory IgA (sIgA) at mucosal surfaces \u2014 gut, respiratory tract, urogenital tract, breast milk, saliva, and tears. sIgA functions through immune exclusion: binding pathogens and toxins in the intestinal lumen, preventing their attachment to and penetration of the epithelial barrier, without triggering inflammation (unlike IgG-mediated complement activation or ADCC). Statement III is TRUE: IgG is unique in crossing the placenta, providing passive immunity to the fetus and neonate. FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor, structurally related to MHC I but with beta-2-microglobulin) is expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells. It binds IgG at acidic pH (pH 6.0-6.5 in endosomes after fluid-phase pinocytosis of maternal IgG), transcytoses it across the cell, and releases it at physiological pH (7.4) on the fetal side. FcRn binds at the CH2-CH3 interface of IgG, and its pH-dependent binding protects IgG from lysosomal degradation (also extending IgG half-life to approximately 21 days in adults). Statement IV is FALSE: IgD IS expressed on mature naive B cells \u2014 it is co-expressed with IgM on the surface of mature naive B cells in the periphery (through alternative RNA splicing of a primary transcript containing both Cmu and Cdelta). Surface IgD serves as a co-receptor for antigen alongside IgM. However, the function of secreted IgD (found at low levels in serum) remains poorly understood, with proposed roles in upper airway immunity and basophil activation.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: ILCs are a family of innate immune cells that mirror the adaptive T helper cell subsets in transcription factor usage and cytokine production, but lack antigen-specific receptors. ILC1s (including conventional NK cells as a related group) express T-bet and produce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, contributing to defense against intracellular pathogens (paralleling Th1 cells). ILC2s express GATA-3 and produce type 2 cytokines \u2014 IL-5 (eosinophil recruitment and activation), IL-13 (goblet cell mucus production, smooth muscle contraction), and IL-4 (to a lesser extent), paralleling Th2 cells. ILC3s express RORgammat and produce IL-17A and IL-22, critical for mucosal barrier defense, paralleling Th17 cells. Statement II is FALSE: This is a defining feature of ILCs \u2014 they are INNATE lymphoid cells that develop from common lymphoid progenitors but do NOT undergo RAG-dependent V(D)J recombination. They lack rearranged antigen receptors (no TCR, no BCR). Instead, they respond to cytokine signals and alarmin stimulation. This distinguishes them from T and B cells and allows them to respond rapidly without the delay required for clonal expansion of antigen-specific adaptive lymphocytes. ILCs are derived from Id2-dependent progenitors that suppress the B and T cell developmental programs. Statement III is TRUE: ILC2s are sentinel cells positioned at barrier surfaces (lung, gut, skin). They respond rapidly to epithelial-derived alarm signals: IL-33 (released from necrotic epithelial cells, signals via ST2/IL-1RL1), IL-25 (produced by tuft cells in the gut epithelium in response to helminth detection), and TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin, released by damaged epithelium). These alarmins activate ILC2s within hours, producing IL-5 and IL-13 that drive: eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia (increased mucus production), smooth muscle contraction \u2014 collectively promoting a 'weep and sweep' response that expels helminths. ILC2s are also major contributors to allergic inflammation, producing type 2 cytokines in asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. Statement IV is TRUE: ILC3s are particularly abundant in the intestinal lamina propria and are critical for maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Their key product, IL-22, acts on intestinal epithelial cells (which express the IL-22 receptor, IL-22R1/IL-10R2) to: upregulate regenerating islet-derived protein (RegIIIgamma, RegIIIbeta) \u2014 C-type lectins with direct bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria; enhance fucosylation of epithelial surface glycoproteins (promoting commensal colonization); stimulate mucin production (strengthening the mucus barrier); promote epithelial cell proliferation and wound healing.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "These laboratory data present a classic case of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), where each finding has a specific immunological and pathophysiological explanation. DIRECT COOMBS (DIRECT ANTIGLOBULIN) TEST: This test detects antibodies or complement components bound to the patient's red blood cells in vivo. Anti-human IgG reagent (Coombs reagent) is added to washed patient RBCs \u2014 agglutination indicates IgG autoantibodies coating the erythrocytes. In wAIHA, these are typically polyclonal IgG (usually IgG1 and/or IgG3) directed against Rh-system antigens (though often pan-reactive). Anti-C3d positivity indicates complement activation has occurred on the RBC surface \u2014 IgG1 and IgG3 are complement-fixing isotypes that recruit C1q and activate the classical pathway, depositing C3b (subsequently degraded to C3d) on the RBC membrane. INDIRECT COOMBS TEST: Detects free autoantibodies in the patient's serum \u2014 the serum contains autoantibodies that react with normal donor RBCs, confirming the autoimmune nature. SPHEROCYTES: The hallmark of extravascular hemolysis. Splenic macrophages express FcgammaRI (CD64) and FcgammaRIII (CD16) that bind IgG-coated RBCs. Rather than completely phagocytosing the RBC, macrophages often 'nibble' away portions of the IgG-coated membrane (a process called trogocytosis). The RBC loses surface area but retains volume, adopting a spherical shape (spherocyte) with reduced deformability. These rigid spherocytes become trapped in the splenic sinusoids during subsequent circulation and are ultimately phagocytosed \u2014 this is extravascular hemolysis. POLYCHROMASIA AND RETICULOCYTOSIS (12%): Reflects robust compensatory erythropoiesis. Erythropoietin production increases in response to anemia, stimulating bone marrow to release immature reticulocytes (which appear as polychromatic \u2014 bluish \u2014 cells on Wright-stained smears due to residual RNA). HEMOLYSIS MARKERS: Undetectable haptoglobin \u2014 haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin released from lysed RBCs; the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is cleared by hepatic macrophages via CD163 receptor. In active hemolysis, haptoglobin consumption exceeds hepatic production, causing undetectable levels. Elevated LDH (850 U/L) \u2014 released from lysed RBCs (LDH-1 and LDH-2 isoforms predominate). Indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia (4.2 mg/dL) \u2014 heme from degraded hemoglobin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin by heme oxygenase in macrophages, exceeding hepatic conjugation capacity.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "These data beautifully illustrate how different immunosuppressive therapies have distinct immunological targets, producing characteristic patterns of vaccine response impairment. HEALTHY CONTROLS: Robust antibody response (high anti-spike IgG and neutralizing titers) and detectable spike-specific T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+). This represents the full vaccine response: germinal center reactions generating high-affinity IgG, and T cell priming via MHC I (for CD8+) and MHC II (for CD4+) presentation of spike protein. RITUXIMAB-TREATED PATIENTS: Nearly absent antibody response (IgG 15 AU/mL, neutralizing titer below detection) but PRESERVED T cell responses (CD4+ 0.12%, CD8+ 0.07% \u2014 near-normal levels). Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells expressing CD20 (pre-B cells through mature B cells). This eliminates the B cell compartment needed for antibody production. However: (1) CD20 is NOT expressed on long-lived plasma cells (which reside in bone marrow), so pre-existing antibody production from prior exposures continues. (2) CD20 is NOT expressed on T cells, so T cell immunity is preserved. (3) The preserved T cell response is clinically significant \u2014 spike-specific CD8+ T cells can kill virus-infected cells, and CD4+ T cells provide cytokine-mediated protection, potentially offering some degree of vaccine-mediated protection even without antibodies. SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT (TRIPLE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION): Both antibody AND T cell responses are markedly reduced. The triple regimen targets multiple immune pathways: calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus/cyclosporine) block NFAT nuclear translocation, suppressing IL-2 production and T cell activation (explaining reduced CD4+ and CD8+ responses); antimetabolites (mycophenolate mofetil) inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, blocking de novo purine synthesis required for lymphocyte proliferation (affecting both T and B cells); corticosteroids broadly suppress NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory gene expression, reduce antigen presentation, and induce lymphocyte apoptosis. ANTI-TNF THERAPY: Moderately reduced but substantial antibody and T cell responses. TNF-alpha is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine in germinal center formation, FDC network maintenance, and lymphoid organogenesis, but it is not the primary driver of vaccine-induced antibody responses (IL-21 from Tfh cells, CD40-CD40L interactions, and IL-4/IL-6 are more critical). Therefore, anti-TNF therapy causes modest reduction in antibody titers without abolishing the vaccine response.",

      "explanation": "The discrepancy between natural infection and vaccine-induced immunity is a central challenge in vaccinology, and systematic comparison of immune responses can identify the missing protective components. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS: (1) ANTIBODY SPECIFICITY AND EPITOPE TARGETING: Natural infection exposes the immune system to multiple viral proteins in their native conformations during active viral replication, potentially generating antibodies against conformational epitopes, quaternary epitopes, and non-surface proteins. A subunit vaccine presenting only the surface protein may miss critical neutralizing epitopes that exist only in the context of the whole virus or in specific conformational states. Epitope mapping using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, peptide arrays, and competition ELISAs can identify differences in antibody targeting. (2) T CELL EPITOPE BREADTH: Natural infection generates T cell responses across the entire viral proteome \u2014 CD8+ CTLs recognize peptides from internal proteins (often more conserved than surface proteins), and CD4+ T cells recognize epitopes from multiple viral proteins. A surface protein vaccine limits T cell responses to that single protein. Overlapping peptide pool screening (using IFN-gamma ELISpot or intracellular cytokine staining) across the entire proteome vs. surface protein reveals whether natural infection generates broader T cell responses. (3) GERMINAL CENTER QUALITY: Fine needle aspiration of draining lymph nodes (a technique increasingly used in human vaccine studies) allows direct analysis of germinal center B cells (GL7+Fas+) and Tfh cells (CXCR5+PD-1+ICOS+) \u2014 measuring GC magnitude and duration, which determine antibody quality. Natural infection may induce more prolonged GC reactions due to sustained antigen presentation. (4) MEMORY B CELL QUALITY: Single-cell BCR sequencing reveals somatic hypermutation levels (indicating affinity maturation quality) and clonal diversity. Natural infection may select for broader, more highly mutated memory B cell clones. (5) TISSUE-RESIDENT MEMORY T CELLS (TRM): These non-circulating memory T cells (CD69+CD103+ in mucosal tissues) provide critical frontline defense at the portal of entry. Natural infection seeds TRM in relevant tissues (respiratory mucosa for respiratory viruses), while intramuscular vaccination may fail to generate mucosal TRM \u2014 this could explain the 'durability gap'.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Eosinophils are the primary effector cells against multicellular helminth parasites, which are too large to be phagocytosed. RECRUITMENT: Type 2 immune responses (driven by Th2 cells and ILC2s) produce: IL-5 \u2014 the major eosinophil growth, differentiation, activation, and survival factor (produced by Th2 cells and ILC2s); eotaxins (CCL11, CCL24, CCL26) \u2014 chemokines specific for eosinophil recruitment via CCR3; IL-4 and IL-13 promote IgE class switching in B cells, generating helminth-specific IgE. ATTACHMENT TO HELMINTHS: Eosinophils express multiple Fc receptors: FcepsilonRI (binds IgE coating the helminth surface), FcgammaRII (CD32, binds IgG), and complement receptors (CR1, CR3 for C3b/iC3b-coated targets). This enables antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against helminths. GRANULE PROTEINS: Eosinophil granules are distinctive (crystalloid cores visible by EM) containing four major toxic proteins: (1) Major basic protein (MBP) \u2014 the most abundant, constituting approximately 50% of granule protein. MBP is highly cationic (pI >11), directly toxic to helminth tegument by disrupting lipid bilayers and increasing membrane permeability. Also toxic to mammalian cells (contributing to tissue damage in asthma). (2) Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) \u2014 an RNase with direct cytotoxicity, creates transmembrane pores in target cell membranes, and has bactericidal activity. (3) Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) \u2014 catalyzes the oxidation of halides (bromide, preferentially) by H2O2 to produce hypohalous acids (HOBr), causing oxidative damage to helminth surfaces. The eosinophil peroxidase system (EPO + H2O2 + halide) is analogous to the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system but uses bromide rather than chloride. (4) Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) \u2014 an RNase with antiviral activity against ssRNA viruses. DEGRANULATION MECHANISM: Eosinophils undergo piecemeal degranulation (selective release of granule contents via vesicular transport) or cytolytic degranulation (release of intact granules as 'free extracellular granules' that retain functional receptors and continue releasing toxic proteins after eosinophil death). They also form extracellular DNA traps (EETs), similar to neutrophil NETs, that can entangle and immobilize helminths.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Tumor immune evasion is a multi-faceted process resulting from the selective pressure of immune surveillance (immunoediting). The three phases of cancer immunoediting are: Elimination (immune system destroys immunogenic tumor cells), Equilibrium (balance between immune control and tumor survival), and Escape (tumor variants emerge that can evade immune destruction). EVASION MECHANISMS: (1) MHC I DOWNREGULATION: Loss or downregulation of MHC I expression (through mutations in beta-2-microglobulin, TAP, or HLA genes, or epigenetic silencing) prevents CD8+ CTL recognition. This is found in approximately 40-90% of tumors depending on type. However, MHC I loss makes cells susceptible to NK cell killing ('missing self'), so tumors often downregulate rather than completely lose MHC I expression to balance these pressures. (2) PD-L1 EXPRESSION: Tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells upregulate PD-L1 (B7-H1), which engages PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells, delivering inhibitory signals that promote T cell exhaustion (loss of effector function, reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis). This 'adaptive immune resistance' mechanism \u2014 where tumors upregulate PD-L1 in response to IFN-gamma from tumor-reactive T cells \u2014 is the basis for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. (3) IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CYTOKINES: TGF-beta suppresses CTL and NK cell cytotoxicity and promotes Treg differentiation. IL-10 inhibits APC function. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibits dendritic cell maturation and promotes angiogenesis creating an abnormal vasculature that limits T cell infiltration. (4) SUPPRESSIVE CELL RECRUITMENT: Tregs (attracted by CCL22) suppress anti-tumor effector T cells. MDSCs (attracted by CSF-1, CCL2, CXCL5) suppress T cells through arginase-1 (depleting arginine), iNOS (producing NO), ROS production, and IL-10/TGF-beta secretion. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs, predominantly M2-polarized) promote angiogenesis and matrix remodeling while suppressing anti-tumor immunity. (5) IDO: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase catabolizes tryptophan to kynurenines, depleting this essential amino acid from the tumor microenvironment (activating GCN2 kinase-mediated T cell anergy) while generating immunosuppressive kynurenine metabolites that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in T cells, promoting Treg differentiation. (6) ANTIGEN LOSS (IMMUNOEDITING): Under immune selection pressure, tumor cell variants that have lost (through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing) the specific antigens recognized by anti-tumor T cells survive and expand, resulting in immune escape through antigen-loss variants.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Thymic selection is an extraordinary quality control process that shapes the T cell repertoire for self-MHC restriction and self-tolerance, sacrificing approximately 95-98% of developing thymocytes. POSITIVE SELECTION (thymic cortex): Double-positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes that have successfully rearranged their TCR alpha chain (following productive TCR beta chain rearrangement) interact with cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). cTECs are unique in using thymoproteasome (beta5t catalytic subunit) for MHC I peptide generation and cathepsin L (instead of cathepsin S) for MHC II peptide generation, producing a unique peptide repertoire for selection. Thymocytes whose TCR can bind self-peptide/MHC with moderate affinity receive survival signals through the TCR \u2192 Lck \u2192 ZAP-70 \u2192 Ras \u2192 ERK MAPK cascade, upregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and downregulating pro-apoptotic Bim. Those with non-functional TCRs (cannot bind any self-MHC) receive no survival signals and die by neglect (apoptosis by default within 3-4 days) \u2014 this eliminates approximately 80-90% of thymocytes. Lineage commitment: thymocytes positively selected on MHC II downregulate CD8 and become CD4+ single-positive T cells; those selected on MHC I downregulate CD4 and become CD8+ single-positive T cells. This decision involves the kinetic signaling model and transcription factors ThPOK (for CD4) and Runx3 (for CD8). NEGATIVE SELECTION (thymic medulla): Surviving single-positive thymocytes migrate to the medulla, where they interact with medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and thymic dendritic cells. mTECs uniquely express AIRE (autoimmune regulator) transcription factor, which drives promiscuous gene expression \u2014 expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) from virtually every organ (insulin, thyroglobulin, myelin basic protein, liver-specific enzymes, etc.) in the thymus. Thymocytes whose TCR binds these self-peptide/MHC complexes with HIGH affinity are self-reactive and dangerous \u2014 they undergo clonal deletion via Bim-dependent apoptosis (BH3-only protein Bim activates Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization). Alternatively, some high-affinity self-reactive CD4+ thymocytes are diverted to become natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) \u2014 expressing Foxp3, CD25, and CTLA-4 \u2014 rather than being deleted. Approximately 50-70% of positively selected cells are eliminated by negative selection. The net result: only 2-5% of original DP thymocytes survive both selections and exit as naive T cells.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-characterized family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), providing the first line of innate immune defense through recognition of conserved microbial structures (PAMPs). There are 10 human TLRs (TLR1-10) and 12 mouse TLRs (TLR1-9, TLR11-13). CELL SURFACE TLRs: TLR1 (heterodimerizes with TLR2): triacyl lipopeptides; TLR2: peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, zymosan, lipoproteins; TLR4: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \u2014 the prototypic PAMP. TLR4 recognition of LPS requires a complex of accessory molecules: LPS-binding protein (LBP) transfers LPS to CD14 (GPI-anchored or soluble), which loads LPS onto MD-2 (a small protein associated with TLR4). LPS-MD-2 induces TLR4 dimerization and signaling. TLR5: bacterial flagellin; TLR6 (heterodimerizes with TLR2): diacyl lipopeptides. ENDOSOMAL TLRs: TLR3: double-stranded RNA (viral replication intermediate); TLR7: single-stranded RNA (from ssRNA viruses \u2014 influenza, HIV, HCV); TLR8: single-stranded RNA (similar to TLR7 but distinct expression pattern); TLR9: unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (abundant in bacterial and viral DNA, rare in vertebrate DNA due to CpG methylation). The endosomal localization serves two purposes: (1) it positions these TLRs to detect nucleic acids released from degraded intracellular pathogens in endolysosomes; (2) it prevents recognition of self-DNA/RNA in the cytoplasm. SIGNALING PATHWAYS: All TLRs signal through one or both of two adaptor proteins: MyD88-DEPENDENT pathway (all TLRs except TLR3): MyD88 \u2192 IRAK1/4 \u2192 TRAF6 \u2192 TAK1 \u2192 IKK complex \u2192 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation \u2192 pro-inflammatory gene transcription (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, chemokines); also activates MAPK pathways (JNK, p38, ERK).

TLR4 is unique in using both pathways: MyD88-dependent signaling from the cell surface (immediate NF-kappaB activation) and TRIF-dependent signaling after TLR4 internalization into endosomes (delayed IFN-beta production).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a specialized CD4+ T cell subset essential for germinal center (GC) formation and high-quality antibody responses. Without Tfh cells, germinal centers do not form, and B cell responses are limited to short-lived, low-affinity, unmutated IgM. DEFINING MARKERS: (1) CXCR5: The chemokine receptor for CXCL13 (also called BLC, B lymphocyte chemoattractant), constitutively produced by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and follicular stromal cells. CXCR5 expression allows Tfh cells to migrate from the T cell zone into the B cell follicle. (2) Bcl-6: The master transcription factor for Tfh differentiation. Bcl-6 represses Blimp-1 (which would promote effector T cell differentiation) and induces CXCR5, PD-1, and other Tfh genes. (3) PD-1 (high level): While PD-1 is associated with exhaustion on effector T cells, on Tfh cells it plays a regulatory role \u2014 PD-1 signaling fine-tunes the stringency of GC B cell selection, ensuring that only high-affinity B cells receive survival signals. (4) ICOS: Inducible co-stimulator, essential for Tfh differentiation, migration, and function. ICOS deficiency in humans causes common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with absent germinal centers. (5) SAP (SLAM-associated protein): Required for stable T-B cell conjugate formation at the T-B border. SAP deficiency (X-linked lymphoproliferative disease) prevents GC formation. TFH FUNCTIONS IN GERMINAL CENTERS: (1) CD40L-CD40 interaction: Tfh cells express CD40L (CD154) which engages CD40 on GC B cells. This is the ESSENTIAL signal for GC maintenance \u2014 without it (as in CD40L-deficient hyper-IgM syndrome), patients have no germinal centers, no class switching, no somatic hypermutation, and no memory B cells. CD40 signaling activates NF-kappaB and upregulates AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), the enzyme required for both somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. (2) IL-21: The signature Tfh cytokine, IL-21 drives GC B cell proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and Bcl-6 expression in GC B cells. IL-21 signals through STAT3 in B cells. (3) IL-4: Tfh-derived IL-4 promotes IgG1 and IgE class switching. (4) AFFINITY-BASED SELECTION: Tfh cells provide help preferentially to B cells presenting more peptide-MHC II (indicating higher-affinity BCR and more efficient antigen capture from FDCs).

KEY FINDINGS: (1) Normal to elevated neutrophil count (10,336/microL) \u2014 this eliminates neutropenia as the cause of recurrent infections. Phagocyte NUMBERS are normal; the defect is in phagocyte FUNCTION. (2) NEGATIVE NBT TEST: The NBT test is a screening test for NADPH oxidase function. Normal neutrophils, when stimulated (e.g., with PMA), generate superoxide (O2-) via the NADPH oxidase (also called phagocyte oxidase/phox). Superoxide reduces yellow nitroblue tetrazolium dye to blue-purple formazan crystals, visible microscopically. In CGD, the respiratory burst is absent \u2014 NBT remains unreduced (yellow). (3) ABSENT DHR SHIFT: Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) flow cytometry is the more sensitive and quantitative confirmatory test. DHR is oxidized to fluorescent rhodamine 123 by hydrogen peroxide (generated from superoxide by SOD). Normal neutrophils show a fluorescence shift upon PMA stimulation; CGD neutrophils show no shift. DHR flow cytometry can also distinguish X-linked carriers (bimodal fluorescence pattern \u2014 some neutrophils from the normal X and some from the mutant X due to random X-inactivation). MOLECULAR BASIS: NADPH oxidase is a multi-component enzyme complex: membrane components \u2014 gp91phox (also called NOX2, encoded by CYBB on X chromosome) and p22phox (CYBA) forming cytochrome b558; cytosolic components \u2014 p47phox (NCF1), p67phox (NCF2), p40phox (NCF4), and the small GTPase Rac2. Upon activation, cytosolic components translocate to the phagosomal membrane and assemble with cytochrome b558 to form the active oxidase. X-linked CGD (approximately 65% of cases): mutations in CYBB (gp91phox) \u2014 the most severe form. Autosomal recessive CGD: mutations in p47phox (approximately 25%), p67phox (approximately 5%), p22phox (approximately 5%), or rarely p40phox. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Without superoxide production, neutrophils and macrophages cannot generate the reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid via myeloperoxidase) needed to kill catalase-positive bacteria and fungi (Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia marcescens, Aspergillus species, Nocardia). Catalase-negative organisms (Streptococcus) produce their own H2O2 which can partially compensate for the oxidase defect. The characteristic granulomas form because macrophages containing live bacteria recruit more macrophages, creating organized inflammatory aggregates (epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells) \u2014 the body's attempt to wall off persistent infections it cannot clear.",

(2) WHITE PULP: Organized immune tissue surrounding central arterioles: periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) \u2014 T cell zone surrounding the central arteriole, containing dendritic cells for antigen presentation; B cell follicles \u2014 primary follicles with naive B cells, secondary follicles with germinal centers during active immune responses; marginal zone \u2014 between the red and white pulp, containing specialized marginal zone B cells and marginal zone macrophages. (3) MARGINAL ZONE: Strategically positioned where arterial blood first enters the open splenic circulation, the marginal zone is perfectly located to encounter blood-borne antigens. Marginal zone B cells are pre-activated innate-like B cells enriched for polyreactive specificities against T-independent type 2 antigens (polysaccharide capsules). They rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts producing IgM within 1-3 days without requiring germinal center reactions or T cell help. POST-SPLENECTOMY SEPSIS (OPSI): Splenectomy increases risk of overwhelming infection by encapsulated bacteria \u2014 S. pneumoniae (most common, approximately 50-90% of OPSI cases), H. influenzae type b, and N. meningitidis. The risk is highest in the first 2 years post-splenectomy but persists lifelong. The mortality rate of OPSI is 50-70% even with treatment. Reasons for increased susceptibility: (1) Loss of marginal zone B cells eliminates rapid IgM responses to capsular polysaccharides. (2) Loss of splenic macrophage filtration function means poorly opsonized bacteria (encapsulated bacteria resist complement opsonization) persist in the bloodstream. (3) Loss of IgM memory B cells (predominantly splenic) reduces recall responses. Prevention includes vaccination against encapsulated organisms (PCV13, PPSV23, MenACWY, Hib), prophylactic antibiotics (particularly in children), and patient education about seeking immediate medical attention for fevers.",

        "Both CSR and SHM require activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), but they target different regions: SHM introduces point mutations in the variable region exons (V, D, J segments) to alter antigen-binding affinity, while CSR is a deletional recombination event between switch (S) regions upstream of constant region genes (Cmu, Cgamma, Calpha, Cepsilon), changing the antibody isotype while preserving the same variable region \u2014 CSR is directed by cytokine signals (IL-4 promotes switching to IgE/IgG4, IFN-gamma promotes IgG1/IgG3, TGF-beta promotes IgA)",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are two distinct AID-dependent processes that modify the immunoglobulin genes in germinal center B cells, each serving a different purpose. AID (ACTIVATION-INDUCED CYTIDINE DEAMINASE): Both processes require AID, an enzyme that deaminates cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA exposed during transcription. AID deficiency causes hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 \u2014 no class switching and no somatic hypermutation, resulting in only low-affinity IgM production. SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION (SHM): AID targets the V(D)J region of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. It deaminates cytosines in the variable region (concentrated in complementarity-determining regions/CDRs, particularly CDR1 and CDR2 \u2014 targeting is influenced by hotspot motifs WRCY/RGYW). The resulting U:G mismatches are processed by error-prone repair pathways: (1) Base excision repair (BER): UNG (uracil-DNA glycosylase) removes the uracil, creating an abasic site replicated over by error-prone polymerases (Rev1, Pol eta). (2) Mismatch repair (MMR): MSH2/MSH6 recognizes the U:G mismatch, recruits error-prone polymerase eta (Pol eta) which introduces additional mutations, especially at A:T base pairs. The net result is approximately 10^-3 mutations per base pair per cell division (approximately 1 million-fold higher than background somatic mutation rate) concentrated in the variable region. This generates B cell clones with altered antigen-binding affinity \u2014 those with improved affinity are positively selected by Tfh cells in the germinal center light zone. CLASS SWITCH RECOMBINATION (CSR): AID targets switch (S) regions \u2014 repetitive GC-rich sequences located upstream of each constant region gene (Smu, Sgamma3, Sgamma1, Sgamma2b, Sgamma2a, Sepsilon, Salpha in mice). Cytokine signals from T cells induce germline transcription of specific S regions, making them accessible to AID. For example: IL-4 induces germline transcription of Sgamma1 and Sepsilon (promoting IgG1 and IgE switching in mice; IgG4 and IgE in humans); IFN-gamma induces Sgamma2a transcription (IgG2a switching in mice; IgG1/IgG3 in humans); TGF-beta induces Salpha transcription (IgA switching). AID deaminates cytosines in both the donor S region (Smu) and the target S region, creating U:G mismatches processed by BER/MMR to generate double-strand breaks (DSBs). These DSBs are joined by classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) or alternative end joining, creating a chromosomal deletion loop containing the intervening constant region genes. The result: the same V(D)J region is now juxtaposed to a different constant region gene, producing antibodies with the same antigen specificity but different effector functions (isotype).",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Fever represents a coordinated thermoregulatory response. The process begins when macrophages and other immune cells activated by PAMPs produce endogenous pyrogens \u2014 primarily IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These cytokines reach the brain via circumventricular organs (areas lacking a complete blood-brain barrier, particularly the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis/OVLT). They induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in brain endothelial cells and perivascular macrophages, producing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 acts on EP3 receptors in the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus (the body's thermostat), raising the temperature set point. The hypothalamus then coordinates heat conservation (peripheral vasoconstriction, behavioral changes \u2014 seeking warmth, curling up) and heat production (shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering thermogenesis via brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein-1) until core temperature reaches the new set point. This is why patients feel 'chills' during the rising phase of fever \u2014 their core temperature is below the elevated set point. Statement II is TRUE: The hepatic acute phase response is a systemic metabolic reprogramming driven primarily by IL-6 (signaling through IL-6R/gp130 and STAT3). Key acute phase proteins include: C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2014 binds phosphorylcholine on damaged cells and bacteria, activates complement classical pathway (via C1q), and enhances phagocytosis (opsonization). CRP can increase 100-1000-fold within 24-48 hours \u2014 the most clinically useful acute phase marker. Serum amyloid A (SAA) \u2014 displaces apolipoprotein A-I from HDL, creating pro-inflammatory HDL; also a chemoattractant for neutrophils. Fibrinogen \u2014 increases coagulation, contributes to erythrocyte rouleaux formation (elevated ESR). Complement components (C3, C4, factor B) \u2014 increased complement production enhances opsonization and pathogen lysis. Mannose-binding lectin \u2014 enhanced lectin pathway complement activation. Negative acute phase proteins (albumin, transferrin) DECREASE, redirecting hepatic protein synthesis toward defense. Statement III is TRUE: Moderate fever has documented immunological benefits: (1) Enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (T cells show increased IL-2 production and responsiveness at 39 degrees C). (2) Increased neutrophil migration, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst. (3) Enhanced dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation. (4) Increased IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha activity. (5) Enhanced heat shock protein (HSP) expression, which can serve as danger signals and enhance antigen presentation. (6) Many bacteria grow optimally at 37 degrees C; fever creates a suboptimal growth environment. Evolutionary conservation of fever across vertebrates and invertebrates (behavioral fever in ectotherms) strongly supports its adaptive value. Statement IV is FALSE: As described above, fever has documented immunological benefits and evolutionary conservation strongly supports its adaptive function. Clinical studies suggest that antipyretic therapy in certain infections may prolong illness. However, very high fever (greater than 41 degrees C) or fever in specific contexts (febrile seizures in children, compromised cardiac patients, heatstroke) may require treatment. The blanket suppression of all fevers is not evidence-based.",

      "explanation": "These data present a classic CVID immunophenotype with detailed B cell subset analysis revealing the specific level of immune defect. CVID DIAGNOSIS CRITERIA: This patient meets all three ESID/PAGID diagnostic criteria: (1) Marked decrease in IgG (120 mg/dL, less than 2 SD below mean for age) with at least one of low IgA (less than 7 mg/dL) or low IgM (25 mg/dL). (2) Poor or absent response to vaccines (both polysaccharide AND protein antigens \u2014 important distinction from specific antibody deficiency). (3) Exclusion of other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. B CELL SUBSET ANALYSIS: The most informative aspect of these data. Total CD19+ B cells are present (8%, within low-normal range), ruling out agammaglobulinemia (where B cells are absent, as in X-linked agammaglobulinemia/BTK deficiency). Memory B cells (CD27+) are severely reduced (1.2% vs 15-40%), and switched memory B cells (CD27+IgD-IgM-) are virtually absent (0.3% vs 6-25%). This indicates a profound defect in germinal center-dependent B cell differentiation \u2014 the process requiring: (1) T cell help (CD40L-CD40 interaction, cytokine signals from Tfh cells), (2) AID-mediated class switch recombination, (3) Somatic hypermutation and affinity-based selection, (4) Differentiation into memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. The Freiburg classification of CVID uses switched memory B cell percentage as a key prognostic marker: Group I (less than 0.4% switched memory) has the highest rate of granulomatous disease, autoimmune cytopenias, and splenomegaly. FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES: Without class-switched memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells: IgG is severely reduced (small contribution from residual unswitched B cells and possibly pre-existing long-lived plasma cells); IgA is nearly absent (requires switching to Calpha); IgM is low but detectable (can be produced without class switching). Absent vaccine responses to both polysaccharide (T-independent \u2014 marginal zone B cell function) AND protein (T-dependent \u2014 germinal center function) antigens confirm the comprehensive B cell functional defect. T CELL COMPARTMENT: Normal CD3+ percentage and CD4/CD8 ratio argue against a primary T cell deficiency as the cause. However, subtle T cell defects (particularly Tfh cell dysfunction) are found in some CVID patients and may contribute to the germinal center failure. MOLECULAR HETEROGENEITY: CVID is genetically heterogeneous \u2014 identified genetic causes include: ICOS deficiency (impaired Tfh function), TACI (TNFRSF13B) mutations (most common, approximately 8-10%), BAFF-R mutations, CD19/CD81/CD21 complex mutations, CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency, LRBA deficiency, PIK3CD gain-of-function (APDS), NFKB1/NFKB2 mutations. However, in approximately 75% of CVID patients, no monogenic cause is identified, suggesting polygenic or complex genetic architecture.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The hygiene hypothesis, originally proposed by David Strachan in 1989 (observing that children with more older siblings had less hay fever), has evolved into a sophisticated framework explaining the rising incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed countries. ORIGINAL FORMULATION: The initial version proposed a simple Th1/Th2 balance \u2014 infections (driving Th1 responses) suppress Th2-mediated allergies. This was too simplistic because: (1) Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes, MS, Crohn's disease) have also increased. (2) Helminth infections (strongly Th2-polarizing) are protective against both allergies AND autoimmune diseases. UPDATED 'OLD FRIENDS' HYPOTHESIS (Graham Rook): The key insight is that certain organisms with which humans co-evolved ('old friends' \u2014 helminths, saprophytic mycobacteria, commensal gut bacteria) are essential for proper immune regulation during development. These organisms promote REGULATORY pathways: (1) Regulatory T cells (Tregs): Helminths actively induce CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs through TGF-beta and IL-10 production. Helminth-induced Tregs suppress both Th2 (allergic) and Th1/Th17 (autoimmune) responses. Epidemiological data: helminth-endemic regions have lower rates of allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes. (2) Tolerogenic dendritic cells: Diverse microbial exposure promotes DCs that produce IL-10 and TGF-beta (rather than IL-12), favoring peripheral tolerance over inflammatory responses. (3) Microbiome diversity: The gut microbiome educates the developing immune system. Specific commensals (Bacteroides fragilis PSA, Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) promote colonic Treg differentiation via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (butyrate, propionate, acetate). SCFAs enhance Foxp3 expression through HDAC inhibition and GPR43/GPR109A signaling on T cells and DCs. (4) Training of regulatory circuits: Early-life microbial exposure is critical during an immune development window. Germ-free mice have impaired immune regulation, increased IgE, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases \u2014 colonization in early life (but not adult life) can restore normal regulation, supporting the 'critical window' concept. EVIDENCE: Countries undergoing rapid westernization show rising allergy/autoimmune rates (migration studies confirm environmental rather than genetic basis). Farm children (exposed to diverse environmental microbes) have lower allergy rates than urban children. Antibiotic use in early life increases allergy risk. Clinical trials of helminth therapy (Trichuris suis ova) show some efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The immunological distinction between apoptosis and necrosis is fundamental to understanding tissue homeostasis and pathology. APOPTOSIS (PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH): Apoptosis is a tightly regulated, energy-dependent process designed to eliminate cells without triggering inflammation \u2014 critical because approximately 10 billion cells die by apoptosis daily in a healthy adult (homeostatic turnover). Key features: (1) Cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation (pyknosis), DNA fragmentation (200 bp nucleosomal ladder by caspase-activated DNase/CAD). (2) Membrane blebbing with formation of apoptotic bodies \u2014 membrane-bound fragments containing condensed organelles. (3) CRITICAL: Membrane integrity is maintained throughout \u2014 no leakage of intracellular contents. (4) Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure: normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by flippases, PS is externalized during apoptosis (by activated scramblases and caspase-mediated flippase inactivation). Exposed PS is the primary 'eat-me' signal recognized by: TIM-4 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-4) on macrophages; MerTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) via its bridging molecule Gas6; Stabilin-2; TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, Mer). (5) Efferocytosis: phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells actively induces ANTI-INFLAMMATORY signaling in macrophages \u2014 TGF-beta, IL-10, and PGE2 production; suppression of TNF-alpha and IL-12. This ensures immunological silence. (6) If apoptotic cells are NOT cleared efficiently (as in SLE, where defective efferocytosis is a pathogenic factor), they undergo secondary necrosis and release nuclear antigens, potentially triggering autoimmunity. NECROSIS (UNCONTROLLED CELL DEATH): Results from physical/chemical trauma, ischemia, extreme stress. Key features: (1) Cell swelling (oncosis), organelle swelling, and PLASMA MEMBRANE RUPTURE \u2014 the critical event. (2) Release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. (3) DAMPs activate innate immune sensors: HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) \u2014 normally a nuclear protein that binds DNA; when released extracellularly, it activates TLR4 and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). ATP \u2014 released through ruptured membranes, activates P2X7 receptors on macrophages, triggering NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL-1beta/IL-18 processing. Uric acid \u2014 released from degradation of intracellular nucleic acids by xanthine oxidase; crystallizes as monosodium urate (MSU), activating NLRP3 inflammasome. Mitochondrial DNA \u2014 unmethylated CpG-rich (resembling bacterial DNA), activates TLR9 and cGAS-STING. Heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90) \u2014 activate TLR2 and TLR4 on APCs. (4) The resulting inflammatory response recruits neutrophils and macrophages, causes tissue damage, and can lead to sterile inflammation. REGULATED NECROSIS (pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis): Recently recognized forms of programmed necrotic cell death that combine the inflammatory consequences of necrosis with the regulated molecular mechanisms of apoptosis \u2014 for example, pyroptosis (gasdermin D pore formation, IL-1beta release) is critical for anti-microbial defense, while necroptosis (RIPK3-MLKL pathway, triggered when caspase-8/apoptosis is blocked) serves as a backup death mechanism.",

PHASE 1 \u2014 IMMEDIATE INNATE RESPONSE (0-6 hours): Resident macrophages and dendritic cells are the first responders, recognizing bacterial PAMPs via TLRs and other PRRs. They release pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) and chemokines (CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL1) that recruit neutrophils. Neutrophils appear within hours \u2014 they are the fastest-responding recruited immune cells, exiting blood via selectin-mediated rolling, integrin-mediated firm adhesion, and diapedesis through activated endothelium. Initial IFN-gamma (50 pg/mL) at 6 hours comes from NK cells and ILC1s (innate sources) rather than T cells. Bacteria are multiplying faster than they are being killed. PHASE 2 \u2014 INNATE CONTAINMENT AND APC BRIDGING (24-72 hours): Neutrophils peak at 24 hours (25,000/mL), providing maximum antimicrobial activity through phagocytosis, degranulation, ROS/RNS production, and NET formation. Macrophage numbers increase through monocyte recruitment and local proliferation. IFN-gamma rises, enhancing macrophage killing (M1 polarization). Bacterial burden peaks at 24 hours (10^6 CFU) then BEGINS to decline \u2014 innate immunity is containing but not clearing the infection. CRITICALLY, during this period: dendritic cells have captured antigen, undergone maturation, migrated via afferent lymphatics to draining lymph nodes (24-48 hours), and begun presenting antigen to naive T cells \u2014 initiating the adaptive response that will take days to manifest. PHASE 3 \u2014 ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE (Day 7-14): By day 7, the adaptive response becomes detectable: specific IgG appears (antigen-specific B cells have undergone clonal expansion, germinal center reactions, class switching, and plasma cell differentiation). Antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs appear (having undergone priming by DCs, clonal expansion over 5-7 days, acquiring approximately 15-20 cell divisions to generate thousands of effector CTLs from a single precursor). By day 14, adaptive immunity peaks: IgG at 500 AU/mL (opsonizing bacteria for enhanced phagocytosis and complement activation), CTLs at peak numbers (killing infected cells presenting bacterial peptides on MHC I). Bacterial clearance is essentially complete (10 CFU). PHASE 4 \u2014 RESOLUTION AND MEMORY (Day 28): The immune response contracts: approximately 90-95% of effector T cells undergo apoptosis (intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, Bim-dependent, due to cytokine withdrawal). Surviving cells become long-lived memory T cells (central memory in lymph nodes, effector memory in tissues). Long-lived plasma cells migrate to bone marrow, maintaining baseline antibody production. The infection is cleared, and the host is protected against reinfection by immunological memory \u2014 a secondary response would be faster (days instead of weeks), more vigorous, and IgG-dominated.",

      "explanation": "Preclinical evaluation of a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor requires systematic in vitro, in vivo efficacy, and safety assessment before clinical translation. IN VITRO CHARACTERIZATION: (1) Binding and blocking: Confirm the antibody binds the target checkpoint molecule with high affinity (surface plasmon resonance, Kd measurement), blocks the checkpoint-ligand interaction (competition ELISA), and does not cross-react with related molecules. (2) Functional enhancement: Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) \u2014 allogeneic stimulator cells + responder T cells + anti-checkpoint antibody should show enhanced T cell proliferation and cytokine production (IFN-gamma, IL-2) compared to isotype control. Tumor-T cell co-culture \u2014 mix tumor cells (expressing checkpoint ligand) with T cells + anti-checkpoint antibody; measure enhanced tumor cell killing (LDH release assay, flow cytometry-based killing assay), T cell activation (CD69, CD25, granzyme B expression), and cytokine production. (3) Dose-response and kinetics \u2014 establish optimal concentration range and treatment timing. IN VIVO EFFICACY: Syngeneic tumor models are essential because they have an intact immune system (unlike xenograft models in immunodeficient mice). Multiple models provide robustness: (1) MC38 colorectal carcinoma \u2014 moderately immunogenic, responds to checkpoint blockade. (2) B16-F10 melanoma \u2014 poorly immunogenic, resistant to monotherapy (good model for combination approaches). (3) CT26 colon carcinoma \u2014 immunogenic, good for studying TIL dynamics. Experimental groups: isotype control antibody, anti-checkpoint monotherapy (dose-response), anti-PD-1 monotherapy (benchmark), combination (anti-checkpoint + anti-PD-1). Endpoints: tumor growth curves (measured every 2-3 days), overall survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis), complete response rate. TIL ANALYSIS by flow cytometry: CD8+ T cell infiltration, activation state (granzyme B, IFN-gamma), exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3), Treg percentage, MDSC frequency, macrophage polarization (M1 vs M2). Abscopal effect: implant tumors bilaterally, treat only one tumor, assess whether systemic anti-tumor immunity affects the untreated distant tumor. SAFETY ASSESSMENT: Immune checkpoint inhibitors carry inherent risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) from breaking peripheral tolerance. Assess: organ histology (liver, lung, colon, thyroid, skin, kidney) for immune infiltrates and tissue damage; serum autoantibody panel (ANA, anti-thyroid, anti-tissue antibodies); serum cytokine levels; complete blood counts; liver and kidney function tests. The safety profile helps predict clinical irAE risk and guides monitoring strategies for clinical trials. COMBINATION STRATEGIES: Test rational combinations for synergy: with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (most common checkpoint combination), with anti-CTLA-4 (targets a different checkpoint pathway), with radiation (increases tumor immunogenicity via immunogenic cell death and neoantigen release), with chemotherapy (lymphodepletion-mediated homeostatic proliferation can enhance adoptive immunity).",

        "GVHD occurs when the recipient's immune system rejects the donor cells"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Graft-versus-host disease is a serious complication unique to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (and occasionally blood transfusions in immunocompromised patients) where immunocompetent donor T cells attack immunocompromised recipient tissues. GVHD was defined by Billingham's three criteria (1966): (1) The graft must contain immunocompetent cells (donor T cells). (2) The host must be immunoincompetent (unable to reject the donor cells \u2014 due to conditioning with chemotherapy/radiation). (3) The host must express tissue antigens not present in the donor. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY (three phases): PHASE 1 \u2014 TISSUE DAMAGE AND APC ACTIVATION: Pre-transplant conditioning (total body irradiation, high-dose chemotherapy) causes extensive tissue damage, particularly in the gut. This releases DAMPs (ATP, HMGB1, uric acid) and disrupts the intestinal barrier, allowing bacterial LPS translocation into the systemic circulation. DAMPs and PAMPs activate host APCs (dendritic cells, macrophages) to upregulate MHC, costimulatory molecules, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6). PHASE 2 \u2014 DONOR T CELL ACTIVATION: Donor T cells in the graft encounter activated host APCs presenting alloantigens \u2014 host MHC molecules (in MHC-mismatched transplants) and minor histocompatibility antigens (peptides derived from polymorphic host proteins presented on shared MHC molecules \u2014 important even in HLA-identical sibling transplants). The high precursor frequency of alloreactive T cells (1-10% of the T cell repertoire) ensures a vigorous response. Both CD4+ T cells (recognizing host MHC II) and CD8+ T cells (recognizing host MHC I) are activated, proliferate massively, and differentiate into effector cells. PHASE 3 \u2014 TARGET TISSUE DESTRUCTION: Effector mechanisms include: direct CTL killing of host epithelial cells (perforin/granzyme, FasL/Fas); cytokine-mediated damage (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma causing apoptosis and tissue necrosis); recruitment of additional inflammatory cells (macrophages, NK cells). Target organs reflect where donor T cells encounter host alloantigens on epithelial surfaces: SKIN (maculopapular rash, desquamation in severe cases), LIVER (biliary epithelium destruction, jaundice, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase), and GI TRACT (crypt cell apoptosis, diarrhea, potentially bloody). ACUTE vs CHRONIC GVHD: Acute GVHD (classically within 100 days, driven by Th1/Th17) targets skin, liver, gut. Chronic GVHD (after 100 days, Th2-driven, resembling autoimmune/fibrotic diseases) can affect virtually any organ with sclerotic/fibrotic changes (resembling scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, bronchiolitis obliterans). BENEFICIAL GRAFT-VERSUS-LEUKEMIA (GVL) EFFECT: Donor alloreactive T cells also attack residual leukemia cells (which express the same host alloantigens), providing an immunological anti-leukemia effect \u2014 the therapeutic goal is to separate GVL from GVHD.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were first described by Brinkmann et al. in 2004 as a novel antimicrobial mechanism. Upon activation by bacterial products (LPS, PMA), cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha), or activated platelets, neutrophils undergo a dramatic process: nuclear envelope disintegration, chromatin decondensation (losing the normal heterochromatin/euchromatin organization), mixing of chromatin with cytoplasmic granule proteins, and finally plasma membrane rupture to release the NET structure. NETs consist of a backbone of DNA fibers (primarily from nuclear DNA, though mitochondrial DNA can also contribute) studded with approximately 30 different antimicrobial proteins from azurophilic (primary) granules \u2014 neutrophil elastase (NE, a serine protease), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cathepsin G, proteinase 3 \u2014 and from specific (secondary) granules \u2014 lactoferrin, cathelicidins (LL-37), and alpha-defensins. Statement II is TRUE: PAD4-mediated histone citrullination is a critical step in NET formation. PAD4 converts arginine residues in histones (particularly H3 and H4) to citrulline, neutralizing the positive charge. Since histone-DNA interactions depend largely on electrostatic attraction between positively charged arginine/lysine residues and negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone, citrullination weakens these interactions dramatically, promoting chromatin decondensation. PAD4 knockout mice have severely impaired NET formation. Neutrophil elastase also contributes to chromatin decondensation by partially degrading histones in the nucleus. Statement III is TRUE: NETs serve as physical traps for pathogens \u2014 the DNA fibers create a mesh that immobilizes bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus), fungi (Candida albicans \u2014 NETs trap hyphae too large for phagocytosis), and even parasites. The embedded antimicrobial proteins then kill or damage trapped pathogens at high local concentrations. However, excessive or inappropriate NET formation has pathological consequences: THROMBOSIS \u2014 NETs provide a scaffold for platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition, activate the coagulation cascade (via tissue factor, factor XII activation), and contribute to deep vein thrombosis and stroke. AUTOIMMUNITY \u2014 citrullinated histones and DNA-protein complexes in NETs are potent autoantigens; anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in rheumatoid arthritis may target NET-derived citrullinated histones; NET-derived chromatin provides the dsDNA-histone autoantigen in SLE. SEPSIS \u2014 excessive NET formation causes endothelial damage and organ dysfunction (lung, liver, kidney). Statement IV is FALSE: NETosis is primarily a LYTIC (suicidal) process \u2014 the neutrophil dies as its nuclear and plasma membranes rupture to release the NET. However, a second, non-lytic ('vital') form of NETosis has been described where neutrophils release NETs from mitochondrial DNA while remaining viable and retaining phagocytic function. This vital NETosis is faster (minutes vs hours) but less well characterized than suicidal NETosis. The statement that NETs are EXCLUSIVELY formed through non-lytic processes is therefore false.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) is a critical cytosolic innate immune sensor discovered by Zhijian 'James' Chen's group in 2013. cGAS binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent, length-dependent manner \u2014 longer dsDNA (above approximately 45 bp) induces cGAS oligomerization along the DNA, creating a phase-separated liquid condensate that enhances enzymatic activity. Upon DNA binding, cGAS undergoes conformational change that activates its nucleotidyltransferase domain, catalyzing the synthesis of 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic [G(2',5')pA(3',5')p]) from GTP and ATP. This cyclic dinucleotide contains an unusual mixed 2'-5' and 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage that distinguishes it from bacterial cyclic dinucleotides (which have 3'-3' linkages). Statement II is TRUE: 2'3'-cGAMP functions as a second messenger that binds and activates STING (also called TMEM173/MITA/ERIS/MPYS), a transmembrane adaptor protein on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). cGAMP binding induces STING conformational change (rotation of the ligand-binding domain) and translocation from ER to ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi apparatus via COP-II vesicles. During trafficking, STING recruits TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) through its C-terminal tail. TBK1 phosphorylates STING (creating a docking site for IRF3 via its pLxIS motif), then phosphorylates IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and induces transcription of type I interferons (IFN-beta, IFN-alpha) and other ISGs (interferon-stimulated genes). STING also activates NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory gene expression. Statement III is TRUE: The cGAS-STING pathway functions as a universal cytosolic dsDNA surveillance system, detecting DNA from diverse sources: (1) Viral infection \u2014 DNA viruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, vaccinia) introduce their genomes into the cytoplasm during entry or replication. Even some RNA viruses (retroviruses like HIV \u2014 through reverse transcription intermediates) can activate cGAS. (2) Intracellular bacteria \u2014 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, Chlamydia trachomatis release DNA into the cytoplasm during vacuolar escape or destruction. (3) Mitochondrial DNA \u2014 mitochondrial stress, damage, or herniation releases mtDNA into the cytoplasm; mtDNA is a potent cGAS activator (contributing to sterile inflammation in cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and aging). (4) Micronuclei \u2014 chromosomal instability in cancer cells generates micronuclei (small nuclei containing chromosomal fragments outside the main nucleus); when micronuclear envelopes rupture, the exposed chromatin activates cGAS, driving tumor-intrinsic type I interferon production and anti-tumor immune responses. This represents a key link between genomic instability and cancer immunosurveillance. Statement IV is FALSE: cGAS does NOT discriminate between self and foreign DNA based on methylation or any sequence feature. cGAS binds dsDNA in a completely SEQUENCE-INDEPENDENT manner \u2014 it contacts the sugar-phosphate backbone, not the bases. The critical discrimination mechanism is LOCALIZATION: self-genomic DNA is normally confined to the nucleus (separated from cytosolic cGAS by the nuclear envelope) and mitochondria. To prevent self-activation, cells employ: TREX1 (Three prime Repair EXonuclease 1, also called DNase III) \u2014 a cytosolic exonuclease that degrades cytosolic DNA, preventing cGAS activation. TREX1 deficiency causes Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome \u2014 a severe autoinflammatory disease driven by constitutive cGAS-STING activation against accumulated self-DNA. DNase II \u2014 degrades DNA in lysosomes (from phagocytosed apoptotic cells). BAX/BAK-mediated apoptotic caspases also suppress cGAS activation during normal apoptosis.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Afferent lymphatic vessels drain interstitial fluid (lymph) from tissues and deliver it to lymph nodes. This lymph carries: soluble antigens (proteins, microbial products that drain freely), immune complexes, and critically, dendritic cells that have captured antigen in tissues and are migrating to the lymph node to present antigen to T cells. DCs migrate along afferent lymphatics guided by CCR7 expression responding to CCL21 in lymphatic endothelium. Lymph enters the subcapsular sinus, where subcapsular sinus macrophages can capture particulate antigens and transfer them to B cells. Efferent lymphatics exit the node at the hilum, carrying: activated effector T cells and B cells (that have completed their activation, proliferation, and differentiation within the node), antibodies produced by plasma cells, and recirculating naive lymphocytes that did not encounter their cognate antigen (exiting to continue their surveillance of other lymph nodes). Statement II is TRUE: High endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialized post-capillary venules found exclusively in lymph nodes (paracortex) and other secondary lymphoid organs (except spleen). Their cuboidal endothelial cells (unlike flat endothelium elsewhere) display: PNAd (peripheral node addressin), the ligand for L-selectin (CD62L) on naive T cells \u2014 mediating initial rolling. CCL21 and CCL19, presented on the luminal HEV surface bound to glycosaminoglycans, activate CCR7 on rolling lymphocytes \u2014 triggering inside-out signaling that activates LFA-1 (alphaL-beta2 integrin). Activated LFA-1 binds ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 on HEV endothelium \u2014 mediating firm arrest. The lymphocyte then transmigrates across the HEV into the lymph node parenchyma. Approximately 25 billion lymphocytes transit through lymph nodes daily via HEVs, ensuring that naive T cells (each carrying a unique TCR) continuously survey for their cognate antigen on dendritic cells. Statement III is TRUE: Lymph node organization is exquisitely structured to facilitate immune responses: CORTEX (outer): Contains primary B cell follicles (naive B cells organized around follicular dendritic cells) and secondary follicles (germinal centers during active immune responses). B cells are attracted by CXCL13 (produced by FDCs), which signals through CXCR5. PARACORTEX (inner cortex, T cell zone): Contains T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) and dendritic cells. T cells are attracted by CCL19 and CCL21 (produced by fibroblastic reticular cells), signaling through CCR7. DCs migrating from tissues via afferent lymphatics settle in the paracortex, maximizing contact with naive T cells. The T-B boundary (border between paracortex and follicle) is the critical site where activated CD4+ T cells interact with B cells that have captured and processed the same antigen \u2014 this cognate T-B interaction initiates the germinal center response. MEDULLA: Contains medullary cords (plasma cells, macrophages) and medullary sinuses (lymph collecting before exit via efferent lymphatics). Statement IV is FALSE: Lymph nodes are far from passive filters \u2014 they are highly organized and dynamic sites where adaptive immune responses are INITIATED and orchestrated. They actively concentrate antigens (via afferent lymph and subcapsular sinus macrophages), optimize DC-T cell encounters (FRC conduit network, organized T cell zone scanning), facilitate T-B cell interactions (T-B border), support germinal center reactions (FDC networks, Tfh cells), and release effector cells and antibodies into efferent lymph and ultimately the bloodstream.",

      "explanation": "These data provide a powerful illustration of antigen-driven clonal expansion and its role in celiac disease pathogenesis, while also demonstrating the contribution of environmental factors to autoimmune disease development. TCR REPERTOIRE ANALYSIS: The celiac twin's gut shows a dramatically restricted TCR repertoire \u2014 only 3,200 unique clonotypes compared to 15,000 in the healthy twin (approximately 5-fold reduction in diversity). The Shannon diversity index (which accounts for both richness and evenness) drops from 8.2 to 4.1, indicating not only fewer clonotypes but also extreme unevenness (domination by a few expanded clones). The 5 dominant clones (each 3-8% of the total repertoire) represent massive clonal expansions \u2014 in a normal polyclonal repertoire, no single clone should exceed approximately 0.5%. CONVERGENT TCR SELECTION: The observation that dominant clones share highly similar CDR3 sequences (the most variable loop of the TCR, primarily determining antigen specificity) indicates convergent or 'public' TCR usage. This occurs when a specific peptide-MHC combination (here, HLA-DQ2 presenting deamidated gliadin peptides) selects for TCRs with particular structural features in CDR3. In celiac disease, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) deamidates specific glutamine residues in gliadin peptides, converting them to negatively charged glutamate residues that anchor perfectly in the P4, P6, and P7 pockets of HLA-DQ2 (which prefer negative charges at these positions). The resulting DQ2-gliadin complexes are recognized by a restricted set of TCRs with conserved CDR3 motifs. TETRAMER DATA: HLA-DQ2:gliadin tetramer staining provides direct quantification of gluten-specific T cells. The celiac twin has 2.8% tetramer+ CD4+ T cells \u2014 a remarkable frequency for a single antigen specificity (typical pathogen-specific T cell frequencies during active infection are 1-5%). The healthy twin's 0.01% represents the baseline precursor frequency of gluten-reactive T cells in the naive repertoire \u2014 present due to random TCR generation but not activated or expanded. The 280-fold enrichment directly demonstrates active antigen-driven clonal expansion in celiac disease. TWIN DISCORDANCE: Despite identical HLA genetics (both carry HLA-DQ2, the primary genetic risk factor), only one twin developed celiac disease. This approximately 75% concordance rate in monozygotic twins (25% discordance) demonstrates that HLA-DQ2 is necessary but not sufficient \u2014 environmental factors modulate disease expression. These include: timing and amount of gluten introduction in infancy, gastrointestinal infections (rotavirus may increase risk by damaging intestinal barrier and promoting inflammatory DC activation), gut microbiome composition (dysbiosis may break oral tolerance to gluten), breast-feeding duration, and potentially other environmental triggers that convert tolerance to immunogenic response against dietary gluten.",

Transfusion with D-positive blood would trigger an accelerated hemolytic transfusion reaction (anamnestic IgG anti-D response causing extravascular hemolysis in the spleen via FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis). Compatible blood: A-negative (ABO and Rh matched) or O-negative (universal donor RBCs). (2) PREGNANCY: If this is a woman of childbearing age, anti-D antibodies pose a serious risk for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in future pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses. Maternal IgG anti-D crosses the placenta, binds fetal Rh-positive RBCs, and causes their destruction (erythrocyte opsonization and splenic phagocytosis), leading to fetal anemia, hydrops fetalis (in severe cases), and neonatal jaundice/kernicterus. Anti-D titer monitoring during pregnancy guides clinical management. This patient has already been sensitized, so RhIG (Rh immune globulin/anti-D prophylaxis) would be ineffective at preventing further immunization \u2014 but titer monitoring and potential intrauterine transfusion may be needed in pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "MHC class I and class II molecules are structurally and functionally distinct, creating two complementary antigen presentation pathways. MHC CLASS I: STRUCTURE: Heterodimer of a polymorphic alpha chain (heavy chain, approximately 45 kDa) with three extracellular domains (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3) and beta-2-microglobulin (light chain, approximately 12 kDa, non-polymorphic, non-covalently associated). The peptide-binding groove is formed by alpha1 and alpha2 domains \u2014 it is CLOSED at both ends, constraining peptide length to 8-10 amino acids (typically 9). EXPRESSION: Expressed on virtually ALL nucleated cells (not on mature red blood cells or trophoblasts). Expression levels vary (highest on DCs, lowest on neurons and hepatocytes). IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha upregulate MHC I expression. Three classical (Ia) genes in humans: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C. PEPTIDE SOURCE: Endogenous pathway \u2014 proteins synthesized within the cell (including viral proteins, tumor antigens, normal self-proteins) are degraded by the proteasome/immunoproteasome in the cytosol, transported into the ER by TAP, trimmed by ERAAP, and loaded onto MHC I by the peptide-loading complex (tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57). This ensures MHC I displays a sampling of the cell's internal protein content. T CELL RECOGNITION: CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize peptide-MHC I complexes. The CD8 co-receptor binds the alpha3 domain of MHC I. If the displayed peptide is foreign (viral, tumor), the CTL kills the presenting cell. MHC CLASS II: STRUCTURE: Heterodimer of alpha chain (approximately 34 kDa, alpha1 and alpha2 domains) and beta chain (approximately 29 kDa, beta1 and beta2 domains). Both chains are transmembrane. The peptide-binding groove is formed by alpha1 and beta1 \u2014 it is OPEN at both ends, allowing longer peptides (13-25 amino acids, typically 15-20) with peptide overhangs extending beyond the groove. Three classical genes in humans: HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ. EXPRESSION: Constitutively expressed on professional APCs: dendritic cells (highest levels), macrophages, and B cells. Can be induced on other cell types by IFN-gamma (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts). PEPTIDE SOURCE: Exogenous pathway \u2014 extracellular proteins are internalized by endocytosis/phagocytosis, degraded by acidic proteases (cathepsins) in endolysosomes, and loaded onto MHC II. In the ER, newly synthesized MHC II alpha-beta dimers associate with invariant chain (Ii, CD74), which: blocks the peptide-binding groove (preventing premature loading of ER-resident peptides), targets MHC II to the endosomal pathway (via sorting signals). In late endosomes (MIIC compartment), Ii is progressively degraded by cathepsins, leaving a residual fragment CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide) in the groove. HLA-DM (a non-classical MHC II molecule) catalyzes CLIP removal and facilitates loading of high-affinity antigenic peptides. T CELL RECOGNITION: CD4+ helper T cells recognize peptide-MHC II complexes. The CD4 co-receptor binds the beta2 domain of MHC II. FUNCTIONAL LOGIC: This division of labor ensures: (1) ALL cells are monitored for intracellular pathogens by CD8+ CTLs via MHC I \u2014 any infected or transformed cell can be detected and killed. (2) CD4+ T cell help is restricted to professional APCs via MHC II \u2014 preventing inappropriate T cell activation by non-professional cells that lack costimulatory molecules.",

        "Trained immunity only occurs in T cells and requires the thymus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Trained immunity (also called innate immune memory) is a paradigm-shifting concept that challenges the traditional dichotomy between innate (non-adaptive) and adaptive (memory-forming) immunity. First rigorously described by Mihai Netea's group, it demonstrates that innate immune cells can exhibit enhanced responsiveness upon re-stimulation. KEY FEATURES DISTINGUISHING FROM ADAPTIVE MEMORY: (1) NON-SPECIFIC: Trained innate cells show enhanced responses to a broad range of stimuli, not just the original stimulus. For example, monocytes trained with beta-glucan (a fungal PAMP) show enhanced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta production when subsequently stimulated with unrelated stimuli (LPS, bacterial peptidoglycan, Pam3Cys). This contrasts with antigen-specific memory T/B cells. (2) NO CLONAL EXPANSION: Trained immunity does not involve clonal selection or expansion of antigen-specific cells. It enhances the functional capacity of the existing innate cell population. (3) SHORTER DURATION: Trained immunity lasts months to perhaps years (limited by monocyte/macrophage lifespan and epigenetic stability), whereas adaptive memory can last decades (through self-renewing memory T/B cells and long-lived plasma cells). However, training of bone marrow progenitors can extend its duration. MOLECULAR MECHANISMS: (1) EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING: The core mechanism. Initial PAMP exposure causes lasting changes in chromatin accessibility at genes encoding inflammatory mediators. Key modifications: H3K4me1 (monomethylation \u2014 marks enhancers for future activation, 'poised' state), H3K4me3 (trimethylation \u2014 activating mark at promoters), H3K27ac (acetylation \u2014 active enhancer mark), with concurrent loss of repressive H3K9me3 marks. These modifications persist after the initial stimulus is removed, creating a 'primed' chromatin state that allows faster and stronger gene transcription upon re-stimulation. The histone methyltransferase Set7 is critical for establishing H3K4me1 marks in trained monocytes. (2) METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING: Trained monocytes undergo a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), mediated by: mTOR activation (upstream of HIF-1alpha), HIF-1alpha-dependent upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase), increased fumarate accumulation (TCA cycle intermediate) that inhibits KDM5 histone demethylases, stabilizing H3K4me3 marks \u2014 linking metabolism to epigenetics, cholesterol synthesis pathway activation (mevalonate pathway provides substrates for protein prenylation and epigenetic modifications). (3) INDUCERS: BCG vaccine (Mycobacterium bovis), beta-glucan (Candida albicans cell wall component), oxidized LDL (relevant to atherosclerosis), and muramyl dipeptide (MDP, from bacterial peptidoglycan) all induce trained immunity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against neonatal mortality from infections other than tuberculosis (approximately 30-50% reduction in all-cause mortality in randomized trials in developing countries). BCG-trained monocytes show enhanced cytokine production against Candida, Staphylococcus, and influenza. Clinical trials are exploring BCG revaccination and beta-glucan for broadly enhanced infection resistance.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a retrovirus with a specific tropism for CD4+ cells, and its pathogenesis illustrates the central role of CD4+ T helper cells in orchestrating immune responses. VIRAL ENTRY MECHANISM: HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 (trimeric spike) first binds CD4 on the target cell surface with high affinity (Kd approximately 4 nM). CD4 binding induces conformational change in gp120, exposing the coreceptor-binding site (V3 loop and bridging sheet). gp120 then engages a coreceptor: CCR5 (chemokine receptor for CCL3/CCL5/CCL4) \u2014 used by R5-tropic strains that predominate during early infection, targeting macrophages, dendritic cells, and CCR5+ memory CD4+ T cells. The CCR5-delta32 homozygous deletion (approximately 1% of Europeans) provides near-complete resistance to HIV infection \u2014 the basis for the 'Berlin patient' cure (Timothy Ray Brown, treated with CCR5-delta32 homozygous bone marrow transplant). CXCR4 (chemokine receptor for CXCL12) \u2014 used by X4-tropic strains that emerge later, targeting naive CD4+ T cells and causing more rapid CD4 decline. Coreceptor binding triggers conformational change in gp41 (transmembrane envelope protein), exposing the fusion peptide that inserts into the target cell membrane. gp41 then folds into a six-helix bundle, pulling viral and cell membranes together for fusion (the target of enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor). CD4+ T CELL DEPLETION MECHANISMS: (1) DIRECT VIRAL KILLING: Productive infection causes cell death through viral budding-induced membrane damage, accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA (activating DNA damage responses), and viral protein toxicity (Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest, Env-induced syncytia formation). (2) CHRONIC IMMUNE ACTIVATION: The most significant mechanism. Chronic HIV replication causes persistent immune activation \u2014 CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and ADCC target infected CD4+ cells; inflammatory cytokines drive activation-induced cell death (AICD) of bystander T cells; microbial translocation through damaged gut mucosa (massive CD4+ depletion in gut-associated lymphoid tissue occurs early, disrupting epithelial barrier) provides continuous TLR stimulation. (3) PYROPTOSIS: The majority (approximately 95%) of CD4+ T cell death in lymphoid tissues is caused by abortive infection of resting CD4+ T cells \u2014 incomplete reverse transcripts are detected by the cytosolic DNA sensor IFI16, activating caspase-1 inflammasome and causing pyroptotic cell death with inflammatory cytokine release (IL-1beta, IL-18), creating a vicious cycle of inflammation and cell death. CONSEQUENCES OF CD4+ DEPLETION: CD4+ T cells are the 'conductors of the immune orchestra' \u2014 they provide essential help for: CD8+ CTL priming and memory (via licensed DCs), B cell activation and germinal center responses (via Tfh cells), macrophage activation (via IFN-gamma from Th1), neutrophil recruitment (via IL-17 from Th17). When CD4+ counts fall below 200/microL (AIDS definition), the entire adaptive immune system collapses, leading to susceptibility to opportunistic infections that healthy immune systems normally control: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, most common AIDS-defining illness), cerebral toxoplasmosis, CMV retinitis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), esophageal/pulmonary candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, and AIDS-defining malignancies driven by oncogenic viruses no longer controlled by immune surveillance (Kaposi's sarcoma \u2014 HHV-8, non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2014 EBV, cervical cancer \u2014 HPV).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Current seasonal influenza vaccines target the highly variable HA head domain (which contains the receptor binding site and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies), requiring annual reformulation due to antigenic drift (point mutations in HA head epitopes). A universal influenza vaccine must target conserved epitopes that are shared across diverse influenza subtypes. HEMAGGLUTININ STALK STRATEGY: The HA stalk (stem) domain is structurally conserved across influenza subtypes because it mediates the critical membrane fusion function \u2014 mutations that dramatically alter stalk structure impair viral entry. Anti-stalk antibodies, while generally lower in neutralizing potency than anti-head antibodies, provide BROADLY REACTIVE protection through: (1) direct neutralization (blocking the conformational change required for membrane fusion at low pH in endosomes), (2) Fc-mediated effector functions (ADCC by NK cells, complement activation, phagocytosis \u2014 anti-stalk antibodies are particularly effective at ADCC because the stalk is accessible on virus-infected cell surfaces). CHIMERIC HA IMMUNOGENS: The key challenge is immunodominance \u2014 the HA head domain normally dominates the antibody response, suppressing stalk-directed responses. Chimeric HA constructs (e.g., H6 head on H1 stalk for priming, then H5 head on H1 stalk for boosting) present the same stalk epitopes but different head epitopes in each immunization. This prevents boosting of head-directed responses (different heads each time) while selectively boosting stalk-directed responses (same stalk each time). EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION: (1) Breadth of antibody response: serum neutralization assays against multiple subtypes (group 1: H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9; group 2: H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15) \u2014 a truly universal vaccine should cross-react across both groups. (2) ADCC assays: co-culture of HA-expressing target cells with NK cells + immune serum, measuring target cell lysis \u2014 critical because ADCC may be more important than direct neutralization for stalk antibodies. (3) Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) against heterologous strains to assess cross-reactivity. (4) T cell responses: conserved internal proteins (nucleoprotein/NP, matrix protein/M1, polymerase PB1) provide cross-reactive CD8+ T cell epitopes \u2014 these T cells kill virus-infected cells and reduce disease severity even without preventing infection. (5) Ferret challenge: ferrets are the gold standard animal model for influenza (they develop human-like disease with fever, nasal congestion, sneezing). Vaccinate ferrets, then challenge with mismatched influenza strains \u2014 measure viral shedding (nasal washes, quantitative RT-PCR), disease severity (weight loss, fever, activity), and survival.",

      "question": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system. TLR4 specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria. What downstream signaling pathway does TLR4 activation trigger?",
      "options": [
        "TLR4 activates the JAK-STAT pathway, directly phosphorylating STAT3 to induce interferon production",
        "TLR4 signals through MyD88 adaptor protein, activating NF-kB transcription factor, which translocates to the nucleus and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6",

        "TLR4 signals through the Notch pathway, inducing differentiation of naive T cells into effector cells"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "TLR4 is the primary receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. When LPS binds TLR4 (in complex with MD-2 and CD14), TLR4 dimerizes and recruits intracellular adaptor proteins, primarily MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88). MyD88 activates IRAK kinases (IL-1 receptor-associated kinases), which activate TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6). TRAF6 then activates the IKK complex (IkB kinase), which phosphorylates IkB, the inhibitor of NF-kB. Phosphorylated IkB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, releasing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus. NF-kB is a master transcription factor that upregulates hundreds of pro-inflammatory genes including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. TLR4 also has a MyD88-independent pathway through TRIF adaptor, which leads to IRF3 activation and type I interferon production. Option A describes a different pathway. Option C confuses TLR signaling with inflammasome activation. Option D involves adaptive immunity signaling.",

      "question": "MHC class I molecules present endogenous (intracellular) peptide antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. What is the source of these peptides and how are they loaded onto MHC I?",
      "options": [
        "Extracellular proteins are endocytosed, digested in lysosomes, and loaded onto MHC I in endosomes",
        "Intracellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome into peptides, transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing), and loaded onto MHC I molecules before transport to the cell surface",

        "MHC I molecules synthesize their own peptide antigens using ribosomal machinery within the ER"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway is critical for immune surveillance of intracellular infections and tumors. The process begins when intracellular proteins (including viral proteins, mutated self-proteins, and normal self-proteins for tolerance) are tagged with ubiquitin and degraded by the proteasome (specifically the immunoproteasome during infection, which has modified catalytic subunits induced by interferon-gamma). The resulting peptide fragments (typically 8-10 amino acids) are transported from the cytosol into the ER lumen by TAP (Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing), a heterodimeric ABC transporter composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. In the ER, peptides are loaded onto MHC I molecules (which consist of a polymorphic heavy chain and beta-2 microglobulin) with the help of a peptide-loading complex including tapasin, ERp57, and calreticulin. Only peptides that fit the binding groove and stabilize the MHC I-peptide complex are retained. The stable complex then transits through the Golgi to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells. Option A describes the MHC class II pathway. Options C and D describe non-existent mechanisms.",

      "question": "Clonal selection theory explains how the adaptive immune system generates specific responses. What happens when a naive B cell encounters its cognate antigen for the first time?",
      "options": [
        "The B cell immediately begins producing high-affinity IgG antibodies that neutralize the pathogen within minutes",
        "The B cell undergoes apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity, and a new B cell with the same receptor is generated from stem cells",
        "The B cell is activated, proliferates to form a clone of identical cells, and differentiates into antibody-secreting plasma cells (initially producing IgM) and long-lived memory B cells",
        "The B cell transfers its antigen receptor gene to neighboring T cells, enabling them to directly recognize the pathogen"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Clonal selection, first proposed by Burnet in 1957, is the fundamental mechanism of adaptive immunity. Each naive B cell expresses a unique B cell receptor (BCR, membrane-bound immunoglobulin) generated through V(D)J recombination during B cell development in the bone marrow. When a naive B cell encounters an antigen that specifically binds its BCR (with help from T follicular helper cells for most antigens), it becomes activated. The activated B cell then undergoes rapid clonal expansion — dividing multiple times to generate a large clone of cells with identical antigen specificity. Some of these clonal daughters differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts and then plasma cells, which secrete large quantities of antibody (initially IgM, the first class produced). Other daughter cells enter germinal centers where they undergo somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (changing to IgG, IgA, or IgE), followed by affinity maturation through selection for higher-affinity variants. Some cells become long-lived memory B cells that persist for decades and can mount rapid secondary responses. Option A is wrong — initial response takes 5-7 days and produces IgM first. Option B describes negative selection. Option D fabricates a mechanism.",

      "question": "V(D)J recombination generates the enormous diversity of antigen receptors on B and T lymphocytes. The RAG1/RAG2 recombinase complex mediates this process. Approximately how many different antibody specificities can be generated, and what are the main mechanisms contributing to this diversity?",
      "options": [
        "Approximately 1,000 specificities, generated solely by having 1,000 different germline V gene segments",
        "Approximately 10^11 or more specificities, generated through combinatorial joining of V, D, and J gene segments, junctional diversity (P and N nucleotide addition), and combinatorial pairing of heavy and light chains",
        "Approximately 10^4 specificities, generated by random point mutations in a single antibody gene",
        "Approximately 10^6 specificities, generated exclusively by somatic hypermutation in germinal centers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The adaptive immune system generates an extraordinary diversity of antigen receptors through multiple mechanisms acting at different stages. (1) Combinatorial diversity — the heavy chain locus has approximately 40 functional V segments, 25 D segments, and 6 J segments. Random joining gives 40 x 25 x 6 = 6,000 combinations for heavy chain alone. Light chain (kappa or lambda) adds another approximately 200 combinations. (2) Junctional diversity — during V(D)J recombination, the RAG complex creates imprecise joins. P nucleotides are added when hairpin intermediates are asymmetrically opened by Artemis nuclease. N nucleotides are added randomly by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme that adds nucleotides without a template. These junctional additions/deletions at the V-D, D-J, and V-J boundaries create enormous diversity at the CDR3 region (the most variable part of the antigen-binding site). (3) Combinatorial pairing of heavy and light chains multiplies diversity further. Together, these mechanisms generate a theoretical diversity exceeding 10^11 unique specificities from a genome with fewer than 400 gene segments. Somatic hypermutation (option D) occurs later, during the immune response, and further diversifies already-rearranged antibodies in germinal centers.",

      "question": "The complement system consists of over 30 plasma proteins that form a proteolytic cascade. The classical pathway is activated by antibody-antigen complexes. Which complement component forms the membrane attack complex (MAC), and what is its mechanism of action?",
      "options": [
        "C3b molecules aggregate on the pathogen surface, forming a physical barrier that blocks nutrient uptake",
        "C1q directly inserts into the bacterial membrane, creating pores",
        "C5b initiates MAC assembly by recruiting C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules, which polymerize to form a transmembrane pore approximately 10 nm in diameter that disrupts osmotic balance, causing cell lysis",
        "C4b binds to bacterial flagella, immobilizing the pathogen and preventing tissue invasion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The membrane attack complex (MAC) is the terminal effector of the complement cascade. After complement activation (through classical, lectin, or alternative pathways) generates C5 convertase, C5 is cleaved into C5a (a potent anaphylatoxin and chemotactic factor) and C5b. C5b initiates MAC assembly on the target membrane through a sequential, non-enzymatic process: C5b binds C6, then C7, forming C5b67 which inserts into the lipid bilayer. C8 then binds and partially penetrates the membrane, creating a small pore. Finally, C9 molecules are recruited and polymerize (10-16 C9 molecules) to form the complete ring-shaped transmembrane channel (poly-C9), approximately 10 nm in inner diameter. This pore is large enough to allow free passage of water, ions, and small molecules, disrupting the osmotic barrier and causing influx of water and calcium ions. In nucleated cells, this can trigger apoptosis or activate repair mechanisms, while in bacteria and red blood cells, it causes direct osmotic lysis. Gram-negative bacteria are particularly susceptible because the MAC can breach their outer membrane, while gram-positive bacteria are relatively resistant due to their thick peptidoglycan layer. Option A describes opsonization. Option B misidentifies the pore-forming component. Option D fabricates a mechanism.",

      "question": "Helper T cells (CD4+) differentiate into distinct subsets depending on the cytokine environment during activation. Th1 cells promote cell-mediated immunity, while Th2 cells promote humoral immunity. Which cytokines drive Th1 versus Th2 differentiation?",
      "options": [
        "IL-10 drives Th1 differentiation; IFN-gamma drives Th2 differentiation",

        "IL-2 drives Th1 differentiation; IL-6 drives Th2 differentiation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "CD4+ T helper cell differentiation is directed by the cytokine milieu present during T cell activation. For Th1 differentiation: IL-12 (produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to intracellular pathogens) and IFN-gamma (from NK cells early in infection) activate STAT4 and STAT1 respectively, which induce the master transcription factor T-bet. T-bet drives expression of IFN-gamma (the signature Th1 cytokine), creating a positive feedback loop, and suppresses Th2 development. Th1 cells activate macrophages and promote cytotoxic responses against intracellular pathogens. For Th2 differentiation: IL-4 (initial source debated — possibly basophils, NKT cells, or T cells themselves) activates STAT6, inducing the master transcription factor GATA-3. GATA-3 drives expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, promoting B cell class switching to IgE, eosinophil activation, and mucus production. Th2 responses target helminths and are responsible for allergic diseases. This Th1/Th2 paradigm has expanded to include Th17 (driven by IL-6 + TGF-beta, master TF ROR-gamma-t), Treg (TGF-beta alone, master TF Foxp3), and Tfh subsets. Option A reverses the cytokines.

      "question": "Immunological memory is the basis of vaccination. After a primary immune response, a secondary exposure to the same antigen produces a faster, stronger, and qualitatively different response. What accounts for the enhanced secondary response?",
      "options": [
        "The pathogen evolves to become weaker upon re-exposure, making it easier to clear",
        "Memory B cells have already undergone class switching and somatic hypermutation, producing higher-affinity IgG rapidly; memory T cells have lower activation thresholds and respond faster; both populations are present in greater numbers than naive precursors",
        "The innate immune system 'remembers' the pathogen through permanent changes in macrophage gene expression",
        "More antigen-presenting cells are available during secondary infection because they were not destroyed during the primary response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The secondary (anamnestic) immune response differs from the primary response in four key ways, all attributable to immunological memory. (1) Speed — memory cells respond within 1-3 days versus 5-10 days for naive cells. Memory B cells have lower activation thresholds and can present antigen more efficiently because they express higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC II. Memory T cells are positioned at tissue sites (tissue-resident memory T cells) rather than confined to lymph nodes. (2) Magnitude — memory cell precursor frequency is 100-1000x higher than naive precursor frequency for a given antigen. Memory cells proliferate more vigorously upon restimulation. (3) Affinity — memory B cells have already undergone somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in germinal centers, so they produce higher-affinity antibodies immediately upon restimulation. (4) Antibody class — memory B cells have already undergone class switch recombination, so the secondary response is dominated by IgG (or IgA at mucosal sites) rather than IgM. Memory T cells have epigenetic modifications that allow faster expression of effector cytokines. Together, these quantitative and qualitative improvements make the secondary response dramatically more effective.",

      "options": [
        "AIRE is a kinase that phosphorylates self-reactive TCRs, marking them for degradation",
        "AIRE promotes ectopic expression of tissue-specific antigens (such as insulin, thyroglobulin, and myelin proteins) in thymic medullary epithelial cells, allowing developing T cells to be tested against a comprehensive array of self-antigens",
        "AIRE blocks the production of self-reactive antibodies by B cells in the bone marrow",
        "AIRE activates regulatory T cells that suppress all immune responses in the thymus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "AIRE (Autoimmune Regulator) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Its remarkable function is to drive 'promiscuous gene expression' — the ectopic transcription of thousands of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) that are normally expressed only in specific peripheral tissues. For example, mTECs expressing AIRE produce insulin (normally pancreas-specific), thyroglobulin (thyroid-specific), myelin basic protein (nervous system-specific), and hundreds of other tissue-specific proteins. These proteins are processed and presented on MHC molecules on the mTEC surface. Developing T cells that strongly recognize these self-peptide-MHC complexes are eliminated by apoptosis (negative selection), preventing them from escaping to the periphery and attacking self-tissues. AIRE mutations in humans cause APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy), a devastating autoimmune syndrome affecting multiple organs — demonstrating that without AIRE, self-reactive T cells escape thymic selection and attack the tissues whose antigens were not presented during development. AIRE achieves its transcriptional effects partly through interaction with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and DNA damage response machinery. Option A fabricates a mechanism. Option C confuses T and B cell tolerance. Option D oversimplifies Treg biology.",

        "Complement component C5a is the sole trigger for mast cell activation in allergic reactions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Type I hypersensitivity is a two-phase process. In the sensitization phase, initial allergen exposure drives Th2 responses and IgE class switching in B cells. Secreted IgE binds with extremely high affinity (Ka approximately 10^10 M^-1) to Fc-epsilon-RI receptors on mast cell and basophil surfaces, where it persists for weeks. In the effector phase (re-exposure), multivalent allergen crosslinks adjacent IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. This crosslinking aggregates Fc-epsilon-RI receptors, activating intracellular signaling cascades involving Lyn and Syk kinases, PLCgamma, and calcium mobilization. The result is rapid degranulation (within seconds to minutes), releasing preformed granule mediators: histamine (causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, itching), heparin (anticoagulant), tryptase and chymase (proteases), and TNF-alpha. The late phase (hours later) involves de novo synthesis of lipid mediators: prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4/D4/E4 (previously called slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis — 1000x more potent bronchoconstrictors than histamine), and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) that recruit eosinophils and sustain inflammation.

        "NK cells detect heat produced by metabolically active tumor cells using thermoreceptors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "NK cell target recognition is governed by the 'missing self' and 'induced self' hypotheses, mediated through a balance of activating and inhibitory receptor signals. Inhibitory receptors — including killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in humans and Ly49 receptors in mice — recognize MHC class I molecules on target cells. Since all healthy nucleated cells express MHC I, this generates a dominant inhibitory signal that prevents NK cell activation. Many viruses and tumors downregulate MHC I to evade CD8+ T cell recognition, but this removes the inhibitory signal from NK cells ('missing self'), tipping the balance toward activation. Simultaneously, activating receptors — including NKG2D, natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, NKp46), and DNAM-1 — recognize stress-induced ligands that are upregulated on infected, transformed, or stressed cells. NKG2D recognizes MICA, MICB, and ULBPs — molecules induced by DNA damage, viral infection, or cellular transformation ('induced self'). When activating signals exceed inhibitory signals, the NK cell degranulates, releasing perforin and granzymes. NK cells also mediate ADCC (option C) through the FcgammaRIII (CD16) receptor, but this is not their sole mechanism.",

        "Class switching occurs through transfection of new constant region genes from T helper cells to B cells via exosomes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Class switch recombination (CSR) is an irreversible DNA recombination event that occurs in activated B cells, typically in germinal centers. The mechanism involves: (1) Cytokine signals from T helper cells determine which constant region gene segment will be targeted — IFN-gamma directs switching to IgG1/IgG3, IL-4 to IgG4/IgE, TGF-beta to IgA. These cytokines induce germline transcription through specific switch (S) regions, opening the chromatin. (2) Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme also responsible for somatic hypermutation, deaminates cytosine residues to uracil in the S regions of both the donor (Smu) and target constant region genes. (3) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) removes the uracils, creating abasic sites. Mismatch repair and base excision repair enzymes then convert these into single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks. (4) The region between the two S regions (including the intervening constant region genes) is looped out and deleted. (5) The break ends are joined by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), placing the rearranged VDJ segment upstream of the new constant region. Critically, the variable region (and thus antigen specificity) is preserved. AID deficiency causes Hyper-IgM syndrome type 2.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the immune system, uniquely positioned to connect innate detection of pathogens to adaptive immune activation. Their lifecycle involves two phases: (1) Immature DCs reside in peripheral tissues (skin Langerhans cells, mucosal DCs, interstitial DCs) where they are specialized for antigen capture through macropinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis (via C-type lectin receptors, scavenger receptors), and phagocytosis. They express high levels of pattern recognition receptors (TLRs, NOD-like receptors, RIG-I) but low levels of MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules. (2) Upon pathogen detection, DCs undergo maturation — a dramatic phenotypic transformation. They upregulate CCR7 (chemokine receptor for CCL19/CCL21), enabling migration to T cell zones of draining lymph nodes. During migration, they process captured antigens, upregulate MHC I and MHC II surface expression (10-100 fold increase), and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Mature DCs present antigen-MHC complexes to naive T cells that continuously recirculate through lymph nodes, providing the three signals required for T cell activation: Signal 1 (antigen-MHC/TCR), Signal 2 (co-stimulation), and Signal 3 (polarizing cytokines). No other cell type performs this sentinel-to-activator transition as efficiently.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "CD8+ CTLs use two distinct but complementary killing mechanisms, both inducing apoptosis (not necrosis) in target cells — this is important because apoptosis is immunologically 'clean' and does not release inflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns. Pathway 1 — Perforin/Granzyme: Upon TCR recognition of peptide-MHC I on a target cell, the CTL polarizes its secretory machinery toward the immunological synapse. Lytic granules containing perforin and granzymes are released by directed exocytosis. Perforin (homologous to complement C9) polymerizes in the target cell membrane, forming pores approximately 16 nm in diameter. Granzymes (serine proteases, particularly granzyme B) enter through these pores and directly cleave and activate initiator caspase-8 and effector caspase-3, as well as the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, triggering the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Pathway 2 — Fas/FasL: CTLs express Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L) on their surface. Binding to Fas (CD95) on target cells triggers trimerization of Fas, recruitment of FADD adaptor protein and caspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which activates the caspase cascade. The perforin/granzyme pathway is the dominant mechanism for clearing viral infections and tumors, while the Fas/FasL pathway is important for immune regulation and lymphocyte homeostasis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "HIV entry is a multi-step process requiring sequential receptor interactions. First, the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds with high affinity to the CD4 molecule on the target cell surface. This binding induces a conformational change in gp120 that exposes the co-receptor binding site. gp120 then binds to a chemokine co-receptor — either CCR5 (used by macrophage-tropic strains, predominant in early infection) or CXCR4 (used by T cell-tropic strains, emerging in late disease). This second binding triggers a conformational change in gp41 (the transmembrane envelope protein), exposing its hydrophobic fusion peptide, which inserts into the host cell membrane. gp41 then folds into a hairpin structure, pulling the viral and cellular membranes together until they fuse, releasing the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. The CCR5-delta32 mutation (a 32-base-pair deletion rendering CCR5 non-functional) confers resistance to HIV infection — this was the basis for the 'Berlin patient' cure. CD4+ T cell depletion is catastrophic because these cells are the central coordinators of adaptive immunity: they provide help to B cells (class switching, germinal center reactions), to CD8+ T cells (initial priming and memory maintenance), and to macrophages (IFN-gamma activation). Without CD4 help, the entire adaptive immune system eventually collapses, leading to opportunistic infections and malignancies that define AIDS.",

Phase 1 (seconds to minutes) — Sentinel cells: Tissue-resident mast cells detect injury through DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns like ATP, HMGB1) and PAMPs through TLRs. They degranulate, releasing histamine, TNF-alpha, and proteases. Resident macrophages phagocytose pathogens and release pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8/CXCL8). Phase 2 (minutes) — Vascular changes: Histamine and prostaglandins cause arteriolar vasodilation (increased blood flow = redness and heat). TNF-alpha and histamine cause endothelial cell contraction in postcapillary venules, creating intercellular gaps that increase vascular permeability, allowing plasma proteins (complement, antibodies, clotting factors) and fluid to leak into tissues (edema = swelling). Phase 3 (minutes to hours) — Leukocyte recruitment: Activated endothelial cells upregulate adhesion molecules (selectins for rolling, ICAM-1/VCAM-1 for firm adhesion). Neutrophils roll on selectins, activate integrins, firmly adhere, and undergo transendothelial migration (diapedesis). They follow chemokine gradients (IL-8, C5a, fMLP) to the infection site. Neutrophils are the first leukocytes recruited (within 1-2 hours), followed by monocytes (hours to days).",

      "explanation": "Type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) are the frontline antiviral cytokines. When a cell is infected by a virus, cytoplasmic sensors (RIG-I and MDA5 for RNA viruses, cGAS-STING for DNA viruses) detect viral nucleic acids and activate transcription factors IRF3/IRF7, which drive IFN-alpha/beta production. These interferons are secreted and bind to the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1/IFNAR2) on neighboring uninfected cells in a paracrine manner (and on the producing cell in an autocrine manner). IFNAR activation triggers the JAK-STAT signaling cascade: JAK1 and TYK2 kinases phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, which form a heterodimer that combines with IRF9 to create the ISGF3 complex. ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and binds ISRE (interferon-stimulated response elements), inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Key ISG products include: PKR (protein kinase R) — phosphorylates eIF2-alpha, shutting down all protein synthesis; OAS (2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase) — activates RNase L, which degrades all RNA; Mx proteins — GTPases that block viral replication; ADAR — RNA editing enzyme; viperin — inhibits lipid raft formation needed for viral budding.

This pentameric structure provides 10 antigen-binding sites, giving IgM extraordinarily high avidity for multivalent antigens despite relatively low individual binding affinity. IgM is the most efficient immunoglobulin at activating complement (only one IgM pentamer is needed, versus two IgG molecules). Statement II is TRUE: IgA is the predominant antibody class at mucosal surfaces, constituting approximately 70% of total immunoglobulin production in the body. Secretory IgA (sIgA) is a dimer linked by a J chain with an additional secretory component (derived from the poly-Ig receptor during transcytosis across epithelial cells). sIgA provides 'immune exclusion' by binding pathogens and toxins at mucosal surfaces. Breast milk IgA is critical for neonatal mucosal immunity. Statement III is FALSE: IgE is present at the LOWEST serum concentration of all immunoglobulin classes (approximately 0.05 mg/dL versus approximately 1,200 mg/dL for IgG). IgE is involved in allergic responses and anti-helminth immunity, not opsonization. Statement IV is TRUE: IgG comprises approximately 75-80% of serum immunoglobulin.

Foxp3 mutations cause IPEX syndrome (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked), a lethal multi-organ autoimmune disease demonstrating the critical role of Tregs.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) produces US2, US3, US6, and US11, which interfere with MHC I at multiple steps — redirecting it for proteasomal degradation, retaining it in the ER, and blocking TAP. Adenovirus E3-19K retains MHC I in the ER. HIV Nef protein downregulates MHC I from the cell surface. However, this creates vulnerability to NK cells (missing self recognition). Statement II is TRUE: Trypanosoma brucei maintains a dense coat of approximately 10^7 VSG molecules. Its genome contains approximately 1,000 VSG genes but expresses only one at a time from a telomeric expression site.

In the secondary response, IgG is significantly elevated by day 2 after re-exposure (day 32), demonstrating the rapid activation of memory B cells that do not require a prolonged lag phase. (2) Predominant isotype: The primary response is dominated by IgM (peaking at 100 units) with relatively little IgG (peaking at 30 units). The secondary response is overwhelmingly IgG (peaking at 800 units) because memory B cells have already undergone class switch recombination. The modest IgM in the secondary response likely comes from newly activated naive B cells. (3) Magnitude: Peak total antibody in the primary response is approximately 130 units (100 IgM + 30 IgG at day 14), while the secondary response reaches approximately 815 units (15 IgM + 800 IgG at day 40) — approximately 6x higher. (4) Affinity: Although not directly measured here, the IgG antibodies in the secondary response would have significantly higher affinity due to somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation that occurred during the primary germinal center reaction.

      "explanation": "These classic experiments by Jacques Miller (1961) established the thymus as the essential organ for T cell development. Group A (neonatal thymectomy) shows severe immunodeficiency because the thymus has not yet seeded the peripheral T cell pool — without any thymic output, no mature T cells are generated, and the animals cannot mount T cell-dependent immune responses. Group B (adult thymectomy) shows only mild initial immunosuppression because the peripheral T cell pool has already been established. Mature T cells in the periphery are remarkably long-lived — some memory T cells can persist for decades through homeostatic proliferation (driven by IL-7 and IL-15 and low-affinity interactions with self-peptide-MHC). However, without thymic output, the T cell repertoire gradually narrows as cells die and are not replaced, explaining the slow decline. Group C (adult thymectomy + irradiation) destroys both the thymus and existing peripheral T cells, recreating the Group A phenotype and proving that surviving peripheral T cells, not the thymus, were maintaining immunity in Group B. Together, these results demonstrate that: the thymus is the primary site of T cell development; it seeds the periphery with mature naive T cells; peripheral T cells are long-lived but require eventual thymic replacement; and the thymus contributes to T cell diversity throughout life.",

Varying effector-to-target ratios (E:T = 1:1, 10:1, 50:1, 100:1) demonstrates dose-dependent killing. The critical control is adding anti-CD16 (anti-FcgammaRIII) blocking antibody to Group 4 — CD16 is the Fc receptor on NK cells that binds the Fc portion of IgG coating the tumor cells.

Measuring responses during the effector phase (day 7-14) would not distinguish effector from memory responses. (2) Challenge — re-exposing to the pathogen tests functional memory. Survival and pathogen clearance kinetics directly measure protective immunity. (3) Quantification of memory T cells — MHC-peptide tetramers (or pentamers) are fluorescently labeled MHC molecules loaded with the specific antigen peptide; they bind specifically to T cells with matching TCRs, allowing precise enumeration by flow cytometry. (4) Functional assessment — intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) after brief ex vivo restimulation measures cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2) by antigen-specific T cells, distinguishing functional memory from anergic cells.

      "explanation": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex that acts as an intracellular danger sensor. Activation is a two-step process: Signal 1 (priming) — NF-kB activation (e.g., by TLR signaling) upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1beta expression. Signal 2 (activation) — diverse danger-associated signals including extracellular ATP (binding P2X7 receptor), potassium efflux, lysosomal destabilization (from phagocytosed crystals like uric acid or silica), mitochondrial ROS, and others trigger NLRP3 oligomerization. The oligomerized NLRP3 recruits the ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD) adaptor, which forms large filamentous structures called ASC specks. ASC recruits pro-caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interactions, leading to proximity-induced auto-activation. Active caspase-1 performs two critical functions: (1) cleaves pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18 into mature, bioactive cytokines that are secreted; (2) cleaves gasdermin D, releasing its N-terminal domain which oligomerizes in the plasma membrane to form large pores, causing a lytic form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Dysregulated NLRP3 activation contributes to gout, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and many other conditions.",

      "explanation": "Somatic hypermutation is a unique mutagenic process that specifically targets the variable region genes of immunoglobulins in activated B cells within germinal centers. The key enzyme is AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), the same enzyme responsible for class switch recombination. AID deaminates cytosine (C) to uracil (U) in single-stranded DNA exposed during transcription of the Ig V region genes. This C-to-U change is then processed through several mutagenic pathways: (1) Replication over the uracil introduces C-to-T transitions. (2) Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) removes the uracil, creating an abasic site; replication over the abasic site introduces any nucleotide (transitions and transversions at C:G pairs). (3) Mismatch repair (MSH2/MSH6) is recruited to the U:G mismatch and introduces errors at neighboring A:T pairs through error-prone polymerase eta. The mutation rate is approximately 10^-3 per base pair per generation — approximately 10^6 times higher than the background somatic mutation rate. After SHM, B cells expressing higher-affinity BCRs compete for limiting antigen on follicular dendritic cells and T follicular helper cell help. Those with improved binding are positively selected (affinity maturation), while those with reduced binding die by apoptosis.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "MHC polymorphism (over 25,000 alleles of HLA class I and II genes in the human population) is maintained by pathogen-driven balancing selection — one of the strongest examples of natural selection in the human genome. Each MHC allele has a unique peptide-binding groove that accommodates peptides with specific anchor residue motifs. Different alleles therefore present different subsets of pathogen-derived peptides. If MHC diversity were low (e.g., if all individuals had identical MHC), a pathogen that evolved to avoid presentation by that particular MHC would evade the entire population's T cell surveillance. With high MHC diversity, most pathogen peptides will be presented by at least some alleles in the population, ensuring population-level resistance. Evidence for pathogen-driven selection includes: (1) heterozygote advantage — MHC heterozygotes present a wider range of peptides and resist infections better (demonstrated for HIV and hepatitis); (2) frequency-dependent selection — rare MHC alleles confer advantage against pathogens adapted to common alleles; (3) MHC alleles show strong signatures of balancing selection at the molecular level (high dN/dS ratio in peptide-binding residues, trans-species polymorphisms). This is why MHC matching is critical for organ transplantation — the extreme polymorphism that benefits pathogen defense creates the organ rejection problem.",

They are defined by expression of CXCR5 (chemokine receptor for CXCL13, which guides them to B cell follicles), the transcription factor Bcl-6, and surface molecules PD-1 and ICOS. In germinal centers, Tfh cells perform several essential functions: (1) B cell selection — Tfh cells examine antigen presented on MHC II by germinal center B cells. B cells that have acquired mutations (through SHM) improving their ability to capture, process, and present antigen receive more Tfh help (positive selection). This is the basis of affinity maturation. (2) Survival signals — CD40L on Tfh cells engages CD40 on B cells, delivering critical anti-apoptotic signals. Without this interaction, germinal center B cells rapidly die by apoptosis. (3) Cytokine support — IL-21 (the signature Tfh cytokine) is the most potent known inducer of plasma cell differentiation. IL-4 from Tfh cells drives IgE and IgG1 class switching. (4) Promoting SHM and CSR — CD40 signaling, together with cytokines, upregulates AID expression in germinal center B cells.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) checkpoint pathway is a physiological mechanism for preventing excessive T cell activation and maintaining peripheral tolerance. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor upregulated on activated T cells. Its ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC), are expressed on antigen-presenting cells and many tissues. When PD-1 engages PD-L1/PD-L2, it recruits the phosphatase SHP-2, which dephosphorylates key signaling molecules downstream of the TCR and CD28, dampening T cell activation. Many tumors exploit this pathway by upregulating PD-L1 expression on their surface (often driven by IFN-gamma from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or by oncogenic signaling). This creates an immunosuppressive shield — T cells that recognize tumor antigens receive inhibitory signals through PD-1 upon encountering PD-L1 on the tumor, leading to T cell exhaustion (a state of progressive functional impairment characterized by reduced effector function, sustained inhibitory receptor expression, and altered transcriptional program driven by TOX). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab targeting PD-1; atezolizumab targeting PD-L1) block this interaction, reinvigorating exhausted T cells.

They are classified into alpha-defensins (found in neutrophil granules and Paneth cells of the small intestine), beta-defensins (produced by epithelial cells of skin, airways, and urogenital tract), and theta-defensins (cyclic, found in some primates). The antimicrobial mechanism exploits a fundamental difference between microbial and host membranes: microbial membranes are rich in negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, LPS) on their outer leaflet, while mammalian cell membranes have negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine) predominantly on the inner leaflet. The cationic defensins are electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged microbial surface. Upon reaching a threshold concentration, defensins insert into the lipid bilayer, oligomerize, and form transmembrane pores or channels. This disrupts membrane potential, causes leakage of cytoplasmic contents, and leads to cell death. Some defensins also have intracellular targets. The selectivity for microbial over host membranes provides a safety margin, though at very high concentrations, defensins can damage host cells. Some defensins also serve as chemokines, recruiting immune cells to infection sites.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Superantigens are among the most potent T cell activators known. Conventional antigens are processed into peptides (8-20 amino acids) and presented within the MHC peptide-binding groove, where they are recognized by specific TCRs — this activates only the tiny fraction (approximately 1 in 10^5 to 10^6) of T cells with matching specificity. Superantigens bypass this entire process: they bind intact (unprocessed) as whole proteins simultaneously to the lateral face of MHC class II molecules (outside the peptide-binding groove) and to the Vbeta domain of the TCR (outside the normal CDR3 antigen-recognition loops). Since superantigen binding depends only on the Vbeta gene segment used, and humans have approximately 50-60 Vbeta families (with specific superantigens binding to multiple families), each superantigen can activate 5-20% of all T cells — compared to 0.001-0.01% for a conventional antigen. This massive polyclonal T cell activation releases enormous quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-2, IFN-gamma) — a cytokine storm that causes fever, hypotension, shock, and multi-organ failure.

The system operates in three phases: (1) Adaptation (immunization) — When a bacterium survives phage infection, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins capture short fragments of phage DNA (protospacers, typically 20-50 bp) and integrate them as new spacer sequences into the CRISPR array, flanked by repeat sequences. This creates a genetic memory of past infections. (2) Expression (biogenesis) — The CRISPR array is transcribed into a long pre-crRNA, which is processed (by Cas6, RNase III, or tracrRNA-dependent mechanisms depending on the system type) into individual crRNAs, each containing one spacer sequence. (3) Interference (immunity) — crRNAs guide Cas effector proteins (e.g., Cas9 in Type II, Cas3 in Type I, Cas13 in Type VI) to complementary sequences in invading phage DNA. The Cas nuclease cleaves the foreign DNA, destroying it. A protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) ensures self-tolerance — the CRISPR array itself lacks PAM sequences, preventing self-cleavage.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Active immunity results from stimulation of the individual's own immune system by antigen, either through natural infection or vaccination. The key feature is that the individual generates their own B and T cell responses, including memory cells that persist long-term (decades for some vaccines). There is a lag period of days to weeks before protective immunity develops. Examples include immunity after measles infection (lifelong) or MMR vaccination (>20 years). Passive immunity involves the transfer of pre-formed immune effectors (usually antibodies) from an immune individual to a non-immune individual. Protection is immediate but temporary because the transferred antibodies have a limited half-life (IgG half-life approximately 21 days) and no memory cells are transferred. Examples include: maternal IgG crossing the placenta (protects neonates for approximately 6 months), maternal IgA in breast milk, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma therapy, and anti-venom/anti-toxin preparations.

Key adaptations include: (1) IgA dominance — The mucosal immune system preferentially induces class switching to IgA (via TGF-beta and APRIL/BAFF from epithelial cells). Secretory IgA provides non-inflammatory immune exclusion by binding pathogens and toxins at the mucosal surface without activating complement or inflammation. (2) Oral/mucosal tolerance — Specialized antigen-presenting cells in the gut (CD103+ dendritic cells) sample luminal antigens and, in the absence of danger signals, induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) producing TGF-beta and IL-10, generating active tolerance. Retinoic acid from gut DCs promotes gut-homing and Treg induction. (3) Organized MALT structures — Peyer's patches (small intestine), tonsils, adenoids, and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) serve as inductive sites for mucosal immunity. M cells in the follicle-associated epithelium transcytose luminal antigens to underlying immune cells.

The membrane components (gp91phox/NOX2 and p22phox, forming cytochrome b558) and cytosolic components (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac GTPase) assemble at the phagosomal membrane. NOX2 catalyzes: NADPH + 2O2 -> NADP+ + 2O2- + H+, transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the membrane to reduce O2 to superoxide anion (O2-) within the phagosome. Superoxide is then converted through several pathways: Superoxide dismutase converts O2- to H2O2. Myeloperoxidase (MPO, which gives pus its green color) catalyzes H2O2 + Cl- -> HOCl (hypochlorous acid, essentially bleach), the most potent antimicrobial oxidant. Fenton chemistry (Fe2+ + H2O2 -> Fe3+ + OH- + OH*) generates hydroxyl radicals. Together, these reactive oxygen species kill bacteria through oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA.

      "explanation": "Allorecognition occurs through two distinct pathways. The direct pathway: Donor-derived APCs (dendritic cells, called passenger leukocytes) migrate from the graft to recipient lymph nodes. Recipient T cells recognize intact foreign MHC molecules on these donor APCs. Remarkably, 1-10% of all T cells cross-react with allogeneic MHC (compared to approximately 0.001% for a specific pathogen), explaining the vigorous rejection response. The indirect pathway: Donor MHC molecules shed from the graft are captured by recipient APCs, processed into peptides, and presented on recipient MHC molecules. This is identical to how foreign protein antigens are normally presented. The direct pathway dominates acute rejection (first weeks to months), while the indirect pathway becomes more important in chronic rejection. Acute cellular rejection involves CD8+ CTLs that directly kill graft cells expressing donor MHC I, and CD4+ T cells that activate macrophages (causing delayed-type hypersensitivity) and provide help for antibody production. Antibody-mediated rejection (involving anti-donor antibodies activating complement and causing endothelial injury) can cause hyperacute rejection (preformed antibodies), acute humoral rejection, or chronic antibody-mediated rejection.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The cGAS-STING pathway is a major innate immune sensing pathway for cytoplasmic DNA detection. cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) is a nucleotidyltransferase enzyme that binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner. DNA in the cytoplasm is a danger signal — it can originate from DNA viruses (herpes, adenovirus), intracellular bacteria (Mycobacterium, Listeria), retroviruses (from reverse-transcribed DNA), or damaged mitochondria and nuclei (self-DNA). Upon binding dsDNA, cGAS undergoes conformational activation and catalyzes the synthesis of 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), a unique cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with mixed 2'-5' and 3'-5' phosphodiester linkages. 2'3'-cGAMP diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes), an ER-resident transmembrane adaptor protein. Activated STING traffics from the ER to the Golgi, where it recruits and activates TBK1 kinase. TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3, which dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and drives transcription of type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) and other antiviral genes. This pathway is critical for antiviral defense and also plays roles in autoimmunity (recognition of self-DNA), cancer immunosurveillance, and cellular senescence.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Helminth parasites are far too large for phagocytosis (adult worms can be meters long). Eosinophils have evolved a specialized extracellular killing mechanism. The process involves: (1) Helminth coating — Helminths are coated with IgE antibodies (produced in Th2-driven responses) and complement C3b. (2) Eosinophil recruitment — IL-5 (from Th2 cells) and eotaxin (CCL11) recruit and activate eosinophils, which express Fc receptors for IgE (FcepsilonRII/CD23 and FcepsilonRI) and complement receptors. (3) Degranulation — When eosinophils bind antibody-coated helminths through their Fc receptors, they undergo regulated degranulation, releasing their specific granule contents directly onto the parasite surface. Key granule proteins include: Major basic protein (MBP) — a highly cationic cytotoxin that disrupts lipid bilayers; Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) — a ribonuclease with membrane-damaging activity; Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) — generates reactive oxygen species (similar to neutrophil MPO); Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) — a ribonuclease toxic to neurons and parasites. (4) These proteins collectively damage the helminth tegument (surface covering), compromising its integrity. This ADCC-like mechanism is critical for anti-helminth defense. Unfortunately, the same eosinophil products cause tissue damage in allergic diseases like asthma.",

They arrive as double-negative (DN, CD4-CD8-) thymocytes and progress through DN1-DN4 stages. During DN3, the TCR beta chain undergoes V(D)J recombination. A successfully rearranged beta chain pairs with a surrogate pre-T-alpha chain (beta-selection checkpoint). If successful, the cells proliferate and upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double-positive (DP). The TCR alpha chain then rearranges. Statement II is TRUE: Positive selection occurs in the thymic cortex, mediated by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). DP thymocytes that can bind self-peptide-MHC with moderate affinity receive survival signals. The approximately 95% of thymocytes whose randomly generated TCR cannot recognize any self-MHC die by apoptosis (death by neglect). Positive selection also determines lineage commitment: TCRs binding MHC I become CD8+ T cells, while those binding MHC II become CD4+ T cells. Statement III is TRUE: Negatively selected thymocytes (those binding self-peptide-MHC with high affinity, indicating potential autoreactivity) undergo apoptosis in the medulla, mediated by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) expressing AIRE.

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: Live attenuated vaccines use pathogens weakened through serial passage in culture or genetic modification. They replicate in the host, mimicking natural infection without causing disease. This generates robust humoral immunity (all antibody classes including IgA at mucosal sites), strong CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and durable immunological memory, often with a single dose. Limitations include risk in immunocompromised individuals and potential reversion to virulence. Statement II is TRUE: mRNA vaccines are a revolutionary platform. Synthetic mRNA (modified with pseudouridine for stability and reduced innate immune sensing) is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles for cellular uptake. Host ribosomes translate the mRNA into protein (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), which is then processed and presented on MHC I and II, generating both antibody and T cell responses. mRNA cannot integrate into the genome (it lacks reverse transcriptase and does not enter the nucleus), and it is degraded within days. Statement III is TRUE: Toxoid vaccines use chemically inactivated toxins (typically with formaldehyde). The immune response targets the toxin, not the bacterium — this provides anti-toxin immunity (neutralizing antibodies) but does not prevent colonization by the organism. Statement IV is TRUE: Polysaccharide antigens are T-independent — they activate B cells without T cell help, producing mainly IgM with no memory. Conjugating polysaccharides to protein carriers (e.g., tetanus toxoid, CRM197) enables CD4+ T cell help, promoting class switching to IgG, affinity maturation, and memory. This is critical because children under 2 years respond poorly to T-independent antigens.",

      "explanation": "Statement I is TRUE: All three complement pathways converge at C3 convertase formation. The classical pathway C3 convertase is C4b2a (formed after C1q binds antibody-antigen complexes, activating C1r and C1s, which cleave C4 and C2). The lectin pathway C3 convertase is also C4b2a (formed when mannose-binding lectin/MBL or ficolins bind mannose on pathogens, activating MASP-1/MASP-2). The alternative pathway C3 convertase is C3bBb (formed by spontaneous C3 hydrolysis and Factor B/Factor D amplification). All cleave C3 into C3a (anaphylatoxin) and C3b (opsonin). Statement II is TRUE: C3b contains a reactive thioester bond (between cysteine and glutamine in the thioester domain) that becomes exposed upon C3 cleavage. This thioester reacts with hydroxyl or amino groups on nearby surfaces, forming covalent ester or amide bonds. This ensures C3b deposits on the activating surface rather than diffusing away. Phagocytes bearing complement receptors (CR1/CD35 recognizes C3b; CR3/CD11b-CD18 recognizes iC3b) then efficiently phagocytose opsonized pathogens. Statement III is FALSE: The complement system is part of the INNATE immune system. The alternative and lectin pathways activate without antibodies. Only the classical pathway requires antibodies (IgM or IgG), linking it to adaptive immunity. Statement IV is TRUE: C3a and C5a are potent inflammatory mediators. C5a is particularly important — it is the strongest known chemotactic factor for neutrophils and also activates endothelial cells, mast cells, and macrophages.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "These data illustrate the classic natural history of untreated HIV infection. The acute phase (weeks 0-8) shows massive viral replication: HIV infects activated CD4+ T cells (particularly in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, where 60% of all CD4+ T cells reside), causing a viremia spike reaching millions of copies/mL. This coincides with a dramatic drop in CD4+ count. The immune response then partially controls the virus: HIV-specific CD8+ CTLs emerge around week 3 and kill infected cells, while neutralizing antibodies appear later. By week 8-12, the immune response drives viral load down to a 'set point' — a quasi-steady state where viral production and immune-mediated clearance are balanced. The set point viral load (here approximately 50,000-100,000 copies/mL) is a powerful predictor of disease progression: patients with low set points (less than 10,000) progress slowly (greater than 10 years to AIDS), while those with high set points (greater than 100,000) progress rapidly (less than 5 years). The set point is determined by the quality of the CTL response (influenced by HLA type), viral fitness, and host genetic factors (e.g., CCR5 expression levels). During the chronic (clinical latency) phase, CD4+ counts slowly decline as the virus continuously replicates and immune activation causes immune exhaustion. When CD4 drops below 200/uL (year 8-10), AIDS develops.",

      "explanation": "These flow cytometry data reveal important principles of T cell immunology. Naive antigen-specific T cell precursor frequency: Before immunization, the frequency of T cells specific for any given peptide-MHC complex is approximately 1 in 10^5 to 10^6 total T cells (or about 10-100 antigen-specific CD4 cells in a lymph node of 10 million cells). After immunization, the 32,000 OVA-specific CD4+ cells represent approximately 1% of all CD4+ cells — this is a massive clonal expansion of approximately 100-1000 fold from the naive precursor frequency, consistent with a robust immune response at day 7 (the peak of the primary response). The MHC-II-OVA tetramer specifically detects CD4+ T cells because it presents peptide on MHC class II — the minimal CD8+ tetramer+ staining (180 cells) represents background/non-specific binding, not a true CD8 response to the MHC-II tetramer. To detect OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, one would need an MHC-I-OVA peptide tetramer (e.g., H-2Kb-SIINFEKL for OVA257-264).

M1 macrophages are highly microbicidal: they express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2), which converts L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline — NO is directly toxic to intracellular pathogens. They produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) and reactive oxygen species. M1 macrophages are critical for killing intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M2 (alternatively activated) macrophages are driven by IL-4 and IL-13 (from Th2 cells, basophils, eosinophils) with additional signals from IL-10, TGF-beta, and glucocorticoids.

They recognize diverse ligands including phosphoantigens (isoprenoid pathway intermediates like IPP from bacteria, and HMBPP from the MEP pathway), lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules, stress-induced molecules (MICA, MICB), and some non-classical MHC molecules. (2) Innate-like behavior — gamma-delta T cells can respond rapidly (within hours) to infection without requiring prior clonal expansion or differentiation, functioning more like innate immune cells. They express pattern recognition receptors and respond to danger signals. (3) Tissue residency — they are enriched at barrier surfaces where they provide first-line defense, immunosurveillance, and tissue homeostasis.

      "explanation": "Cross-presentation violates the conventional rules of antigen presentation, which dictate that endogenous antigens are presented on MHC I (to CD8+ T cells) and exogenous antigens on MHC II (to CD4+ T cells). In cross-presentation, exogenous antigens taken up from the extracellular environment (through phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, or receptor-mediated endocytosis) are diverted into the MHC class I presentation pathway instead of, or in addition to, the MHC II pathway. Two mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the vacuolar pathway — antigens are processed by proteases in endosomes/phagosomes and loaded onto MHC I molecules recycling through the endosomal compartment; (2) the cytosolic pathway — antigens escape from endosomes into the cytosol, are processed by the proteasome, transported by TAP into the ER, and loaded onto MHC I in the conventional manner. Cross-presentation is critically important because many pathogens (especially non-cytopathic viruses and tumors) do not infect dendritic cells. Without cross-presentation, these pathogens could not be presented on MHC I to activate CD8+ CTL responses. Only certain dendritic cell subsets efficiently cross-present: CD8alpha+ DCs in mice and CD141+ (BDCA-3+) DCs in humans, which express specialized machinery including the DNGR-1 receptor.",

        "Germ-free mice have hyperactive immune systems with excessive inflammation throughout the body",
        "Germ-free mice have underdeveloped gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches), reduced IgA production, fewer Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria, reduced regulatory T cell populations, and impaired systemic immune responses",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Germ-free mice are a powerful tool for understanding microbiome-immune interactions. They exhibit multiple immune deficiencies: (1) Structural deficits — Underdeveloped Peyer's patches with fewer and smaller germinal centers, thinner intestinal lamina propria with fewer immune cells, smaller mesenteric lymph nodes, and reduced isolated lymphoid follicles. (2) IgA deficiency — Dramatically reduced secretory IgA production, which normally shapes and is shaped by the microbiota (IgA-bacteria co-evolution). (3) T cell deficits — Reduced Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (normally induced by segmented filamentous bacteria/SFB) and reduced regulatory T cell populations (normally induced by Clostridia and Bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide A). (4) Systemic effects — Impaired splenic architecture, reduced circulating IgG levels, and impaired ability to clear systemic infections. These deficits demonstrate that the immune system requires microbial input for proper development and calibration. Colonization of germ-free mice with specific bacterial species can rescue specific immune deficiencies — SFB restores Th17, Clostridia restores Tregs, Bacteroides restores IgA. This has profound implications for understanding how early-life antibiotic use and reduced microbial exposure may contribute to immune dysregulation and allergic/autoimmune disease.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Opsonization (from the Greek 'opsonin,' meaning to prepare food for eating) is the process by which molecules coat a pathogen surface to enhance its phagocytosis. IgG antibodies are the primary opsonins (particularly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses in humans). The mechanism involves: (1) Antibody binding — IgG antibodies bind to surface antigens on the pathogen through their Fab regions, with the Fc portions pointing outward. (2) Fc receptor engagement — Phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes) express Fc-gamma receptors (FcgammaRI/CD64, FcgammaRIIA/CD32, FcgammaRIII/CD16) that bind the Fc portion of IgG. FcgammaRI has the highest affinity and can bind monomeric IgG, while others require immune complexes. (3) Enhanced phagocytosis — Fc receptor engagement triggers signaling cascades (ITAM phosphorylation) that initiate actin polymerization, membrane extension, and engulfment. Opsonized particles are phagocytosed 10-100 times more efficiently than unopsonized ones. (4) Activation — Fc receptor signaling also activates antimicrobial mechanisms (respiratory burst, granule fusion) within the phagolysosome. Complement C3b also functions as an opsonin through complement receptor CR1. IgG and C3b together create synergistic opsonization, maximizing phagocytic efficiency.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Type III hypersensitivity involves the formation of immune complexes (antigen-antibody aggregates) that deposit in tissues, particularly in blood vessel walls, kidney glomeruli, joint synovium, and skin. The deposited complexes activate the classical complement pathway, generating anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) that recruit neutrophils. Neutrophils attempt to phagocytose the immune complexes but, being unable to internalize them from the tissue substrate, undergo frustrated phagocytosis — releasing their toxic granule contents (proteases, reactive oxygen species) onto the tissue surface, causing local damage. SLE is the prototypical Type III disease: patients produce antibodies against self-nuclear antigens (dsDNA, histones, ribonuclear proteins). These form immune complexes that circulate and deposit in multiple organs. In the kidney (lupus nephritis), immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane activates complement and recruits inflammatory cells, potentially causing renal failure. Similar deposition causes vasculitis, arthritis, and skin rashes. Other Type III diseases include serum sickness, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and Arthus reaction. Option A describes Type I. Option C describes Type IV. Option D describes Type II (cytotoxic).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "CAR-T cell therapy represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. The process involves: (1) Leukapheresis — T cells are collected from the patient's blood. (2) Genetic engineering — T cells are transduced with a viral vector (usually lentivirus or retrovirus) encoding a chimeric antigen receptor. The CAR structure consists of: an extracellular domain — typically a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a tumor-associated antigen (e.g., CD19 on B cell malignancies); a hinge/spacer region; a transmembrane domain; and intracellular signaling domains — the CD3-zeta chain (providing TCR-like signal 1) plus co-stimulatory domains (CD28, 4-1BB/CD137, or both, providing signal 2). Second-generation CARs include one co-stimulatory domain; third-generation include two. (3) Expansion — CAR-T cells are expanded in vitro to billions of cells. (4) Infusion — After lymphodepleting chemotherapy, CAR-T cells are infused into the patient. The key advantage is MHC independence — CARs recognize surface antigens directly (like antibodies), bypassing the need for MHC presentation that tumors often downregulate. FDA-approved CAR-T therapies (Kymriah, Yescarta) target CD19 and have achieved remarkable complete remission rates in B cell lymphomas and leukemias. Major challenges include cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.",

Include classic NK cells and tissue-resident ILC1s. Important for antiviral and antibacterial defense. ILC2 — Express GATA-3, produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 (like Th2 cells). Activated by epithelial-derived alarmins: IL-33 (from damaged epithelial cells), IL-25 (from tuft cells), and TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin). ILC2s are critical for anti-helminth immunity (IL-13 drives goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production, IL-5 recruits eosinophils) and contribute to allergic inflammation (type 2 airway inflammation in asthma). They are enriched in the lung, gut, and skin. ILC3 — Express ROR-gamma-t, produce IL-17 and IL-22 (like Th17 cells). Include lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells that drive lymphoid organ development.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps) were discovered in 2004 and represent a novel form of cell death called NETosis. The process involves: (1) Activation — Neutrophils are stimulated by pathogens, PMA, LPS, IL-8, or immune complexes. (2) Chromatin decondensation — NADPH oxidase generates ROS, which activate peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). PAD4 citrullinates histones, weakening histone-DNA electrostatic interactions and causing massive chromatin decondensation. Simultaneously, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase translocate from granules to the nucleus, further disrupting chromatin structure. (3) NET release — The nuclear membrane dissolves, and the decondensed chromatin mixes with cytoplasmic and granule components. The plasma membrane ruptures, expelling the chromatin-antimicrobial protein complex into the extracellular space. (4) Pathogen trapping and killing — The expelled DNA forms a web-like meshwork that physically traps bacteria, fungi, and even parasites. The embedded antimicrobial proteins (elastase, cathepsin G, myeloperoxidase, defensins, lactoferrin, calprotectin) kill trapped pathogens. Histones themselves are antimicrobial due to their positive charge disrupting bacterial membranes. While NETs are important for defense against large or aggregated pathogens, excessive NETosis contributes to autoimmunity (SLE — DNA-anti-DNA complexes), thrombosis, and tissue damage in sepsis.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Th17 differentiation is driven by a unique cytokine combination. TGF-beta alone would drive Foxp3 expression and regulatory T cell (Treg) development. However, when TGF-beta is combined with IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to infection), the signaling pathway is diverted. IL-6 activates STAT3, which induces the master transcription factor ROR-gamma-t (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma-t). ROR-gamma-t drives the expression of Th17 signature genes including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and CCR6. TGF-beta is needed to suppress alternative differentiation programs (inhibiting T-bet for Th1 and GATA-3 for Th2). IL-21 can substitute for IL-6 in an autocrine amplification loop (Th17 cells produce IL-21, which promotes further Th17 differentiation). IL-23 is critical for the maintenance, expansion, and pathogenic function of Th17 cells (but not for initial differentiation). This Th17 pathway defends against extracellular bacteria (Staphylococcus, Klebsiella) and fungi (Candida) by inducing neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells. Patients with defects in IL-17 signaling develop chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Pathogenic Th17 responses contribute to multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Herd immunity (community immunity) threshold depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, quantified by R0 (the basic reproduction number — the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case in a completely susceptible population). The formula: Herd immunity threshold = 1 - 1/R0. This represents the minimum proportion of the population that must be immune to drive the effective reproduction number (Re) below 1, causing the epidemic to decline. For highly transmissible diseases: Measles (R0 approximately 12-18): threshold = 1 - 1/15 = 93.3%. This explains why measles outbreaks occur when vaccination rates drop even slightly below 95%. Pertussis (R0 approximately 12-17): threshold = approximately 92-94%. For less transmissible diseases: Influenza (R0 approximately 2-3): threshold = approximately 50-67%. COVID-19 (original strain R0 approximately 2.5-3): threshold approximately 60-67%. Polio (R0 approximately 5-7): threshold approximately 80-86%. The formula assumes homogeneous mixing and uniform vaccine efficacy, which are simplifications. Real-world herd immunity also depends on population structure, waning immunity, and the durability of vaccine-induced versus natural immunity. Herd immunity protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (infants, immunocompromised) by reducing their exposure to circulating pathogens.",

Co-receptors CD4 and CD8 also bind MHC II and I respectively, contributing to signaling through Lck kinase recruitment. Statement II is TRUE: Co-stimulation is essential for full T cell activation. The primary co-stimulatory pathway is CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on the APC binding CD28 on the T cell. CD28 signaling activates PI3K, enhances IL-2 production, promotes cell survival (upregulating Bcl-xL), and enhances T cell metabolism. TCR signaling without co-stimulation (Signal 1 without Signal 2) leads to T cell anergy — a state of functional unresponsiveness where the T cell remains alive but cannot be fully activated upon restimulation. This is a key mechanism of peripheral tolerance, as resting tissue cells present self-antigens on MHC but do not express co-stimulatory molecules.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "These data beautifully illustrate the temporal orchestration of immune cell recruitment. Phase 1 — Neutrophil dominance (0-48 hours): Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited, increasing 300-fold by 24 hours. They are recruited by chemokines (IL-8/CXCL8, C5a, LTB4) released by tissue-resident sentinels (macrophages, mast cells). Neutrophils are short-lived (6-12 hour tissue lifespan) and are rapidly replaced — explaining the peak at 24h and subsequent decline. They provide critical early pathogen killing through phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETs. Phase 2 — Monocyte/macrophage transition (24h-5 days): Monocytes are recruited by CCL2/MCP-1 and differentiate into macrophages in the tissue. Their numbers rise more slowly but persist longer. Macrophages serve dual roles: continuing pathogen clearance (phagocytosis of pathogens and dead neutrophils — efferocytosis) and bridging to adaptive immunity through antigen presentation and cytokine production. Phase 3 — T cell dominance (5-10 days): T cells arrive last because adaptive immunity requires antigen processing, T cell priming in lymph nodes (1-3 days), clonal expansion (2-4 days), and migration to infected tissue. By day 10, T cells dominate, providing antigen-specific killing (CD8+ CTLs) and macrophage activation (CD4+ Th1 IFN-gamma). This sequence — neutrophils first, then macrophages, then T cells — is a fundamental principle of immune defense.",

      "options": [
        "Delete the MHC class II gene to prevent all adaptive immune responses",
        "Delete the mu heavy chain gene (IgM heavy chain constant region), which prevents B cell development at the pre-B cell stage since surface IgM is required for B cell receptor signaling and survival; alternatively, use a muMT (mu membrane-transmembrane) knockout that specifically prevents surface IgM expression while preserving the mu gene",
        "Delete the IL-2 gene to prevent all lymphocyte proliferation",
        "Delete the thymus to eliminate all B cells, since B cells develop in the thymus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Creating B cell-deficient mice requires targeting a gene essential for B cell development but dispensable for T cells and other immune cells. The mu heavy chain (IgM) is the ideal target because: (1) B cell development requires expression of a functional pre-BCR (surrogate light chain + mu heavy chain) at the pre-B cell stage for survival and proliferation signals. Without mu heavy chain, B cell development arrests at the pro-B to pre-B transition, and essentially no mature B cells develop. (2) The muMT knockout mouse (deletion of the transmembrane exons of the mu gene) is the classic model — these mice lack surface IgM, preventing BCR signaling, and have virtually no B cells or antibodies. However, secreted IgM from the existing mu gene is also absent. (3) This approach does not affect T cell development (which occurs in the thymus and uses TCR, not BCR), NK cells, macrophages, or other immune components. The experiment would then compare pathogen challenge in wild-type versus muMT mice: if B cell-deficient mice have impaired pathogen clearance, antibodies are important. Additional controls: adoptive transfer of purified antibodies into muMT mice to test if antibodies alone can restore protection (reconstitution experiment). Option A would affect CD4 T cells, not specifically B cells. Option C would broadly affect many cell types. Option D is incorrect — B cells develop in the bone marrow.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Testing a specific commensal's role in immune tolerance requires a well-controlled experimental design. Using germ-free NOD mice eliminates confounding effects of the existing microbiome. The experimental groups should be: Group 1 — Germ-free NOD mice (disease baseline without microbiome). Group 2 — Germ-free NOD + Bacterium X (test group). Group 3 — Germ-free NOD + control commensal (e.g., E. coli K12, to test if any bacterium prevents disease). Group 4 — Germ-free NOD + heat-killed Bacterium X (tests whether live bacteria are needed vs. microbial molecular patterns alone). Group 5 — Specific pathogen-free NOD mice (conventional microbiome control). Outcomes should include: (1) Diabetes incidence and onset timing (blood glucose monitoring weekly). (2) Insulitis scoring — histological grading of immune cell infiltration into pancreatic islets. (3) Immunological mechanisms — Treg (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) frequency in pancreatic lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes by flow cytometry; cytokine profiling (IL-10, TGF-beta for tolerance vs. IFN-gamma, IL-17 for pathogenicity); dendritic cell phenotyping for tolerogenic markers (CD103, RALDH). (4) Specificity — confirm bacterial colonization and measure anti-islet autoantibodies. If Bacterium X prevents diabetes with expanded Tregs, while heat-killed bacteria and control bacteria do not, this provides strong evidence for a specific, live-bacterium-dependent tolerogenic mechanism.",

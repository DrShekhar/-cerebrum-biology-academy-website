      "options": [
        "They activate membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate cytoplasmic targets",
        "They bind intracellular nuclear receptors, forming hormone-receptor complexes that act as transcription factors by binding to hormone response elements (HREs) in DNA",
        "They directly phosphorylate transcription factors in the cytoplasm without entering the nucleus",
        "They activate G-protein-coupled receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, estradiol, testosterone, progesterone) are lipophilic molecules that freely cross the plasma membrane. Inside the cell, they bind to intracellular nuclear receptors (which may be located in the cytoplasm or already in the nucleus, depending on the receptor type). The hormone-receptor complex undergoes conformational change, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus (if cytoplasmic), where it binds specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. Acting as ligand-activated transcription factors, they recruit coactivators or corepressors to modulate gene transcription. This genomic mechanism explains the relatively slow onset (hours) but prolonged duration of steroid hormone effects compared to peptide hormones that act via surface receptors.",

      "options": [
        "TRH from the hypothalamus stimulates TSH release from the anterior pituitary; TSH stimulates T3/T4 release from the thyroid; elevated T3/T4 inhibit both TRH and TSH secretion",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The HPT axis follows the classic three-tier hierarchical pattern. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) into the hypophyseal portal system. TRH stimulates thyrotroph cells in the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin). TSH travels through the systemic circulation to the thyroid gland, where it binds TSH receptors (Gs-coupled GPCRs) on follicular cells, stimulating synthesis and release of thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine, the predominant product) and T3 (triiodothyronine, more active). Elevated circulating T3/T4 exert negative feedback at two levels: (1) inhibiting TRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and (2) directly inhibiting TSH release from anterior pituitary thyrotrophs. Most T3 is produced by peripheral deiodination of T4 by type 1 and type 2 deiodinases.",

      "explanation": "(I) TRUE: The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric (α₂β₂) receptor tyrosine kinase. Insulin binding to the α subunits causes conformational change and trans-autophosphorylation of the β subunits on specific tyrosine residues, creating docking sites for IRS-1 and IRS-2. (II) TRUE: IRS phosphorylation activates PI3K, generating PIP₃, which activates PDK1 and subsequently Akt (protein kinase B). Akt phosphorylates AS160 (TBC1D4), promoting GLUT4-containing vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. This dramatically increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. (III) TRUE: Akt phosphorylates and INACTIVATES GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), which normally phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase. Thus insulin indirectly activates glycogen synthase, promoting glycogen storage. (IV) FALSE: Neurons use GLUT1 and GLUT3, and red blood cells use GLUT1 — these transporters are constitutively expressed and insulin-independent. Brain and RBCs take up glucose regardless of insulin levels.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The adrenal medulla is a modified sympathetic ganglion that produces catecholamines — approximately 80% epinephrine and 20% norepinephrine. Pheochromocytoma causes paroxysmal (episodic) or sustained overproduction of catecholamines, leading to the classic triad: episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia, along with severe hypertension. The hypertension results from α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction (norepinephrine) and cardiac stimulation via β1 receptors (epinephrine). Episodes can be triggered by physical activity, stress, or certain foods. Option A describes adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), option C describes Cushing's syndrome (cortisol excess), and option D describes hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease). Diagnosis involves measuring urinary catecholamines and their metabolites (metanephrines, VMA). Treatment is surgical resection after α-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) followed by β-blockade.",

This constellation — primary hypothyroidism with high anti-TPO antibodies — is pathognomonic for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions. In Graves' disease, T3/T4 would be elevated with suppressed TSH. In secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary failure), TSH would be low or inappropriately normal despite low T4/T3, and anti-TPO would be negative. In thyroid hormone resistance, T4/T3 are elevated with non-suppressed TSH due to mutant thyroid hormone receptors.",

      "options": [
        "PTH directly stimulates osteoblasts to deposit calcium into the blood from bone",
        "PTH stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (indirectly via RANKL), increases renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal tubule, and promotes calcitriol (1,25-(OH)₂D₃) synthesis to enhance intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "PTH raises blood calcium through three coordinated mechanisms at three target organs: (1) Bone: PTH binds PTH1R receptors on osteoBLASTS (not osteoclasts directly), stimulating them to produce RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand). RANKL binds RANK on osteoclast precursors, promoting their differentiation into mature osteoclasts that resorb bone, releasing Ca²⁺ and phosphate. OPG (osteoprotegerin), a decoy receptor for RANKL, is simultaneously downregulated. (2) Kidney: PTH increases Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (via TRPV5 channels and calbindin) while decreasing phosphate reabsorption proximally (via NaPi-IIa internalization). PTH also activates 1α-hydroxylase, converting 25-(OH)D₃ to active 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol). (3) Intestine: Calcitriol increases intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption via TRPV6 channels and calbindin-D9k — an indirect PTH effect.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "To rigorously demonstrate hormone function, the classical criteria (analogous to Koch's postulates for hormones) require: (1) Identification of the source: the peptide must be produced by specific endocrine cells and released into the bloodstream. (2) Regulated secretion: blood levels should change in response to physiological stimuli (here, food intake). (3) Target tissue with specific receptor: a receptor for the peptide must be identified in a distant target tissue, distinguishing hormonal from paracrine/autocrine action. (4) Biological effect: injection of purified peptide should reproduce the observed physiological response. (5) Specificity: a receptor antagonist or antibody should block the effect. Option B is necessary but insufficient — mere presence in blood doesn't prove function. Option C would identify a neurotransmitter, not a hormone. Option D is flawed because compensation/redundancy might mask the phenotype.",

      "explanation": "Growth hormone secretion is under dual hypothalamic control: (1) Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus, stimulates GH release from somatotroph cells via Gs-coupled GHRH receptors that increase cAMP. (2) Somatostatin (SS, also called growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, GHIH), produced by periventricular neurons, inhibits GH release via Gi-coupled SST receptors that decrease cAMP. GH secretion is pulsatile, with the largest pulses during slow-wave sleep, resulting from alternating GHRH stimulation and somatostatin withdrawal. Additionally, ghrelin (from the stomach) stimulates GH release via the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Negative feedback operates at multiple levels: GH inhibits its own secretion by stimulating somatostatin release and inhibiting GHRH, while IGF-1 (produced by the liver in response to GH) also suppresses GH at both hypothalamic and pituitary levels.",

      "explanation": "The epinephrine signaling cascade is a textbook example of signal amplification through an enzymatic cascade. Each step amplifies the signal: (1) One epinephrine molecule activates one β-adrenergic receptor → (2) One receptor activates multiple Gs proteins (amplification ~10×) → (3) Each Gs activates one adenylyl cyclase, which produces many cAMP molecules (~100×) → (4) Each cAMP activates PKA, and each PKA phosphorylates many phosphorylase kinase molecules (~10×) → (5) Each phosphorylase kinase activates many glycogen phosphorylase molecules (~10×) → (6) Each phosphorylase cleaves many glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen (~100×). The multiplicative effect through 5+ enzymatic steps yields approximately 10⁸ glucose molecules from one hormone-receptor binding event.

ACTH from anterior pituitary corticotrophs is the primary regulator, acting through MC2R (melanocortin 2 receptor) to stimulate steroidogenesis via the StAR protein and steroidogenic enzymes. (III) TRUE: The inner zona reticularis produces weak androgens (DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione), regulated by ACTH.

Ecdysone (produced by the prothoracic gland, stimulated by PTTH from the brain) triggers each molt by activating the nuclear receptor EcR/USP heterodimer, inducing genes for cuticle synthesis and apolysis. JH (produced by the corpora allata) determines the QUALITY of the molt: (1) High JH + ecdysone → larva-to-larva molt (maintains larval gene expression programs). (2) Low JH + ecdysone → larva-to-pupa molt in holometabolous insects, or nymph-to-adult molt in hemimetabolous insects. (3) Absence of JH + ecdysone → pupa-to-adult molt (metamorphosis). JH maintains the 'status quo' — it is a 'juvenilizing' hormone. Its gradual decline during larval development, controlled by JH esterase and JH epoxide hydrolase degradation, permits progressive developmental transitions.

Crucially, their fasting insulin is ELEVATED, indicating the pancreas is producing insulin but tissues are not responding — this is the hallmark of insulin resistance / type 2 diabetes. The hyperinsulinemia represents compensatory β-cell hypersecretion. Group Y has normal fasting glucose (85) but delayed glucose clearance (peak 250, returns near normal at 120). Their very LOW fasting insulin indicates insulin deficiency — consistent with early type 1 diabetes (autoimmune β-cell destruction) or a model thereof.

The posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis — pars nervosa, infundibular stalk, and median eminence) derives from the infundibulum, a downward extension of the neuroectoderm from the floor of the diencephalon (hypothalamus). During development, Rathke's pouch migrates upward and loses its connection to the oral cavity, while the infundibulum grows downward. They meet and fuse to form the mature pituitary. This dual origin explains why the anterior pituitary is a true endocrine gland (epithelial cells producing hormones) while the posterior pituitary is neural tissue (storing and releasing hypothalamic hormones).",

      "explanation": "In Addison's disease, the adrenal cortex is destroyed (commonly by autoimmune adrenalitis, tuberculosis, or other causes), leading to deficiency of ALL adrenal cortical hormones: cortisol (glucocorticoid), aldosterone (mineralocorticoid), and adrenal androgens. Due to loss of negative feedback from cortisol, ACTH levels rise dramatically. Importantly, ACTH is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which also produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Elevated POMC processing leads to increased α-MSH, causing characteristic skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation — a hallmark sign of primary adrenal insufficiency. In secondary adrenal insufficiency (pituitary ACTH deficiency), cortisol is low but ACTH is also low, aldosterone is relatively preserved (since its regulation depends primarily on RAAS and K⁺, not ACTH), and hyperpigmentation is absent.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The parabiosis experiment between ob/ob and wild-type mice is one of the most elegant experiments in endocrinology history (Coleman, 1973). When circulatory systems are surgically joined, the ob/ob mouse (which lacks leptin) receives leptin from the wild-type partner via the shared circulation. If the hypothesis is correct, the ob/ob mouse should reduce food intake and lose weight — which is exactly what happened. The reciprocal experiment with db/db mice (which produce leptin but lack its receptor) showed that db/db mice did NOT respond to parabiosis with wild-type mice, confirming the receptor defect. Injecting recombinant leptin directly into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice specifically demonstrates the site of action. Diet restriction (option A) would cause weight loss regardless of leptin. Measuring ob gene mRNA (option D) would show it's mutated but doesn't test function.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thyroid hormone receptors (TRα and TRβ) are unusual among nuclear receptors because they constitutively occupy thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA even in the absence of ligand (T3). In the unliganded state, TR/RXR heterodimers recruit corepressor complexes (NCoR — nuclear receptor corepressor, and SMRT — silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors), which in turn recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs condense chromatin and actively REPRESS transcription of target genes below basal levels. When T3 binds, conformational change in TR causes release of corepressors and recruitment of coactivator complexes (SRC/p160 family), which recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that open chromatin and activate transcription. This 'derepression plus activation' model explains why hypothyroidism causes more severe effects than simply lacking a hormone — the unliganded receptor actively represses genes that would otherwise be transcribed at basal levels.",

Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. (3) Delta cells (~3-10%) produce SOMATOSTATIN, which inhibits both insulin and glucagon secretion via paracrine signaling — acting as a local brake on islet hormone release.

Hyperpigmentation is NOT a typical feature of Cushing's syndrome — it occurs in Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) where ACTH is elevated. In most Cushing's syndrome cases, the cause is either exogenous glucocorticoids (ACTH is suppressed) or a pituitary adenoma (ACTH is elevated but usually not enough for significant hyperpigmentation).

When extracellular Ca²⁺ rises, Ca²⁺ ions bind CaSR on parathyroid chief cells, activating PLC-IP₃-DAG signaling, which inhibits PTH secretion. This creates the negative feedback loop: high Ca²⁺ → CaSR activation → decreased PTH → decreased blood Ca²⁺. Activating (gain-of-function) mutations in CaSR make the receptor hypersensitive to calcium, so it signals 'calcium is high' even at normal Ca²⁺ levels, suppressing PTH and causing autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH). Patients present with hypocalcemia, low PTH, and relative hypercalciuria. Conversely, inactivating (loss-of-function) mutations make the receptor insensitive to calcium, requiring higher Ca²⁺ to suppress PTH, causing familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) — asymptomatic mild hypercalcemia with low urinary calcium.",

      "explanation": "Normal cortisol secretion follows a circadian (diurnal) pattern driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus: highest in the early morning (~15-25 μg/dL at 8 AM, the 'cortisol awakening response'), declining throughout the day, with a nadir at midnight (~1-5 μg/dL). The healthy subject shows this classic pattern (18→3). The patient shows: (1) elevated cortisol at all time points, (2) LOSS of normal diurnal variation (only modest decline from 35 to 28), and (3) failure to suppress with low-dose dexamethasone. Loss of diurnal variation is one of the earliest features of Cushing's syndrome, often preceding overt hypercortisolism. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that should suppress ACTH and cortisol via negative feedback — failure to suppress confirms autonomous cortisol production. The next diagnostic step would be high-dose dexamethasone suppression and ACTH measurement to distinguish pituitary, adrenal, and ectopic sources.",

However, the first COMMITTED step toward prostaglandins specifically is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX, also called prostaglandin H₂ synthase). COX converts AA to prostaglandin G₂ (via cyclooxygenase activity) and then to prostaglandin H₂ (via peroxidase activity). PGH₂ is then converted by tissue-specific synthases to various prostaglandins (PGE₂, PGD₂, PGF₂α, PGI₂/prostacyclin) and thromboxane A₂. Two major COX isoforms exist: COX-1 (constitutive, housekeeping functions) and COX-2 (inducible by inflammation). NSAIDs inhibit COX: aspirin irreversibly acetylates COX (explaining its antiplatelet effect — platelets cannot synthesize new COX), while ibuprofen and naproxen reversibly compete with AA.

(2) Arteriovenous (A-V) concentration differences across candidate organs during exercise would definitively identify which organ RELEASES Factor X into the circulation. If venous blood leaving an organ has higher Factor X concentration than arterial blood entering it, that organ is secreting Factor X.

The regulation pathway is: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, the master circadian clock) → paraventricular nucleus → intermediolateral column of spinal cord → superior cervical ganglion → postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine → β1-adrenergic receptors on pinealocytes → cAMP → PKA → AANAT activation and stabilization. Light detected by retinal photoreceptors (melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs) signals the SCN, which INHIBITS the sympathetic pathway during daytime.

      "explanation": "During Drosophila metamorphosis (pupariation), a large ecdysone pulse activates the nuclear hormone receptor heterodimer EcR/USP (Ecdysone receptor/Ultraspiracle, the insect homolog of RXR). This complex binds ecdysone response elements (EcREs) on DNA, directly inducing a cascade of transcription factors organized as early genes (E74A, E75, BR-C/Broad-Complex) and late genes. These transcription factors have tissue-specific effects: (1) In larval tissues (larval salivary glands, larval midgut, larval muscles), they activate programmed cell death (autophagy and apoptosis) via genes like reaper, hid, and grim. (2) In imaginal discs (epithelial primordia set aside during embryogenesis), they stimulate proliferation, eversion, and differentiation into adult structures (wings, legs, eyes, antennae). (3) In histoblasts (abdominal primordia), they drive replacement of larval epidermis. JH ABSENCE is required for metamorphosis, but ecdysone is the active trigger.",

The pre-diabetic group shows: (1) moderate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 6.8 vs. normal 1.7), and (2) compensatory hyperinsulinemia — the pancreatic β-cells are working overtime, producing very high insulin levels (fasting 25, peak 150) to overcome peripheral resistance. Despite this compensation, glucose control is impaired (fasting 110, peak 200). The Type 2 DM group shows: (1) severe insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 11.9), but critically (2) relative β-cell failure — fasting insulin is still elevated (30, reflecting residual β-cell mass), but peak insulin (80) is LOWER than the pre-diabetic group despite HIGHER glucose stimulus (310 vs 200). This indicates the β-cells can no longer mount an adequate secretory response.

The stimulus is tissue hypoxia, sensed through the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) pathway: under normal oxygen conditions, HIF-α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and ubiquitinated by VHL protein for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxia, PHDs are inactive, HIF-α accumulates, dimerizes with HIF-β, and activates EPO gene transcription. EPO enters the bloodstream and acts on EPO receptors (EpoR) on erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-E) in the bone marrow, promoting their survival, proliferation, and differentiation into mature red blood cells.

The frequency of GnRH pulses differentially regulates LH and FSH gene expression and secretion: (1) High-frequency pulses (~1 per 60-90 minutes, characteristic of the late follicular/preovulatory phase) preferentially increase LH-β subunit gene expression and LH secretion. (2) Low-frequency pulses (~1 per 2-4 hours, characteristic of the early follicular and luteal phases) preferentially increase FSH-β subunit gene expression and FSH secretion. Continuous (non-pulsatile) GnRH actually SUPPRESSES gonadotropin release by causing GnRH receptor downregulation — this is the basis for GnRH agonist therapy (e.g., leuprolide), which after an initial flare, suppresses FSH/LH.

(2) LOCALIZATION: Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization should show CRH protein and mRNA in neurons of that nucleus, demonstrating production capacity.

(2) Afferent signals travel via the spinal cord to the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. (3) Magnocellular neurons release oxytocin from the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream. (4) Oxytocin binds OT receptors on uterine smooth muscle (myometrium), stimulating contractions by increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ via Gq-PLC-IP₃ signaling. (5) Stronger contractions push the fetus further against the cervix, increasing stretch receptor activation. (6) More oxytocin is released, causing even stronger contractions.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which autoreactive T cells (primarily CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes) destroy pancreatic β-cells, guided by autoantibodies against β-cell antigens (GAD65, IA-2, insulin, ZnT8). This leads to absolute insulin deficiency, requiring lifelong exogenous insulin therapy. It typically presents in childhood/adolescence with acute hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and weight loss. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) begins with insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, adipose), initially compensated by β-cell hyperinsulinemia. Over time, the β-cells decompensate (due to glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, ER stress, amyloid deposition), leading to relative insulin deficiency. T2DM typically presents in adults with obesity, and is initially managed with lifestyle changes and oral medications. The two types differ fundamentally in pathophysiology, genetics (HLA-associated in T1DM), and treatment.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "When TBG levels rise (as during pregnancy, estrogen therapy, or hepatitis), initially more thyroid hormone is bound, transiently reducing free T4/T3. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis detects this slight free T4 decrease, transiently increases TSH, which stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4/T3 until free T4/T3 return to normal. The new steady state has: (1) elevated TOTAL T4 and T3 (because more is protein-bound), (2) NORMAL free T4 and T3 (the biologically active fraction), and (3) normal (or very slightly elevated) TSH. The patient is clinically euthyroid because it is the FREE hormone that determines biological activity. This is why modern thyroid function testing measures FREE T4 rather than total T4 — total T4 is affected by TBG changes that don't reflect actual thyroid status. Conversely, conditions that decrease TBG (androgens, nephrotic syndrome) reduce total T4 but maintain normal free T4.",

Before puberty/plate closure (gigantism): GH/IGF-1 stimulate chondrocyte proliferation in open growth plates, causing increased linear growth and proportional tall stature (some patients exceed 7-8 feet). After plate closure (acromegaly): linear bone growth is impossible, so GH/IGF-1 cause periosteal bone growth (widening of hands, feet, jaw/mandible — prognathism), soft tissue enlargement (thickened skin, macroglossia — enlarged tongue), and organomegaly (cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly). Both conditions share metabolic complications: insulin resistance/diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Both are caused by the same pathology (usually a GH-secreting pituitary somatotroph adenoma) — the difference is timing relative to skeletal maturity.

Paradoxically, adiponectin levels are INVERSELY correlated with adiposity — obese individuals have LOW adiponectin despite having more adipose tissue.

(2) AVP conditional KO in Region Z: if ACTH response is partially reduced, AVP from this region contributes. (3) Double conditional KO (both CRH and AVP deleted from Region Z): if the ACTH response is more impaired than either single KO, the two neuropeptides are non-redundant and both required.

(3) PER/CRY complexes directly inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional activity, suppressing their own transcription.

By inhibiting TPO, PTU blocks all these steps. (2) SECONDARY: PTU (but not methimazole) also inhibits peripheral type 1 deiodinase (D1), reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3.

The most likely diagnosis is a prolactinoma, the most common functional pituitary adenoma. Hyperprolactinemia suppresses GnRH pulse generator activity in the hypothalamus, reducing GnRH pulsatility. This leads to decreased LH and FSH secretion, resulting in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low estradiol, anovulation → amenorrhea). Prolactin also directly stimulates breast milk production (galactorrhea). In primary ovarian failure, FSH and LH would be elevated (not suppressed). Normal TSH rules out hypothyroidism.

      "explanation": "The specificity of hormone action depends entirely on the presence of specific receptors in/on target cells. A hormone may circulate throughout the entire body via the bloodstream, but only cells expressing the appropriate receptor will respond. This 'lock and key' specificity operates at multiple levels: (1) Receptor expression: not all cells express all hormone receptors — receptor gene expression is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. (2) Receptor affinity: receptors bind their cognate hormones with high affinity (Kd typically in the nM to pM range), ensuring specificity even at low circulating concentrations. (3) Receptor density: the number of receptors (upregulation/downregulation) modulates tissue sensitivity. (4) Post-receptor signaling: even cells with the same receptor may respond differently due to cell-type-specific expression of downstream signaling components and effectors. This principle explains how a single hormone like insulin can have different effects in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.",

Key differences: (1) Speed: Neural transmission is fast (ms, via action potentials and synaptic transmission) while hormonal signaling is slower (seconds for catecholamines, minutes to hours for steroids/thyroid hormones). (2) Duration: Neural signals are brief (ms, terminated by neurotransmitter reuptake/degradation) while hormonal effects can last minutes to days. (3) Specificity: Neurons communicate with specific postsynaptic targets via anatomical connections (synapses); hormones broadcast via blood to all tissues, with specificity determined by receptor expression. (4) Amplification: Hormones can reach millions of target cells simultaneously; neurons typically signal a limited number of postsynaptic cells. However, there is significant overlap: neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine) also act as hormones, neuropeptides can function as both, and neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus convert neural signals into hormonal outputs.",

      "explanation": "The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has a problem: it has nearly equal affinity for cortisol and aldosterone in vitro. Since cortisol circulates at 100-1000× higher concentrations than aldosterone, cortisol would saturate the MR and make aldosterone signaling impossible — unless a mechanism ensures specificity. This mechanism is 11β-HSD2, which is co-expressed with MR in aldosterone-sensitive tissues (distal nephron, colon, sweat glands). 11β-HSD2 converts cortisol (active) to cortisone (inactive at MR), effectively 'protecting' the MR from cortisol and allowing aldosterone (which is not a substrate for 11β-HSD2) to be the physiological ligand. Mutations in 11β-HSD2 cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) syndrome: cortisol activates renal MR, causing sodium retention, hypokalemia, and hypertension despite low aldosterone.

      "explanation": "D2 (type 2 deiodinase) is uniquely regulated by substrate-induced degradation. When intracellular T4 (its substrate) is high, T4 binding triggers D2 ubiquitination by the WSB-1/Cul5 E3 ligase complex, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This reduces D2 activity and T3 production. Conversely, when T4 is low, D2 is stabilized, increasing its half-life and activity, enhancing local T3 production from the limited T4 available. This creates a powerful local homeostatic mechanism that buffers intracellular T3 in the brain and pituitary against fluctuations in plasma T4. This is critical for brain function, as the brain depends on D2-generated T3 rather than plasma T3 (which crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly). D2 in the pituitary mediates the negative feedback of T4 on TSH secretion — local T3 generated by D2 binds pituitary TRβ2 receptors to suppress TSH-β gene transcription. D1, in contrast, is regulated at the transcriptional level by thyroid hormone (T3 increases D1 mRNA).",

The counter-regulatory hormones — glucagon (from pancreatic α-cells), epinephrine (from adrenal medulla), cortisol (from adrenal cortex), and growth hormone (from anterior pituitary) — activate hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to restore blood glucose. Transgenic X mice show an even greater initial drop (to 35 at 30 min) but critically FAIL TO RECOVER — glucose continues to fall (35→30→28→26→25), indicating absence of effective counter-regulatory responses. This is life-threatening hypoglycemia.

      "explanation": "Amphibian metamorphosis is one of the most dramatic thyroid hormone-dependent processes in vertebrates. Rising T3/T4 levels (regulated by TSH and the HPT axis) trigger a complex, tissue-specific developmental program in the tadpole: (1) Tail: T3 induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) via activation of caspases and matrix metalloproteinases, causing complete tail resorption. (2) Limbs: T3 promotes limb bud growth and differentiation. (3) Gills to lungs: Larval gills undergo apoptosis while lung tissue proliferates and differentiates. (4) Gut: Larval herbivorous gut (long, with typhlosole) is remodeled to a shorter adult carnivorous gut via apoptosis and stem cell proliferation. (5) Brain: Neural remodeling including optic system changes and new motor circuits for terrestrial locomotion.

(2) The activated, agonist-occupied receptor is specifically recognized and phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs, particularly GRK2/β-ARK for β-adrenergic receptors). GRKs only phosphorylate the active conformation of the receptor. (3) Phosphorylated receptor binds β-arrestin with high affinity. β-arrestin sterically blocks further G protein coupling (uncoupling). (4) β-arrestin also serves as an adaptor for clathrin and AP-2, targeting the receptor for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. (5) Internalized receptors in endosomes are either dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane (resensitization, minutes) or targeted to lysosomes for degradation (downregulation, hours).

(2) Signals travel via the accessory olfactory bulb to the medial amygdala and hypothalamus. (3) Hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons are activated, releasing dopamine into the portal system.

Produced by hypothalamic neurons, pancreatic delta cells, and GI tract D cells, SST acts through five receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5, all Gi-coupled GPCRs). Legitimate SST actions include: (A) GH inhibition — SST from the hypothalamus inhibits GH release from anterior pituitary somatotrophs (SSTR2 and SSTR5); (B) Insulin/glucagon inhibition — pancreatic delta cell SST inhibits both beta cell insulin and alpha cell glucagon secretion via paracrine signaling; (C) GI inhibition — SST inhibits gastric acid (parietal cells), pepsin (chief cells), gastrin (G cells), secretin, CCK, VIP, and pancreatic enzyme secretion. (D) FALSE — SST does NOT stimulate thyroid hormone synthesis. In fact, SST modestly INHIBITS TSH secretion.

The signaling mechanism follows the classic nuclear receptor paradigm: (1) Calcitriol enters the target cell and binds VDR in the nucleus. (2) VDR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR). (3) The VDR/RXR heterodimer binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs, typically DR3 — direct repeats spaced by 3 nucleotides) in target gene promoters.

      "explanation": "An incretin is defined as a gut-derived hormone that potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) — meaning it enhances insulin release only when glucose is elevated. The hyperglycemic clamp (maintaining blood glucose at a constant elevated level via glucose infusion) isolates the insulin secretory response from glucose variability. To test incretin activity: (1) Perform hyperglycemic clamp alone, measuring steady-state insulin secretion (baseline GSIS). (2) During a second clamp at the same glucose level, co-infuse EndoX and measure whether insulin secretion increases above baseline (incretin effect). (3) Critically, infuse EndoX at normal (euglycemic) glucose levels — if EndoX is a true incretin, it should NOT stimulate insulin release at normal glucose (glucose-dependence). This glucose-dependence distinguishes incretins from direct insulin secretagogues (like sulfonylureas). Option A shows release but not function. Option D shows a metabolic effect but doesn't prove incretin action specifically.",

(3) Autocrine: the cell responds to signals it produces itself (e.g., cancer cells secreting growth factors that stimulate their own proliferation, IL-2 from T cells stimulating T cell proliferation). A key concept is that the SAME molecule can function in multiple modes: e.g., somatostatin acts as an endocrine hormone (hypothalamus → anterior pituitary), paracrine signal (delta cells → adjacent beta/alpha cells in islets), and neurotransmitter (CNS synapses).

      "explanation": "Sheep are 'short-day breeders' — they become reproductively active in autumn when day length decreases. The mechanism involves melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland exclusively during darkness (scotophase). As days shorten in autumn, the duration of nightly melatonin secretion increases. In sheep, this prolonged melatonin signal is interpreted by the hypothalamus (specifically by kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area) as a 'breed now' signal. The extended melatonin acts on MT1 receptors in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary, regulating TSH and subsequently hypothalamic T3/T4 conversion (via DIO2/DIO3), which modulates kisspeptin and GnRH pulse generator activity. The result is increased GnRH pulsatility, LH/FSH surge, and gonadal activation. In contrast, hamsters are 'long-day breeders' — for them, the same prolonged melatonin signal SUPPRESSES the HPG axis, and they breed in summer when melatonin duration is short.",

Liver-derived IGF-1 circulates bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs, especially IGFBP-3 and the acid-labile subunit, forming a ternary complex that extends IGF-1 half-life from minutes to hours). Circulating IGF-1 mediates many systemic GH effects and provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus (increasing somatostatin) and pituitary (decreasing GH secretion). (2) Paracrine/autocrine IGF-1: GH also stimulates local IGF-1 production in many tissues (bone, muscle, cartilage), where IGF-1 acts in paracrine/autocrine fashion to promote cell proliferation and differentiation.

      "explanation": "(I) TRUE: Protein binding creates a reservoir of hormone that is protected from glomerular filtration (protein-bound complexes are too large to filter), enzymatic degradation, and hepatic clearance. T4 has a half-life of ~6-7 days largely because 99.97% is protein-bound (to TBG, transthyretin, and albumin). Free T4 has a much shorter half-life. (II) TRUE: Peptide hormones (insulin ~5 min, ACTH ~10 min, PTH ~5 min) are rapidly degraded by peptidases and cleared by the kidneys. Steroid hormones bound to proteins last longer (cortisol ~60-90 min, T4 ~7 days). Catecholamines are intermediate (1-2 min). (III) TRUE: Half-life determines the temporal dynamics of hormonal signaling. Short-lived hormones (insulin, catecholamines) allow rapid, pulsatile regulation. Long-lived hormones (T4) provide stable, slowly-changing signals. Clinical implication: after thyroidectomy, T4 levels decline slowly over weeks, while insulin levels fall within minutes of β-cell destruction.

Without CYP17A1, it cannot convert pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone or progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone — steps required for both cortisol and androgen synthesis. Instead, pregnenolone and progesterone are directed toward the mineralocorticoid pathway, ultimately producing aldosterone via 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2), 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B2), and the unique aldosterone synthase activity of CYP11B2. The zona fasciculata and reticularis DO express CYP17A1, allowing cortisol and androgen production respectively. However, only the zona glomerulosa expresses CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) while the fasciculata expresses CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase without aldosterone synthase activity).

The hallmark is: elevated calcium (12.0 mg/dL, above normal ~8.5-10.5) WITH inappropriately elevated PTH (85 pg/mL, normal ~15-65). Normally, high calcium should suppress PTH via the calcium-sensing receptor — the fact that PTH remains elevated despite hypercalcemia indicates autonomous (unregulated) PTH secretion. Low phosphate (2.0) confirms PTH excess (PTH increases renal phosphate excretion). Patient B has HYPOparathyroidism: low Ca²⁺, low PTH, high phosphate — the parathyroid glands are dysfunctional. Patient C has non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia (e.g., malignancy-associated via PTHrP, vitamin D intoxication, or granulomatous disease) — the high calcium appropriately suppresses PTH to undetectable levels.

Its advantages include: (1) Prevention of receptor desensitization: Continuous stimulation causes GRK phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding, and receptor internalization/downregulation. Pulsatile delivery allows receptors to resensitize between pulses, maintaining responsiveness. GnRH is the classic example — continuous GnRH paradoxically SUPPRESSES gonadotropins (basis for GnRH agonist therapy). (2) Frequency encoding: Different pulse frequencies can activate different downstream pathways (e.g., high-frequency GnRH favors LH, low-frequency favors FSH). This adds an information dimension beyond simple concentration. (3) Efficiency: Pulsatile delivery achieves the same biological effect with less total hormone. (4) Temporal coordination: Pulsatile release allows synchronization with circadian rhythms and metabolic cycles. Nearly all hypothalamic-pituitary hormones are pulsatile: GH (largest pulse during sleep), ACTH/cortisol (circadian), LH/FSH (ultradian), prolactin, TSH.",

(2) Increasing renal calcium excretion by inhibiting tubular Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Both effects lower blood calcium. However, calcitonin's physiological role in adult humans is considered MINOR — total thyroidectomy patients (who lose C cells) do not develop significant hypercalcemia, and calcitonin-secreting medullary thyroid carcinoma patients do not develop hypocalcemia. Its role may be more important during pregnancy/lactation and in childhood when bone turnover is high.

        "Mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR/NR3C1) reducing ligand binding affinity, increased expression of 11β-HSD2 converting cortisol to cortisone, or overexpression of GR-β (a dominant-negative splice variant that inhibits GR-α transcriptional activity)",
        "Increased adrenal cortisol production",
        "Mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor",
        "Overexpression of ACTH receptors on the adrenal cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glucocorticoid resistance can occur through several mechanisms: (1) GR gene mutations: Mutations in NR3C1 that reduce cortisol binding affinity, impair nuclear translocation, or disrupt DNA binding cause familial glucocorticoid resistance (Chrousos syndrome). Patients have elevated cortisol/ACTH but no Cushingoid features because tissues are resistant. The elevated ACTH drives adrenal androgen and mineralocorticoid excess. (2) 11β-HSD2 overexpression: In tissues where 11β-HSD2 is upregulated, cortisol is converted to inactive cortisone before it can bind GR, creating local glucocorticoid resistance. (3) GR-β splice variant: GR-β is an alternatively spliced isoform that cannot bind glucocorticoids but can form heterodimers with GR-α, acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor. GR-β overexpression is associated with steroid-resistant asthma and inflammatory diseases. (4) Other mechanisms: altered coregulator expression, increased P-glycoprotein efflux of cortisol, or post-translational modifications of GR.",

      "question": "Nematodes (C. elegans) use which hormonal system to regulate dauer formation, a stress-resistant larval state analogous to insect diapause?",
      "options": [
        "Dafachronic acids (steroid-like molecules) act through the nuclear receptor DAF-12; low dafachronic acid levels (from reduced insulin-like signaling) promote dauer formation, while high levels promote reproductive growth",
        "Ecdysone and juvenile hormone regulate dauer formation identically to insect metamorphosis",
        "C. elegans uses only neurotransmitters for developmental decisions; it has no endocrine system",
        "Vertebrate-type thyroid hormone controls dauer formation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "C. elegans dauer formation is regulated by an endocrine signaling network centered on the nuclear receptor DAF-12 and its ligands, dafachronic acids (DAs). Under favorable conditions (abundant food, low population density, moderate temperature): (1) Insulin-like signaling (via DAF-2 receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway) is active, which promotes DA biosynthesis. (2) DAs bind DAF-12, which then acts as a transcriptional activator promoting reproductive development genes. Under unfavorable conditions: (1) Reduced insulin signaling activates DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor (longevity pathway). (2) DA production decreases. (3) Unliganded DAF-12, in complex with the corepressor DIN-1, represses reproductive programs and activates dauer-specific genes. Dauer pheromones (ascarosides — small molecules secreted at high population density) also feed into this decision through chemosensory neurons. This is analogous but not homologous to insect ecdysone/JH signaling. Interestingly, the insulin/IGF pathway's role in longevity discovered in C. elegans has parallels in mammals.",

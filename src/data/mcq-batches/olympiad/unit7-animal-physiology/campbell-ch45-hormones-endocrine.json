      "options": [
        "They activate membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate cytoplasmic targets",
        "They bind intracellular nuclear receptors, forming hormone-receptor complexes that act as transcription factors by binding to hormone response elements (HREs) in DNA",
        "They directly phosphorylate transcription factors in the cytoplasm without entering the nucleus",
        "They activate G-protein-coupled receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, estradiol, testosterone, progesterone) are lipophilic molecules that freely cross the plasma membrane. Inside the cell, they bind to intracellular nuclear receptors (which may be located in the cytoplasm or already in the nucleus, depending on the receptor type). The hormone-receptor complex undergoes conformational change, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus (if cytoplasmic), where it binds specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. Acting as ligand-activated transcription factors, they recruit coactivators or corepressors to modulate gene transcription. This genomic mechanism explains the relatively slow onset (hours) but prolonged duration of steroid hormone effects compared to peptide hormones that act via surface receptors.",

      "options": [
        "TRH from the hypothalamus stimulates TSH release from the anterior pituitary; TSH stimulates T3/T4 release from the thyroid; elevated T3/T4 inhibit both TRH and TSH secretion",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The HPT axis follows the classic three-tier hierarchical pattern. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) into the hypophyseal portal system. TRH stimulates thyrotroph cells in the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, or thyrotropin). TSH travels through the systemic circulation to the thyroid gland, where it binds TSH receptors (Gs-coupled GPCRs) on follicular cells, stimulating synthesis and release of thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine, the predominant product) and T3 (triiodothyronine, more active). Elevated circulating T3/T4 exert negative feedback at two levels: (1) inhibiting TRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and (2) directly inhibiting TSH release from anterior pituitary thyrotrophs. Most T3 is produced by peripheral deiodination of T4 by type 1 and type 2 deiodinases.",

      "explanation": "(I) TRUE: The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric (α₂β₂) receptor tyrosine kinase. Insulin binding to the α subunits causes conformational change and trans-autophosphorylation of the β subunits on specific tyrosine residues, creating docking sites for IRS-1 and IRS-2. (II) TRUE: IRS phosphorylation activates PI3K, generating PIP₃, which activates PDK1 and subsequently Akt (protein kinase B). Akt phosphorylates AS160 (TBC1D4), promoting GLUT4-containing vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. This dramatically increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. (III) TRUE: Akt phosphorylates and INACTIVATES GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), which normally phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase. Thus insulin indirectly activates glycogen synthase, promoting glycogen storage. (IV) FALSE: Neurons use GLUT1 and GLUT3, and red blood cells use GLUT1 — these transporters are constitutively expressed and insulin-independent. Brain and RBCs take up glucose regardless of insulin levels.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The adrenal medulla is a modified sympathetic ganglion that produces catecholamines — approximately 80% epinephrine and 20% norepinephrine. Pheochromocytoma causes paroxysmal (episodic) or sustained overproduction of catecholamines, leading to the classic triad: episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia, along with severe hypertension. The hypertension results from α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction (norepinephrine) and cardiac stimulation via β1 receptors (epinephrine). Episodes can be triggered by physical activity, stress, or certain foods. Option A describes adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), option C describes Cushing's syndrome (cortisol excess), and option D describes hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease). Diagnosis involves measuring urinary catecholamines and their metabolites (metanephrines, VMA). Treatment is surgical resection after α-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) followed by β-blockade.",

This constellation — primary hypothyroidism with high anti-TPO antibodies — is pathognomonic for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions. In Graves' disease, T3/T4 would be elevated with suppressed TSH. In secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary failure), TSH would be low or inappropriately normal despite low T4/T3, and anti-TPO would be negative. In thyroid hormone resistance, T4/T3 are elevated with non-suppressed TSH due to mutant thyroid hormone receptors.",

      "options": [
        "PTH directly stimulates osteoblasts to deposit calcium into the blood from bone",
        "PTH stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (indirectly via RANKL), increases renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal tubule, and promotes calcitriol (1,25-(OH)₂D₃) synthesis to enhance intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "PTH raises blood calcium through three coordinated mechanisms at three target organs: (1) Bone: PTH binds PTH1R receptors on osteoBLASTS (not osteoclasts directly), stimulating them to produce RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand). RANKL binds RANK on osteoclast precursors, promoting their differentiation into mature osteoclasts that resorb bone, releasing Ca²⁺ and phosphate. OPG (osteoprotegerin), a decoy receptor for RANKL, is simultaneously downregulated. (2) Kidney: PTH increases Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (via TRPV5 channels and calbindin) while decreasing phosphate reabsorption proximally (via NaPi-IIa internalization). PTH also activates 1α-hydroxylase, converting 25-(OH)D₃ to active 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol). (3) Intestine: Calcitriol increases intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption via TRPV6 channels and calbindin-D9k — an indirect PTH effect.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "To rigorously demonstrate hormone function, the classical criteria (analogous to Koch's postulates for hormones) require: (1) Identification of the source: the peptide must be produced by specific endocrine cells and released into the bloodstream. (2) Regulated secretion: blood levels should change in response to physiological stimuli (here, food intake). (3) Target tissue with specific receptor: a receptor for the peptide must be identified in a distant target tissue, distinguishing hormonal from paracrine/autocrine action. (4) Biological effect: injection of purified peptide should reproduce the observed physiological response. (5) Specificity: a receptor antagonist or antibody should block the effect. Option B is necessary but insufficient — mere presence in blood doesn't prove function. Option C would identify a neurotransmitter, not a hormone. Option D is flawed because compensation/redundancy might mask the phenotype.",

      "explanation": "Growth hormone secretion is under dual hypothalamic control: (1) Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus, stimulates GH release from somatotroph cells via Gs-coupled GHRH receptors that increase cAMP. (2) Somatostatin (SS, also called growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, GHIH), produced by periventricular neurons, inhibits GH release via Gi-coupled SST receptors that decrease cAMP. GH secretion is pulsatile, with the largest pulses during slow-wave sleep, resulting from alternating GHRH stimulation and somatostatin withdrawal. Additionally, ghrelin (from the stomach) stimulates GH release via the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Negative feedback operates at multiple levels: GH inhibits its own secretion by stimulating somatostatin release and inhibiting GHRH, while IGF-1 (produced by the liver in response to GH) also suppresses GH at both hypothalamic and pituitary levels.",

      "explanation": "The epinephrine signaling cascade is a textbook example of signal amplification through an enzymatic cascade. Each step amplifies the signal: (1) One epinephrine molecule activates one β-adrenergic receptor → (2) One receptor activates multiple Gs proteins (amplification ~10×) → (3) Each Gs activates one adenylyl cyclase, which produces many cAMP molecules (~100×) → (4) Each cAMP activates PKA, and each PKA phosphorylates many phosphorylase kinase molecules (~10×) → (5) Each phosphorylase kinase activates many glycogen phosphorylase molecules (~10×) → (6) Each phosphorylase cleaves many glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen (~100×). The multiplicative effect through 5+ enzymatic steps yields approximately 10⁸ glucose molecules from one hormone-receptor binding event.

ACTH from anterior pituitary corticotrophs is the primary regulator, acting through MC2R (melanocortin 2 receptor) to stimulate steroidogenesis via the StAR protein and steroidogenic enzymes. (III) TRUE: The inner zona reticularis produces weak androgens (DHEA, DHEA-S, androstenedione), regulated by ACTH.

Ecdysone (produced by the prothoracic gland, stimulated by PTTH from the brain) triggers each molt by activating the nuclear receptor EcR/USP heterodimer, inducing genes for cuticle synthesis and apolysis. JH (produced by the corpora allata) determines the QUALITY of the molt: (1) High JH + ecdysone → larva-to-larva molt (maintains larval gene expression programs). (2) Low JH + ecdysone → larva-to-pupa molt in holometabolous insects, or nymph-to-adult molt in hemimetabolous insects. (3) Absence of JH + ecdysone → pupa-to-adult molt (metamorphosis). JH maintains the 'status quo' — it is a 'juvenilizing' hormone. Its gradual decline during larval development, controlled by JH esterase and JH epoxide hydrolase degradation, permits progressive developmental transitions.

Crucially, their fasting insulin is ELEVATED, indicating the pancreas is producing insulin but tissues are not responding — this is the hallmark of insulin resistance / type 2 diabetes. The hyperinsulinemia represents compensatory β-cell hypersecretion. Group Y has normal fasting glucose (85) but delayed glucose clearance (peak 250, returns near normal at 120). Their very LOW fasting insulin indicates insulin deficiency — consistent with early type 1 diabetes (autoimmune β-cell destruction) or a model thereof.

The posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis — pars nervosa, infundibular stalk, and median eminence) derives from the infundibulum, a downward extension of the neuroectoderm from the floor of the diencephalon (hypothalamus). During development, Rathke's pouch migrates upward and loses its connection to the oral cavity, while the infundibulum grows downward. They meet and fuse to form the mature pituitary. This dual origin explains why the anterior pituitary is a true endocrine gland (epithelial cells producing hormones) while the posterior pituitary is neural tissue (storing and releasing hypothalamic hormones).",

      "explanation": "In Addison's disease, the adrenal cortex is destroyed (commonly by autoimmune adrenalitis, tuberculosis, or other causes), leading to deficiency of ALL adrenal cortical hormones: cortisol (glucocorticoid), aldosterone (mineralocorticoid), and adrenal androgens. Due to loss of negative feedback from cortisol, ACTH levels rise dramatically. Importantly, ACTH is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which also produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Elevated POMC processing leads to increased α-MSH, causing characteristic skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation — a hallmark sign of primary adrenal insufficiency. In secondary adrenal insufficiency (pituitary ACTH deficiency), cortisol is low but ACTH is also low, aldosterone is relatively preserved (since its regulation depends primarily on RAAS and K⁺, not ACTH), and hyperpigmentation is absent.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The parabiosis experiment between ob/ob and wild-type mice is one of the most elegant experiments in endocrinology history (Coleman, 1973). When circulatory systems are surgically joined, the ob/ob mouse (which lacks leptin) receives leptin from the wild-type partner via the shared circulation. If the hypothesis is correct, the ob/ob mouse should reduce food intake and lose weight — which is exactly what happened. The reciprocal experiment with db/db mice (which produce leptin but lack its receptor) showed that db/db mice did NOT respond to parabiosis with wild-type mice, confirming the receptor defect. Injecting recombinant leptin directly into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice specifically demonstrates the site of action. Diet restriction (option A) would cause weight loss regardless of leptin. Measuring ob gene mRNA (option D) would show it's mutated but doesn't test function.",

        "Unliganded TR is degraded by the proteasome and only stabilized when T3 binds",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Thyroid hormone receptors (TRα and TRβ) are unusual among nuclear receptors because they constitutively occupy thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA even in the absence of ligand (T3). In the unliganded state, TR/RXR heterodimers recruit corepressor complexes (NCoR — nuclear receptor corepressor, and SMRT — silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors), which in turn recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs condense chromatin and actively REPRESS transcription of target genes below basal levels. When T3 binds, conformational change in TR causes release of corepressors and recruitment of coactivator complexes (SRC/p160 family), which recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that open chromatin and activate transcription. This 'derepression plus activation' model explains why hypothyroidism causes more severe effects than simply lacking a hormone — the unliganded receptor actively represses genes that would otherwise be transcribed at basal levels.",

They contain at least four endocrine cell types: (1) Beta cells (~65-80% of islet mass) produce INSULIN, released when blood glucose rises above ~100 mg/dL. Insulin promotes glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis. (2) Alpha cells (~15-20%) produce GLUCAGON, released when blood glucose falls. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. (3) Delta cells (~3-10%) produce SOMATOSTATIN, which inhibits both insulin and glucagon secretion via paracrine signaling — acting as a local brake on islet hormone release. (4) PP cells (~1%) produce pancreatic polypeptide, which inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion. Additionally, epsilon cells produce ghrelin.

Neurons in hypothalamic nuclei (arcuate, paraventricular, etc.) release their hormones (TRH, GnRH, CRH, GHRH, somatostatin, dopamine) into fenestrated capillaries of the primary capillary plexus in the median eminence. These capillaries drain into portal veins that descend along the pituitary stalk to a secondary capillary plexus in the anterior pituitary. (II) TRUE: This portal arrangement delivers hypothalamic hormones directly to their pituitary target cells at concentrations 100-1000× higher than systemic levels. (III) FALSE: Oxytocin and ADH are produced by magnocellular neurons and transported via axons directly to the POSTERIOR pituitary for storage and release into the systemic circulation. They do NOT travel through the portal system. (IV) TRUE: Since most hypothalamic hormones are stimulatory (TRH, GnRH, CRH, GHRH), stalk transection reduces anterior pituitary hormone secretion.

Hyperpigmentation is NOT a typical feature of Cushing's syndrome — it occurs in Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) where ACTH is elevated. In most Cushing's syndrome cases, the cause is either exogenous glucocorticoids (ACTH is suppressed) or a pituitary adenoma (ACTH is elevated but usually not enough for significant hyperpigmentation).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a class C GPCR that couples primarily to Gq/G11 and Gi/o proteins. When extracellular Ca²⁺ rises, Ca²⁺ ions bind CaSR on parathyroid chief cells, activating PLC-IP₃-DAG signaling, which inhibits PTH secretion. This creates the negative feedback loop: high Ca²⁺ → CaSR activation → decreased PTH → decreased blood Ca²⁺. Activating (gain-of-function) mutations in CaSR make the receptor hypersensitive to calcium, so it signals 'calcium is high' even at normal Ca²⁺ levels, suppressing PTH and causing autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH). Patients present with hypocalcemia, low PTH, and relative hypercalciuria. Conversely, inactivating (loss-of-function) mutations make the receptor insensitive to calcium, requiring higher Ca²⁺ to suppress PTH, causing familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) — asymptomatic mild hypercalcemia with low urinary calcium.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Normal cortisol secretion follows a circadian (diurnal) pattern driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus: highest in the early morning (~15-25 μg/dL at 8 AM, the 'cortisol awakening response'), declining throughout the day, with a nadir at midnight (~1-5 μg/dL). The healthy subject shows this classic pattern (18→3). The patient shows: (1) elevated cortisol at all time points, (2) LOSS of normal diurnal variation (only modest decline from 35 to 28), and (3) failure to suppress with low-dose dexamethasone. Loss of diurnal variation is one of the earliest features of Cushing's syndrome, often preceding overt hypercortisolism. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that should suppress ACTH and cortisol via negative feedback — failure to suppress confirms autonomous cortisol production. The next diagnostic step would be high-dose dexamethasone suppression and ACTH measurement to distinguish pituitary, adrenal, and ectopic sources.",

However, the first COMMITTED step toward prostaglandins specifically is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX, also called prostaglandin H₂ synthase). COX converts AA to prostaglandin G₂ (via cyclooxygenase activity) and then to prostaglandin H₂ (via peroxidase activity). PGH₂ is then converted by tissue-specific synthases to various prostaglandins (PGE₂, PGD₂, PGF₂α, PGI₂/prostacyclin) and thromboxane A₂. Two major COX isoforms exist: COX-1 (constitutive, housekeeping functions) and COX-2 (inducible by inflammation). NSAIDs inhibit COX: aspirin irreversibly acetylates COX (explaining its antiplatelet effect — platelets cannot synthesize new COX), while ibuprofen and naproxen reversibly compete with AA.

Positive staining would indicate production and storage of the factor. (2) Arteriovenous (A-V) concentration differences across candidate organs during exercise would definitively identify which organ RELEASES Factor X into the circulation. If venous blood leaving an organ has higher Factor X concentration than arterial blood entering it, that organ is secreting Factor X. This technique was classically used to identify the liver as the source of angiotensinogen and adipose tissue as the source of leptin. Option A shows Factor X rises but doesn't identify the source.

The rate-limiting enzyme is AANAT (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase), which is dramatically upregulated at night. The regulation pathway is: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, the master circadian clock) → paraventricular nucleus → intermediolateral column of spinal cord → superior cervical ganglion → postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine → β1-adrenergic receptors on pinealocytes → cAMP → PKA → AANAT activation and stabilization. Light detected by retinal photoreceptors (melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs) signals the SCN, which INHIBITS the sympathetic pathway during daytime. Thus melatonin is high at night (darkness) and low during the day. Melatonin acts on MT1 and MT2 receptors in the SCN and other brain regions to entrain circadian rhythms.",

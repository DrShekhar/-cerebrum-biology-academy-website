        "Lipids are the only macromolecules that are soluble in water"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Unlike carbohydrates (polymers of monosaccharides), proteins (polymers of amino acids), and nucleic acids (polymers of nucleotides), lipids are a chemically diverse group defined by their hydrophobic nature rather than by a common monomeric structure. While fats are built from glycerol and fatty acids, these components are not identical repeating units. Phospholipids, steroids, and waxes have very different structures. The unifying feature is hydrophobicity (low water solubility). Option A is wrong because all macromolecules contain carbon. Option B is wrong because proteins and nucleic acids are typically much larger. Option D is wrong because lipids are hydrophobic and poorly soluble in water.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The stereochemistry of the glycosidic bond (\u03b1 vs \u03b2 at the anomeric carbon) has profound structural consequences. In starch (amylose), \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bonds place each glucose rotated ~60\u00b0 relative to the next, creating a helical coil. This structure is readily accessible to \u03b1-amylase and other digestive enzymes. In cellulose, \u03b2-1,4 bonds flip alternating glucose residues 180\u00b0, creating straight, extended chains. Adjacent chains form extensive interchain hydrogen bonds, assembling into rigid microfibrils with tensile strength comparable to steel. Most animals lack cellulase enzymes to hydrolyze \u03b2-1,4 bonds \u2014 only symbionts (termite gut bacteria, ruminant microflora) can digest cellulose. This single stereochemical difference (\u03b1 vs \u03b2 at C-1) determines whether a polysaccharide serves as energy storage (starch, glycogen) or structural support (cellulose, chitin). Option A is wrong \u2014 branching depends on \u03b1-1,6 linkages. Option C is wrong \u2014 both have similar bond energies. Option D is wrong.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Phospholipid bilayer self-assembly is a spontaneous process driven by the hydrophobic effect. When amphipathic phospholipids are added to water, their hydrophobic tails disrupt water's hydrogen bonding network, forcing water molecules into highly ordered 'clathrate' structures. Bilayer formation buries the hydrophobic tails away from water, releasing these ordered water molecules and increasing their entropy \u2014 this entropic gain is the primary thermodynamic driving force (T\u0394S term). The hydrophilic head groups face the aqueous phase, forming favorable electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The process is spontaneous (negative \u0394G) and requires no energy input. The resulting liposomes are thermodynamically stable and kinetically accessible. Option A is wrong because it minimizes free energy, not maximizes total energy. Option B is wrong because no covalent bonds form between lipids. Option D is wrong because no ATP is needed.",

      "explanation": "Christian Anfinsen's 1972 Nobel Prize-winning experiment with ribonuclease A (RNase A, 124 amino acids, 4 disulfide bonds) provided definitive evidence that the amino acid sequence contains all information necessary for protein folding. He denatured RNase A with urea (breaking non-covalent interactions) and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (reducing the 4 disulfide bonds), destroying enzymatic activity. When he removed both agents and allowed the protein to refold in an oxidizing environment, the protein spontaneously recovered ~100% of its native enzymatic activity \u2014 meaning it found the one correct native fold out of 10^39 possible random configurations. When he removed urea first but kept the disulfide bonds scrambled, only ~1% activity was recovered, but addition of trace \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (allowing disulfide reshuffling) restored full activity.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Watson-Crick base pairing involves specific hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs: adenine forms 2 hydrogen bonds with thymine (or uracil in RNA), and guanine forms 3 hydrogen bonds with cytosine. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the pairing rules are enforced by geometric (steric) complementarity: the double helix has a uniform diameter of 2 nm (20 \u00c5) because a purine (two-ring, ~1.2 nm wide) always pairs with a pyrimidine (one-ring, ~0.8 nm wide). A purine-purine pair would be too wide, and a pyrimidine-pyrimidine pair too narrow. The additional G-C hydrogen bond makes GC-rich regions more thermally stable (higher melting temperature). Base stacking interactions (van der Waals and hydrophobic) between adjacent base pairs also contribute significantly to duplex stability. Option A is wrong \u2014 base pairing uses non-covalent hydrogen bonds. Option B is wrong \u2014 backbone interactions don't determine base pairing specificity.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Saturated fatty acids have no C=C double bonds, allowing their hydrocarbon chains to adopt an extended, all-trans conformation that packs tightly with neighboring chains through extensive van der Waals (London dispersion) interactions. This tight packing creates ordered, rigid membranes with higher melting points. Unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more cis C=C double bonds, each introducing a ~30\u00b0 bend that disrupts the regular packing arrangement. This prevents neighboring chains from aligning closely, creating more space and disorder \u2014 increasing membrane fluidity. At physiological temperatures, a higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids increases fluidity. Organisms regulate membrane fluidity through fatty acid desaturases and by incorporating cholesterol (which moderates fluidity in both directions). Option A reverses the structures. Option C is wrong \u2014 their effects are opposite. Option D is an incorrect generalization.",

        "If a protein explored all possible conformations randomly (sampling one per picosecond), a 100-residue protein would require ~10^87 years \u2014 yet real proteins fold in milliseconds to seconds, indicating that folding follows a directed pathway through a funnel-shaped energy landscape rather than a random search",

        "All proteins fold into the same shape regardless of their amino acid sequence",
        "Protein folding violates the second law of thermodynamics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cyrus Levinthal calculated that a protein of 100 residues, with each residue having approximately 3 possible backbone conformations (\u03c6, \u03c8 angles), would have ~3^100 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10^47 possible conformations. Sampling each for 10^-13 seconds (molecular vibration timescale) would require ~5 \u00d7 10^34 seconds (>10^27 years) \u2014 far longer than the age of the universe. Yet proteins fold in microseconds to seconds. This paradox implies that proteins do NOT search conformational space randomly. Modern understanding views folding as descent through a funnel-shaped energy landscape: local interactions form rapidly (secondary structure nucleation), guiding the protein toward progressively lower energy states through a limited set of pathways. Hydrophobic collapse, nucleation-condensation, and framework models all describe aspects of this directed process. Option B is the opposite \u2014 proteins fold remarkably fast. Option C contradicts amino acid sequence specificity. Option D is wrong \u2014 folding doesn't violate thermodynamics.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Both glycogen and amylopectin use \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bonds for the main chain and \u03b1-1,6 bonds at branch points. The key difference is branching frequency: glycogen branches every 8-12 glucose residues, while amylopectin branches every 24-30 residues. This means glycogen is much more highly branched, creating a dense, spherical molecule (glycogen granules, 10-40 nm diameter) with numerous non-reducing ends. Each non-reducing end is a substrate for glycogen phosphorylase, so a single glycogen granule can be simultaneously attacked by many phosphorylase enzymes, enabling extremely rapid glucose mobilization (essential during intense exercise or fight-or-flight response). Glycogen is found in animal liver and muscle, while amylopectin is found in plants alongside amylose (linear). Option A is wrong \u2014 both use \u03b1-1,4 linkages.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cholesterol's amphipathic structure (small polar hydroxyl head, rigid 4-ring steroid body, flexible hydrocarbon tail) allows it to intercalate between phospholipids. At normal body temperature (37\u00b0C), the rigid steroid rings restrict the motion of the immediately adjacent phospholipid acyl chains, reducing membrane fluidity and making the membrane less permeable to small water-soluble molecules. At low temperatures, when saturated phospholipids would otherwise pack tightly into an ordered gel phase, cholesterol's bulky ring system physically disrupts this regular packing, preventing solidification and maintaining some fluidity. This dual action makes cholesterol a 'fluidity buffer' that maintains membrane properties across a range of temperatures. Cholesterol also increases membrane mechanical strength and reduces permeability to ions and polar molecules. Cholesterol comprises ~25-50% of membrane lipids in animal cells. Option A is wrong. Option C is wrong \u2014 cholesterol is found in both leaflets. Option B oversimplifies.",

The helix has a dipole moment (N-terminus positive, C-terminus negative) due to the aligned C=O groups. Side chains project outward from the helix axis, and their properties determine helix-helix packing (hydrophobic residues in membrane helices, amphipathic helices at protein surfaces).

This intermolecular interaction drives the formation of long, stiff fibers (14 HbS strands twisted into a rope-like polymer). These fibers distort the red blood cell into the characteristic sickle shape, causing vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and tissue ischemia.

The GroEL/GroES (Hsp60) system in bacteria works as follows: (1) An unfolded or misfolded polypeptide binds to the hydrophobic interior of the GroEL ring (apical domains); (2) GroES caps the ring, creating an isolated chamber that is now hydrophilic; (3) Inside this 'Anfinsen cage,' the protein attempts to fold without the risk of aggregating with other hydrophobic proteins; (4) After ~10 seconds, ATP hydrolysis triggers GroES release and substrate ejection. If the protein is not yet folded, it can rebind for another round. Hsp70 chaperones work differently, binding and releasing short hydrophobic segments to prevent premature aggregation. Chaperones reduce the kinetic barriers to folding without altering the thermodynamic minimum. Option A is wrong per Anfinsen's principle. Option B describes ribosomes. Option D is wrong.",

This straight geometry allows tight packing in cell membranes, increasing rigidity. Trans fats affect cardiovascular health through multiple mechanisms: (1) They increase plasma LDL ('bad' cholesterol) levels by upregulating hepatic CETP activity and decreasing LDL receptor expression; (2) They decrease HDL ('good' cholesterol); (3) They promote endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide production; (4) They increase inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CRP); (5) They may promote insulin resistance.

Parallel sheets usually require distant segments of the chain to align, often with a crossover connection. Both types are common in nature: antiparallel sheets are found in silk fibroin and immunoglobulin domains, while parallel sheets are found in \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel enzymes. Option B is wrong.

      "explanation": "Three structural differences distinguish RNA from DNA: (1) Sugar: RNA contains ribose (with a 2'-hydroxyl group), while DNA contains 2'-deoxyribose (lacking the 2'-OH). The 2'-OH in RNA makes it more susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis and gives RNA molecules a preference for A-form helical geometry. (2) Base: RNA contains uracil (U) in place of thymine (T). Uracil lacks the C-5 methyl group present on thymine; this methyl group in DNA helps the mismatch repair system distinguish U (from cytosine deamination damage) from T (a correct base). (3) Strandedness: DNA is typically double-stranded, while RNA is typically single-stranded but folds into complex secondary structures (hairpins, stem-loops, pseudoknots, bulges) and tertiary structures (ribozymes, riboswitches, rRNA).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The iodine number quantifies the degree of unsaturation: I\u2082 adds across C=C double bonds (halogenation), so more double bonds = more I\u2082 absorbed = higher iodine number. The data clearly shows an inverse relationship between iodine number and melting point/physical state.

Olive oil (80-88) is rich in oleic acid (18:1 cis-\u03949), a monounsaturated fat \u2014 liquid at 25\u00b0C. Linseed oil (170-204) is rich in \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3 \u03c9-3), a highly polyunsaturated fat \u2014 very fluid liquid. Each cis double bond introduces a ~30\u00b0 kink that disrupts chain packing, lowering the melting point.

This switch-like behavior is ideal for metabolic regulation: metabolic pathways can be rapidly turned 'on' or 'off' by relatively small changes in metabolite concentration. For example, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, shows sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose-6-phosphate and is allosterically activated by AMP/ADP and inhibited by ATP/citrate. This allows glycolysis to respond sensitively to cellular energy status. The K\u2080.\u2085 (equivalent of Km for allosteric enzymes) replaces Km. Option A contradicts sigmoidal behavior.

      "explanation": "Fat yields ~9 kcal/g versus ~4 kcal/g for carbohydrate upon complete oxidation, for two fundamental chemical reasons. First, fat carbons are more reduced: in palmitate (C\u2081\u2086H\u2083\u2082O\u2082), the average carbon oxidation state is approximately -2, while in glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), it is 0. More reduced carbons have more electrons to donate to the electron transport chain upon oxidation to CO\u2082. Second, fats are nearly anhydrous in adipose tissue, while glycogen is hydrated (binding ~2g water per gram of glycogen). This means the effective energy density of glycogen in vivo is only ~1 kcal/g (4 kcal/g \u00f7 3 g total weight per g glycogen). The combined effect makes fat ~9\u00d7 more energy-dense than hydrated glycogen per unit mass, explaining why fat is the preferred long-term energy storage form. A 70 kg human stores ~135,000 kcal as fat but only ~600 kcal as glycogen. Option B reverses the comparison. Option C is incorrect. Option D is wrong.",

Z-DNA has 12 base pairs per turn (vs 10 for B-DNA), a narrower and more elongated helix (18 \u00c5 diameter vs 20 \u00c5 for B-DNA), and essentially no major groove (it is very shallow). Z-DNA formation is favored by alternating dCG sequences, high salt (> 2.5 M NaCl), cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine), and negative supercoiling. Biological relevance: Z-DNA-specific binding proteins (Z\u03b1 domain) exist; Z-DNA may form at actively transcribed gene promoters due to negative supercoiling generated behind the advancing RNA polymerase.

Cellulose microfibrils (bundles of ~36 parallel \u03b2-1,4-glucan chains held by hydrogen bonds) provide extraordinary tensile strength (~130 GPa Young's modulus, comparable to Kevlar). These microfibrils are embedded in a matrix of: (1) hemicelluloses (branched polysaccharides like xyloglucan that hydrogen-bond to cellulose surfaces, cross-linking microfibrils); (2) pectins (negatively charged polysaccharides like homogalacturonan that form hydrated gels, providing resistance to compression); (3) in secondary cell walls, lignin (a phenylpropanoid polymer that provides additional rigidity and water resistance). This fiber-matrix architecture functions like reinforced concrete: cellulose = steel rebar (tensile resistance), matrix = concrete (compression resistance). The orientation of cellulose microfibrils determines the direction of cell expansion (cells elongate perpendicular to microfibril orientation). Option B is wrong. Option C is wrong.

Amylose is essentially unbranched (very rare \u03b1-1,6 branch points), consisting of \u03b1-1,4-linked glucose residues. The helical shape of amylose (6 glucose units per turn with a hydrophobic interior) can trap iodine molecules (I\u2083\u207b and I\u2085\u207b polyiodide chains) within its coil, producing the characteristic blue-black color of the starch-iodine test.

      "explanation": "The energy landscape theory (Ken Dill, Peter Wolynes, Jose Onuchic) revolutionized understanding of protein folding. Rather than a single defined pathway (old view), proteins fold through a funnel-shaped energy landscape. The top of the funnel is broad, representing the vast conformational space of unfolded states (high entropy, high energy). As the protein folds, it descends the funnel through progressively more native-like states \u2014 entropy decreases (fewer conformations) while enthalpy decreases (more native contacts formed). The native state sits at the bottom of the funnel (minimal energy, minimal entropy). The funnel is 'rough' with local energy minima that can temporarily trap the protein (kinetic traps = misfolded intermediates). Different protein molecules can take different paths down the funnel (multiple folding routes), converging on the same native state. This explains Levinthal's paradox: the funnel biases the search, and most of conformational space is never explored. Option A contradicts the concept. Option C is the old pathway view.

The reaction contains: (1) a single-stranded DNA template; (2) a primer; (3) DNA polymerase; (4) normal dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP); (5) a small proportion of fluorescently labeled ddNTPs (ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP, each with a different fluorescent dye). The 2',3'-dideoxyribose in ddNTPs lacks the 3'-OH group, so when a ddNTP is incorporated instead of the corresponding dNTP, chain elongation terminates. Because ddNTP incorporation is random and competitive, the reaction produces fragments of every possible length, each terminated with a fluorescent ddNTP that identifies the last base. Capillary gel electrophoresis separates these fragments by size (single-nucleotide resolution), and a laser detector reads the fluorescent labels as fragments pass, generating a chromatogram (sequence trace). Option A describes the Maxam-Gilbert method. Option B describes nanopore sequencing. Option D describes microarray hybridization.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Phospholipases are classified by their cleavage specificity: PLA\u2081 cleaves the sn-1 ester bond (releasing the saturated fatty acid); PLA\u2082 cleaves the sn-2 ester bond (releasing the unsaturated fatty acid, often arachidonic acid); PLC cleaves the phosphodiester bond on the glycerol side (releasing diacylglycerol and the phospho-head group); PLD cleaves the phosphodiester bond on the head group side (releasing the head group and phosphatidic acid). PLA\u2082 is particularly important in inflammation: (1) it releases arachidonic acid (20:4 \u03c9-6) from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids; (2) arachidonic acid is then metabolized by COX (\u2192 prostaglandins, thromboxanes) and LOX (\u2192 leukotrienes); (3) the lysophospholipid product can be further converted to platelet-activating factor (PAF).

Disulfide bonds (covalent) may or may not be broken depending on conditions. S2 is TRUE: Thermal denaturation occurs because increasing temperature increases molecular kinetic energy. Above the melting temperature (Tm), the thermal energy exceeds the stabilizing energy of non-covalent interactions, and the protein unfolds. S3 is TRUE: Extreme pH changes the protonation state of ionizable groups (Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Arg, Cys, Tyr), disrupting salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that stabilize the fold. Very low pH protonates carboxylate groups (destroying Asp-/Glu- to Lys+/Arg+ salt bridges). Very high pH deprotonates ammonium groups. S4 is FALSE: While some small proteins (e.g., ribonuclease A) can refold spontaneously in vitro, many proteins aggregate irreversibly upon denaturation. Large, multi-domain proteins, membrane proteins, and proteins that require chaperones for initial folding often cannot refold spontaneously. Cooking an egg is irreversible denaturation.",

This is characteristic of pepsin, the major gastric protease. Pepsin is an aspartyl protease with two catalytic aspartate residues (Asp32 and Asp215). At pH 2.0, one Asp is protonated (acts as general acid) and the other is deprotonated (acts as general base), enabling the catalytic mechanism. As pH rises above 3.0, both Asp residues become deprotonated and catalysis is impaired. Pepsin is also irreversibly denatured above pH 6.0. This extreme acid optimum makes pepsin perfectly adapted to the stomach environment (pH 1.5-3.5). Pepsin is synthesized as pepsinogen (zymogen) and activated by autocatalytic cleavage at low pH.

Uncompetitive inhibition (II-P): The inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex, not to free enzyme. This decreases both apparent Km and Vmax by the same factor (1 + [I]/Ki'). Lithium inhibition of inositol monophosphatase is a clinical example. Non-competitive inhibition (III-S): The inhibitor binds both free enzyme and ES complex with equal affinity. Vmax decreases but Km remains unchanged because substrate binding is unaffected. Heavy metal ions often act as non-competitive inhibitors.

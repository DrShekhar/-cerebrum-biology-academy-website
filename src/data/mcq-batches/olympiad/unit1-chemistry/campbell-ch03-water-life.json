      "question": "The high specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J/g\u00b0C) is primarily due to:",
      "options": [
        "The large amount of energy required to break hydrogen bonds before the kinetic energy of water molecules can increase",
        "Water's low molecular weight compared to other solvents",
        "Water's ability to form covalent bonds with dissolved solutes",
        "The high density of water relative to other liquids"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Water's high specific heat capacity results from its extensive hydrogen bonding network. When heat is added to water, much of the energy goes into breaking hydrogen bonds rather than increasing the kinetic energy (temperature) of the molecules. Since water can form up to 4 hydrogen bonds per molecule, a large amount of energy is absorbed before temperature rises significantly. This property makes water an excellent thermal buffer for organisms and environments. Option B is incorrect because molecular weight alone does not determine specific heat. Option C is wrong because water forms noncovalent interactions, not covalent bonds, with most solutes. Option D is incorrect because density is a different physical property unrelated to specific heat capacity.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "pH = -log[H\u207a], so at pH 3, [H\u207a] = 10\u207b\u00b3 M (0.001 M). At pH 5, [H\u207a] = 10\u207b\u2075 M. The ratio is 10\u207b\u00b3/10\u207b\u2075 = 10\u00b2 = 100. Therefore, a pH 3 solution is 100 times more acidic (has 100\u00d7 more H\u207a ions) than a pH 5 solution. Each pH unit represents a 10-fold change in [H\u207a], so a 2-unit difference represents 10\u00b2 = 100-fold. Option B incorrectly states only 2 times (confusing the pH difference with the concentration ratio). Option C incorrectly equates pH directly with molarity. Option D incorrectly gives an impossibly high concentration and wrong ratio.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "A buffer is most effective (has maximum buffering capacity) when pH = pKa, which occurs when [A\u207b] = [HA] (log(1) = 0). At this point, equal amounts of conjugate acid and base are present to neutralize either added acid or added base. The effective buffering range is typically pKa \u00b1 1, beyond which the buffer becomes overwhelmed. Option A is incorrect because at pH more than 3 units from pKa, virtually all buffer exists in one form (either HA or A\u207b), providing minimal buffering. Option B describes a fully deprotonated buffer that cannot absorb more base. Option C is incorrect because dilute buffers have low buffering capacity regardless of pH \u2014 buffering capacity depends on both concentration and the ratio of acid to base.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The buffering capacity is greatest at 0.50 equivalents of NaOH, which is the half-equivalence point where pH = pKa = 4.75. At this point, exactly half of the weak acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base (A\u207b), so [HA] = [A\u207b]. This equal proportion of acid and base means the buffer can effectively neutralize either added acid (A\u207b reacts with H\u207a) or added base (HA reacts with OH\u207b). Note that the pH changes slowly around this point (4.27 to 5.23 over 0.5 equivalents) but dramatically near the equivalence point (5.23 to 8.72 over 0.25 equivalents). Option B has high [HA] but low [A\u207b], providing poor buffering against acid. Option C is the equivalence point with no buffer remaining. Option D has excess NaOH, well beyond the buffer range.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "When water freezes, hydrogen bonds form a stable, open hexagonal crystalline lattice where each water molecule is tetrahedrally coordinated to four neighbors. This regular arrangement creates more empty space between molecules than exists in liquid water, where the constantly breaking and reforming hydrogen bonds allow closer molecular packing. Consequently, ice has a density of ~0.917 g/cm\u00b3 compared to liquid water's 1.000 g/cm\u00b3 at 4\u00b0C (maximum density). This anomalous expansion upon freezing is biologically crucial \u2014 floating ice insulates bodies of water, preventing them from freezing solid and allowing aquatic life to survive winter. Option B is incorrect because ice and liquid water contain the same H\u2082O molecules with the same mass. Option C reverses the relationship. Option D is incorrect because the density difference is intrinsic to the lattice structure, not due to air bubbles.",

      "correctAnswer": "TFTT",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE because cohesion between water molecules (via hydrogen bonds) creates a continuous column of water in xylem vessels. Combined with adhesion to xylem cell walls, this enables the transpiration-cohesion-tension mechanism that pulls water from roots to leaves, even in tall trees. S2 is FALSE because water actually has an unusually HIGH surface tension compared to most liquids, precisely because of strong hydrogen bonds. Water molecules at the surface are pulled inward by hydrogen bonds with interior molecules, creating high surface tension that allows insects like water striders to walk on water. S3 is TRUE because water's high heat of vaporization means that a large amount of heat energy (2,260 J/g) is absorbed when water evaporates. This creates effective evaporative cooling \u2014 sweating in humans and transpiration in plants dissipate heat efficiently. S4 is TRUE because water's density increases as it cools from room temperature to 4\u00b0C (normal thermal contraction), but then decreases between 4\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C as hydrogen bonds begin forming the open ice-like lattice.",

This consumes H\u207a ions, decreasing [H\u207a] and increasing pH (making blood more alkaline). This condition is called respiratory alkalosis. Normal blood pH is 7.35-7.45; hyperventilation can push it above 7.45. Option B reverses the direction \u2014 CO\u2082 removal decreases, not increases, H\u207a.

Therefore log([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b]) = 0.2, and [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = 10\u2070\u00b7\u00b2 \u2248 1.58.

      "explanation": "Capillary action results from two complementary forces: adhesion (the attraction between water molecules and the polar surface of the tube, such as glass) pulls water molecules up the tube wall, while cohesion (hydrogen bonds between water molecules) pulls adjacent water molecules along, creating a meniscus that rises until balanced by gravity. In narrow tubes (capillaries), the surface area to volume ratio is high, so adhesive forces can overcome gravity more effectively. This mechanism contributes to water transport in plant xylem. Option B describes different transport mechanisms not responsible for capillary action. Option C describes transpiration pull, a different mechanism.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE because blood pH is maintained within the narrow range of 7.35-7.45 by the bicarbonate buffer system, phosphate buffers, and proteins. Acidosis (pH < 7.35) or alkalosis (pH > 7.45) disrupts enzyme function, protein structure, and ion channel activity, potentially causing organ failure and death. S2 is TRUE because amino acids have ionizable groups (\u03b1-amino, \u03b1-carboxyl, and various side chains) that can donate or accept protons, functioning as buffers. Hemoglobin is a major protein buffer in blood. S3 is FALSE because adding a buffer to pure water WILL change its pH if the buffer's pH differs from 7.0. A phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 would shift pure water's pH from 7.0 to something closer to 7.2. The buffer establishes a new equilibrium pH. S4 is TRUE because within pKa \u00b1 1, both the conjugate acid and base are present in significant concentrations (10:1 to 1:10 ratio), providing effective resistance to pH changes in both directions.",

Surface tension depends on the net inward force on surface molecules from hydrogen bonding \u2014 as hydrogen bonds break more frequently at higher temperatures, this force weakens. Viscosity (resistance to flow) similarly depends on intermolecular attractions \u2014 weaker hydrogen bonding at higher temperatures allows molecules to slide past each other more easily.

More precisely, at pH 7.0 (which is 0.2 units below pKa\u2082 = 7.20), the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = 10\u207b\u2070\u00b7\u00b2 \u2248 0.63, meaning H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b slightly predominates over HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b (61% vs 39%).

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The most essential control is verifying that cytochalasin D treatment does not confound results through cytotoxicity or by independently altering the cAMP signaling pathway (Option B). If the drug kills cells or disrupts the signaling pathway itself, any observed changes in diffusion rate cannot be attributed solely to viscosity changes. Cell viability assays (trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay) and verification that cAMP production/degradation rates remain unchanged are critical controls. Option A (pure water control) provides useful reference data but is not essential \u2014 diffusion in water vs. cytoplasm is already well-documented. Option C (different-sized molecule) tests a different hypothesis about size-dependent diffusion, not the specific viscosity question. Option D (temperature series) is useful for thermodynamic analysis but not essential for the primary hypothesis about viscosity effects. The correct answer is B, not C.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "If AQP2 is specifically responsible for vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption in the collecting duct, then AQP2 knockout mice should fail to insert water channels in response to vasopressin signaling. The predicted phenotype is that vasopressin treatment (or endogenous vasopressin release during dehydration) would NOT increase collecting duct water permeability, resulting in production of large volumes of dilute urine \u2014 the hallmark of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This has been confirmed experimentally: AQP2 knockout mice indeed show severe polyuria and polydipsia unresponsive to vasopressin. Option B describes an opposite effect. Option C is unlikely to fully compensate because other aquaporins (AQP1, AQP3, AQP4) are expressed in different nephron segments and are not vasopressin-regulated. Option D is incorrect because AQP1 is in the proximal tubule and descending loop, not the collecting duct. The correct answer is A.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The hydrophobic effect is primarily an entropic phenomenon driven by water's behavior around nonpolar solutes. When nonpolar groups are exposed to water, surrounding water molecules form highly ordered 'clathrate' or 'iceberg' structures to maximize their hydrogen bonding while avoiding the nonpolar surface. This ordering dramatically decreases the entropy of the water. When nonpolar groups are buried in the protein interior during folding, these ordered water molecules are released back into the bulk solvent, where they can adopt many more orientational states \u2014 dramatically increasing water entropy. The favorable entropy gain of water release drives the hydrophobic effect. Option A is incorrect because van der Waals attractions between nonpolar groups are weak and not the primary driving force. Option C describes electrostatic effects that play a minor role. Option D is wrong because the peptide backbone is polar (N-H and C=O groups form hydrogen bonds). The correct answer is B.",

      "explanation": "Antifreeze proteins work through the adsorption-inhibition mechanism (also called the Kelvin effect or thermal hysteresis mechanism). AFPs bind irreversibly to specific faces of ice crystals, forcing ice growth to occur only between the bound AFP molecules. This creates curved ice fronts between the adsorbed proteins, and the Kelvin effect dictates that curved surfaces have lower freezing points than flat surfaces. The result is thermal hysteresis \u2014 a gap between the freezing and melting points \u2014 that prevents ice crystal growth within this temperature range. This is non-colligative (Option A is wrong) because the effect is far larger than predicted by the molar concentration of AFPs. Option B is wrong because AFPs do not break ice hydrogen bonds. Option C is wrong because AFPs do not create amorphous ice. AFPs are found in organisms including Arctic/Antarctic fish, insects, plants, and some bacteria.",

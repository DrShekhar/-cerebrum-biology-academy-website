Without sexual reproduction, the population would eventually shrink below the minimum viable cell size. Auxospore formation (typically triggered when cells reach ~30-40% of maximum size) involves sexual reproduction: gametes fuse to form a zygote (auxospore) that expands to the maximum species-specific size before depositing new full-sized frustules.

      "explanation": "Dinoflagellate bioluminescence occurs in membrane-bound organelles called scintillons that contain luciferin, luciferase, and luciferin-binding protein (LBP). At the resting pH of the scintillon (~8), LBP sequesters luciferin from luciferase. Mechanical stimulation triggers a signal cascade that causes proton flux from the acidic vacuole into the scintillon, lowering pH to ~6. At this pH, LBP releases luciferin, and luciferase catalyzes the oxidation reaction producing blue light (~474 nm). The ecological function is debated but the 'burglar alarm' hypothesis is well-supported: the flash startles small predators (copepods) and attracts larger visual predators (fish) that eat the copepods.

      "explanation": "Kinetoplastid RNA editing is one of the most remarkable examples of post-transcriptional gene processing in biology. Guide RNAs (gRNAs), encoded primarily by the thousands of minicircle DNA molecules in the kinetoplast, provide the information for editing. Each gRNA has: (1) an anchor region that base-pairs with the pre-edited mRNA downstream of the editing site; (2) a guiding region that specifies where U residues should be inserted or deleted through mismatches. The editosome (a ~20S complex containing endonuclease, terminal uridylyl transferase, exonuclease, and RNA ligase) catalyzes the editing. Some genes require extensive editing (pan-editing) with hundreds of U insertions, while others require only a few changes. The evolutionary reason for this elaborate system remains debated but may relate to regulatory flexibility. Option A describes trans-splicing, a different process. Option B is incorrect \u2014 editing is precisely templated. Option D invokes a non-existent mechanism.",

      "question": "In sickle cell disease, deoxygenated hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerizes into rigid fibers that distort erythrocytes. The polymerization follows a double-nucleation mechanism with a pronounced delay time that is highly dependent on intracellular HbS concentration. Hydroxyurea is the primary pharmacological therapy for sickle cell disease. Which mechanism best explains how hydroxyurea reduces sickling episodes?",
      "options": [
        "Hydroxyurea directly inhibits the lateral contacts between beta-6 valine and the hydrophobic pocket on an adjacent HbS tetramer, preventing fiber nucleation",
        "Hydroxyurea functions as a nitric oxide donor that vasodilates the microvasculature, but has no direct effect on HbS polymerization or hemoglobin composition",
        "Hydroxyurea is a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that causes S-phase arrest in erythroid precursors, and the resulting stress reactivates fetal hemoglobin (HbF/gamma-globin) expression; HbF tetramers (alpha2-gamma2) cannot co-polymerize with HbS, acting as chain terminators that disrupt fiber elongation and dramatically increase the delay time",
        "Hydroxyurea increases oxygen affinity of HbS by covalently modifying the beta-globin chain at cysteine-93, preventing the R-to-T conformational transition required for polymerization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Hydroxyurea's primary therapeutic mechanism in sickle cell disease is the induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). As a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea causes cytotoxic stress in erythroid progenitors, which paradoxically selects for cells that activate the gamma-globin gene through stress erythropoiesis pathways involving p38 MAPK, cGMP signaling, and possibly soluble guanylate cyclase activation. HbF (alpha2-gamma2) is the critical anti-sickling hemoglobin: gamma-globin has a glutamine at position 87 that sterically clashes with the lateral contact site required for HbS polymer extension, meaning HbF tetramers cannot be incorporated into the growing HbS fiber. This mixed inhibition dramatically extends the delay time for polymerization (delay time scales approximately as the 30th to 50th power of HbS concentration, so even modest reductions in effective HbS concentration via HbF dilution produce enormous increases in delay time). Option A is incorrect because hydroxyurea does not directly bind HbS. Option C describes a mechanism attributed to other agents (like voxelotor/GBT440) but not hydroxyurea. Option D has partial truth \u2014 hydroxyurea does generate NO as a secondary mechanism \u2014 but the primary clinical benefit derives from HbF induction.",

      "question": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Unaffected individuals have 10-35 repeats, while HD patients carry 36 or more. A notable feature of HD is anticipation \u2014 successive generations show earlier onset and increased severity. Which molecular mechanism best explains the intergenerational instability (expansion bias) of CAG repeats, particularly during paternal transmission?",
      "options": [
        "CAG repeats form stable hairpin structures during DNA replication by looping out on the nascent strand; Okazaki fragment processing by FEN1 and DNA ligase I is impaired by these structures, resulting in net expansion that is amplified during the numerous mitotic divisions of spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis",
        "The mismatch repair protein MSH3 specifically recognizes CAG/CTG hairpins and recruits error-prone translesion synthesis polymerases that add extra repeats during repair, but this process occurs exclusively during meiotic recombination",
        "CAG expansions arise solely from unequal crossing over between misaligned homologs during meiosis I, which is more frequent in male meiosis due to higher recombination rates on autosomes in males",
        "Somatic hypermutation machinery from B lymphocytes is aberrantly activated in germ cells, targeting repetitive DNA sequences including CAG tracts for expansion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats form stable DNA secondary structures \u2014 particularly hairpins stabilized by C-G and non-canonical A-A or T-T base pairs. During DNA replication, these hairpins form on the nascent strand during lagging strand synthesis. When an Okazaki fragment containing a looped-out CAG hairpin is incorporated without proper flap processing (FEN1 is inhibited by the structured DNA), the net effect is insertion of extra repeats. The expansion bias during paternal transmission is explained by the far greater number of mitotic cell divisions in spermatogenesis (~400 divisions by age 30, increasing with paternal age) compared to oogenesis (~23 divisions, completed before birth). Each replication cycle provides an opportunity for slip-strand mispairing and expansion. Additionally, the MMR pathway (particularly MSH2-MSH3) paradoxically promotes expansion rather than correction \u2014 MSH3 binds CAG hairpins and initiates a futile repair cycle that leads to expansion \u2014 but this occurs during DNA replication and repair, not exclusively during meiotic recombination (making option B partially correct but incomplete and incorrectly restricted). Option C is wrong because unequal crossing over is not the primary mechanism for trinucleotide repeat expansion. Option D is entirely fictional.",

The clinical severity varies widely among family members carrying the same mutation. Which concept best explains this phenotypic variability?",

        "Variable expressivity due to autosomal modifier genes that interact with the mitochondrial mutation through epistasis at nuclear-encoded respiratory chain subunits",
        "Heteroplasmy and the threshold effect: each cell contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria with multiple mtDNA copies, and the proportion of mutant versus wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy level) varies between tissues and individuals due to replicative segregation during cell division; symptoms manifest only when the mutant load exceeds a tissue-specific threshold (typically 60-90% for MELAS), and stochastic partitioning during oogenesis creates variable heteroplasmy levels among offspring",

        "Anticipation mediated by progressive expansion of the point mutation into a trinucleotide repeat during mitochondrial DNA replication in successive generations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Heteroplasmy and the threshold effect are the central concepts explaining phenotypic variability in mitochondrial diseases. Each human cell contains hundreds of mitochondria, and each mitochondrion contains 2-10 copies of the circular 16.5 kb mtDNA genome, giving roughly 1,000-10,000 mtDNA copies per cell. In a heteroplasmic individual (carrying both mutant and wild-type mtDNA), the proportion of mutant molecules varies between tissues due to replicative segregation \u2014 the random partitioning of mitochondria during mitosis. Different tissues have different energy demands and therefore different vulnerability thresholds: the brain and skeletal muscle (high oxidative demand) have lower thresholds (~60-80% mutant load) than tissues like liver or blood (~90-95%). The mtDNA bottleneck during oogenesis is critical for intergenerational variability: during early oogenesis, the number of mtDNA molecules is drastically reduced (to ~200 copies) before being amplified, creating a sampling effect that can dramatically shift heteroplasmy levels between mother and offspring. This explains why a mildly affected mother (50% mutant load) can have a severely affected child (90% mutant load) or an unaffected child (20% mutant load). Option A has some validity (nuclear modifiers exist) but does not explain the primary source of variability. Options C and D are incorrect \u2014 mtDNA is maternally inherited (not X-linked), and point mutations do not undergo repeat expansion.",

Patients carrying the HLA-B*57:01 allele are at high risk of a severe hypersensitivity reaction. What is the immunological mechanism underlying this drug-induced hypersensitivity?",

        "Abacavir is metabolized into a reactive intermediate that covalently modifies serum albumin, forming a neoantigen that triggers IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity through mast cell degranulation",
        "Abacavir directly cross-links adjacent HLA-B molecules on the cell surface, mimicking antibody-mediated receptor clustering and activating complement-dependent cytotoxicity",
        "HLA-B*57:01 encodes a defective transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), leading to accumulation of unprocessed abacavir-peptide complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering the unfolded protein response and apoptosis",
        "The HLA-B*57:01 molecule has a unique peptide-binding groove geometry; abacavir binds non-covalently within this groove, altering the repertoire of self-peptides that can be presented, causing previously hidden self-peptides to be displayed to CD8+ T cells, triggering an immune response indistinguishable from graft rejection (the altered peptide repertoire model)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The abacavir-HLA-B*57:01 interaction is one of the best-characterized pharmacogenomic associations and serves as a paradigm for drug-induced immune-mediated adverse reactions. X-ray crystallography (Illing et al., 2012) revealed that abacavir binds non-covalently within the F-pocket of the HLA-B*57:01 peptide-binding groove, occupying space that normally accommodates the C-terminal anchor residue of presented peptides. This fundamentally alters which self-peptides can fit into the groove: peptides that previously could not bind (due to incompatible anchor residues) now become high-affinity ligands because abacavir changes the shape and chemical properties of the binding pocket. The result is presentation of a novel self-peptide repertoire to CD8+ T cells. Because these self-peptides were not presented during thymic selection, T cells reactive against them were not deleted and remain in the peripheral repertoire. Upon abacavir exposure, these T cells mount a vigorous immune response against drug-modified self-peptide-MHC complexes, causing a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction. This is the 'altered peptide repertoire' model. HLA-B*57:01 does not encode TAP (which is encoded by separate genes TAP1 and TAP2). The reaction is T cell-mediated, not IgE-mediated or complement-mediated.",

      "question": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) analyzes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal blood to screen for fetal aneuploidies. The fetal fraction typically ranges from 5-20% of total cell-free DNA. Which principle underlies NIPT's ability to detect trisomy 21 in the fetus?",
      "options": [
        "NIPT uses PCR with chromosome 21-specific primers to amplify fetal DNA selectively, and the amplification product is quantified by gel electrophoresis to detect dosage differences",
        "Massively parallel shotgun sequencing of total cell-free DNA (maternal + fetal) maps millions of sequencing reads to chromosomal bins; a fetus with trisomy 21 contributes slightly more chromosome 21 fragments relative to a reference chromosome, producing a statistically significant increase in the proportion of chromosome 21 reads (a z-score approach) that is detectable even though fetal DNA is a minority of the total cfDNA pool",
        "NIPT relies on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of circulating fetal cells captured by anti-fetal hemoglobin antibodies, counting chromosome 21 signals directly in intact fetal nuclei",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "NIPT for aneuploidy detection is based on counting \u2014 specifically, the statistical overrepresentation of sequencing reads from an aneuploid chromosome. Cell-free DNA in maternal plasma is a mixture: approximately 85-95% maternal and 5-15% fetal (derived primarily from trophoblast apoptosis). In massively parallel shotgun sequencing (MPSS), total cfDNA is fragmented, sequenced to generate millions of short reads, and each read is mapped to its chromosome of origin. For a euploid fetus, the proportion of reads mapping to chromosome 21 matches the expected proportion based on chromosome 21's share of the genome (~1.5%). For a fetus with trisomy 21, there is one extra copy of chromosome 21 in fetal cells, contributing additional chromosome 21 fragments to the maternal plasma. If the fetal fraction is 10%, the expected increase in chromosome 21 reads is approximately 5% (one extra copy out of the two normal copies, scaled by fetal fraction). With millions of reads, this small increase is statistically significant and detected by calculating a z-score comparing observed versus expected chromosome 21 read proportions. The sensitivity exceeds 99% for trisomy 21. Option A is incorrect \u2014 NIPT does not use targeted PCR for aneuploidy detection. Option C describes a different (largely abandoned) approach using intact fetal cells. Option D overstates methylation-based enrichment, which has been explored experimentally but is not the standard NIPT methodology.",

      "question": "Ex vivo gene therapy for sickle cell disease using lentiviral vectors has shown remarkable clinical success. The approach involves transducing autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a lentiviral vector carrying a modified beta-globin gene (such as betaA-T87Q). Why are lentiviral vectors preferred over adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for this application?",
      "options": [
        "Lentiviral vectors have much larger packaging capacity (up to 40 kb) compared to AAV (4.7 kb), and the beta-globin locus control region exceeds AAV capacity",
        "AAV vectors integrate into the host genome more efficiently than lentiviral vectors, but at random sites that pose an unacceptable insertional mutagenesis risk, whereas lentiviral vectors integrate at safe harbor loci exclusively",
        "Lentiviral vectors integrate into the host cell genome, providing permanent transgene expression that is maintained through all subsequent HSC divisions and differentiated progeny; AAV vectors remain predominantly episomal and are progressively diluted during the extensive cell divisions of hematopoietic stem cell expansion and differentiation, making them unsuitable for lifelong correction of a continuously renewing tissue",
        "Lentiviral vectors can transduce quiescent HSCs but AAV vectors cannot enter non-dividing cells, making AAV incompatible with HSC transduction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The fundamental advantage of lentiviral vectors for HSC gene therapy is stable genomic integration. Lentivectors (derived from HIV-1) carry reverse transcriptase and integrase that convert the RNA genome to DNA and insert it into the host cell chromosome. Once integrated, the transgene is replicated as part of the host genome during every cell division, ensuring permanent expression in all progeny cells. This is essential for hematopoietic stem cells because they undergo extensive self-renewal and differentiation over decades, producing billions of differentiated blood cells. AAV vectors, by contrast, remain predominantly as episomal concatemers in the nucleus. While this is advantageous for post-mitotic tissues (liver, retina, neurons \u2014 where AAV provides stable long-term expression), episomal AAV genomes are progressively lost during cell division because they lack origins of replication and centromeres. In actively dividing HSCs, AAV transgene expression would decline rapidly as cells proliferate. Option A is incorrect because while AAV has limited capacity (~4.7 kb), the therapeutic beta-globin cassettes used in clinical trials (~3.5-4 kb with condensed LCR elements) can fit within AAV. Option B reverses the integration biology \u2014 lentiviral vectors integrate (with some risk), while AAV rarely integrates. Option D is backwards \u2014 AAV can efficiently transduce non-dividing cells, whereas early retroviral vectors (MLV-based) required cell division; lentiviral vectors solved this limitation for retroviruses.",

Which step is critical for installing the desired edit?",
      "options": [
        "The pegRNA contains a 3' extension with a primer binding site (PBS) that hybridizes to the nicked strand and a reverse transcription template (RTT) encoding the desired edit; after Cas9 nickase nicks the PAM-containing strand, the PBS anneals to the exposed 3'-end of the nicked strand, and the fused reverse transcriptase copies the RTT to synthesize a new DNA flap containing the edit, which is then incorporated through 5'-flap cleavage and ligation by endogenous DNA repair",
        "The Cas9 nickase creates a double-strand break at the target site, and the pegRNA serves as a homology-directed repair template that is directly incorporated by the cellular HDR machinery",
        "The reverse transcriptase domain synthesizes a complete complementary DNA copy of the pegRNA, which then displaces both strands of the target DNA through a branch migration mechanism similar to RecA-mediated strand exchange",
        "Prime editing requires co-delivery of a separate single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor because the reverse transcriptase only creates the nick and cannot synthesize new DNA using RNA as a template"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Prime editing is an elegant approach that circumvents the major limitations of both HDR-based editing (requires DSBs, low efficiency in non-dividing cells, competing NHEJ) and base editing (limited to transition mutations, bystander editing within the activity window). The mechanism proceeds in three key steps: (1) The spacer portion of the pegRNA guides the Cas9 H840A nickase to the target, where it nicks only the PAM-containing (non-target) strand, avoiding a DSB. (2) The primer binding site (PBS, typically 8-15 nt) at the 3' extension of the pegRNA anneals to the free 3'-end of the nicked strand by complementary base pairing. (3) The fused M-MLV reverse transcriptase (engineered for improved thermostability and processivity) uses the reverse transcription template (RTT) as a template to extend the nicked strand, synthesizing new DNA that contains the desired edit. This creates a 3'-flap (containing the edit) and a redundant 5'-flap (containing the original sequence). Cellular 5'-flap endonucleases (such as FEN1) preferentially remove the 5'-flap, and ligation installs the edit on one strand. A second nick on the non-edited strand (in the PE3 strategy) biases mismatch repair to use the edited strand as the template, completing the edit on both strands. Option B is wrong \u2014 no DSB is created. Option C describes a non-existent mechanism. Option D is wrong \u2014 no exogenous donor is needed.",

This discrepancy is known as 'missing heritability.' Which explanation is best supported by current evidence?",
      "options": [
        "GWAS results are largely false positives due to population stratification, and the true heritability of complex traits is near zero",
        "Nearly all missing heritability is due to rare variants with very large effects (odds ratios > 5) that are invisible to common-variant GWAS arrays but would be fully captured by whole-genome sequencing",
        "Much of the missing heritability is attributable to many common variants of individually small effect that fail to reach genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10^-8) in current sample sizes, plus contributions from rare variants, gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, and structural variants not well tagged by standard SNP arrays; methods like LD score regression and GREML that aggregate genome-wide signal confirm that common SNPs collectively explain a substantial fraction of heritability even when individual loci are not significant",
        "Epigenetic inheritance accounts for the majority of missing heritability because DNA methylation patterns are heritable but invisible to genotyping arrays, and twin-based heritability estimates are inflated by shared epigenetic environments"

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The missing heritability problem, first articulated by Manolio et al. (2009), has been substantially resolved by improved statistical methods and larger sample sizes. Key insights: (1) The 'infinitesimal model' \u2014 most complex trait heritability is distributed across thousands of common variants with tiny individual effects. GWAS only detects the tip of the iceberg (loci exceeding the stringent significance threshold). Methods like GREML (Genomic Relatedness Matrix Restricted Maximum Likelihood, developed by Yang et al.) and LD score regression estimate total heritability captured by all genotyped SNPs simultaneously, not just significant ones. For height, for example, individual GWAS loci explain ~25% of heritability, but all common SNPs collectively explain ~50-60%. (2) Rare variants contribute additional heritability not captured by common-variant arrays. (3) Structural variants (CNVs, inversions) are poorly tagged. (4) Gene-gene (epistatic) and gene-environment interactions inflate twin-based heritability estimates relative to additive models. (5) Some twin-based heritability is inflated by assortative mating and shared environment. Option A is wrong \u2014 GWAS associations replicate robustly, and genomic control methods correct for stratification. Option B overstates rare variant contribution \u2014 whole-genome sequencing studies show rare variants contribute modestly.

The drug consists of a synthetic double-stranded siRNA (targeting TTR mRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of an ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid. After intravenous administration, the LNPs rapidly adsorb apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from serum, which acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes. This exploits the liver's natural lipoprotein uptake pathway. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the ionizable lipid component is crucial for endosomal escape: as the endosomal pH drops, the lipid becomes positively charged, disrupts the endosomal membrane, and releases the siRNA into the cytoplasm. The siRNA duplex is then processed by the RISC-loading complex: the passenger (sense) strand is cleaved and discarded, while the guide (antisense) strand is loaded into AGO2, where it directs recognition and cleavage of complementary TTR mRNA, reducing transthyretin protein production by ~80%. Option A describes the mechanism of ASOs like inotersen (also approved for hATTR), not siRNA.

      "explanation": "Detection of more than two alleles at an autosomal STR locus is the hallmark of a DNA mixture. A diploid individual has exactly two alleles per autosomal locus (which may be identical in homozygotes). Three or more alleles at any single locus indicates the presence of DNA from multiple contributors. Mixture interpretation is one of the most challenging aspects of forensic genetics. Modern probabilistic genotyping software (e.g., STRmix, TrueAllele) uses continuous models that consider peak heights, stutter ratios, degradation, and inhibition to estimate the number of contributors, deconvolve individual genotype combinations, and calculate likelihood ratios for inclusion/exclusion of persons of interest. The software evaluates millions of possible genotype combinations weighted by allele frequencies to find the most probable contributor profiles. Option C is partially valid \u2014 stutter artifacts do occur (typically n-1 repeat units at 5-15% of the parent peak height) and must be distinguished from true alleles, but stutter peaks are usually recognizable by their characteristic size and lower intensity. In this scenario with three full-intensity alleles, a mixture is the correct interpretation. Option A is implausible for humans. Option D is theoretically possible but extremely rare for STR loci and would not be the primary forensic interpretation.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Huntington disease is the prototypical polyglutamine disorder. The expanded CAG repeat (>36 repeats) encodes a polyQ tract in the huntingtin protein. Mutant huntingtin undergoes conformational changes, forming beta-sheet-rich amyloid-like aggregates and intranuclear inclusions. These aggregates sequester critical cellular proteins including transcription factors (CBP, Sp1, TFIID), components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and molecular chaperones (Hsp70, Hsp40). This leads to transcriptional dysregulation, impaired protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately neuronal death, particularly in the striatum. S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: The statement contains a critical error. In fragile X syndrome, the expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) becomes HYPERmethylated, not hypomethylated, leading to transcriptional SILENCING of FMR1 and LOSS of FMRP protein. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic translation; its absence causes excessive protein synthesis at synapses, particularly through the mGluR5 pathway. S3 is TRUE: DM1 exemplifies the RNA toxic gain-of-function mechanism. Expanded CUG repeats form stable hairpin structures in the nucleus that bind and sequester the MBNL1 (Muscleblind-like 1) splicing factor while also stabilizing CELF1 (CUG-binding protein 1). The resulting splicing dysregulation affects hundreds of pre-mRNAs, reverting adult splicing patterns to fetal patterns \u2014 including aberrant splicing of the chloride channel CLCN1 (causing myotonia), the insulin receptor INSR (causing insulin resistance), and cardiac troponin TNNT2 (causing cardiac conduction defects). S4 is TRUE: Somatic instability is increasingly recognized as a key disease modifier. In HD, CAG repeats continue to expand somatically, particularly in striatal neurons, where expansions can reach 1,000+ repeats. The rate of somatic expansion correlates with disease severity and age of onset. DNA mismatch repair genes (MSH3, FAN1, PMS1, PMS2) have been identified as genetic modifiers of HD onset through GWAS, linking somatic expansion rates to disease progression.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: LHON is the most common mtDNA disease, caused primarily by three point mutations in Complex I subunits. The m.11778G>A mutation in MT-ND4 accounts for ~70% of cases. The male predominance is one of the most puzzling features of LHON \u2014 since mtDNA is maternally inherited, both sexes should inherit the mutation equally. The male bias is thought to involve X-linked modifier genes, hormonal influences (estrogen may be protective through effects on Complex I assembly and ROS scavenging), and possibly the higher metabolic rate of male retinal ganglion cells. Incomplete penetrance is also modulated by heteroplasmy level, mtDNA haplogroup background (haplogroup J increases risk), and environmental factors (smoking, alcohol). S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: KSS is caused by large-scale single deletions of mtDNA (typically 1.1-10 kb, with the 4,977 bp 'common deletion' being most frequent), NOT point mutations. KSS deletions are almost always sporadic (arising de novo during oogenesis or early development), not maternally inherited, because cells with deleted mtDNA have a replicative disadvantage in the germline bottleneck. KSS presents with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, cardiac conduction defects, and onset before age 20. S3 is TRUE: The mitochondrial genetic code deviates from the standard code at several codons. These deviations reflect the simplified decoding system in mitochondria, which uses only 22 tRNAs (compared to ~45 in the cytoplasm). Superwobble reading allows one tRNA to recognize all four codons in a family box. S4 is correctly labeled FALSE: The first part is true (mtDNA has ~10-17x higher mutation rate due to proximity to ROS-generating respiratory chain, lack of protective histones, and limited repair), but the claim of no utility in evolutionary genetics is wrong. mtDNA's high mutation rate, maternal inheritance, lack of recombination, and high copy number make it invaluable for population genetics, phylogeography, forensic identification, and molecular anthropology (e.g., mitochondrial Eve, human migration patterns).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: CYP2D6 metabolizes approximately 25% of all clinically used drugs. Its exceptional polymorphism results from point mutations, insertions, deletions, and whole-gene duplications/deletions. Poor metabolizers (PM, 5-10% of Caucasians) carry two non-functional alleles (e.g., *4/*4) and cannot metabolize CYP2D6 substrates, leading to drug accumulation and toxicity. Ultrarapid metabolizers (UM, 1-10% depending on population, up to 29% in East Africa) carry duplicated or amplified functional genes (e.g., *1/*1xN), producing excessive enzyme activity. S2 is TRUE: Warfarin pharmacogenomics is a landmark example. VKORC1 -1639G>A (or the linked 1173C>T) reduces VKORC1 expression, lowering the amount of drug target protein and increasing warfarin sensitivity. CYP2C9*2 and *3 reduce warfarin clearance. Together, VKORC1, CYP2C9, and clinical factors explain ~50-60% of warfarin dose variability. The FDA-approved label includes pharmacogenomic dosing recommendations. S3 is correctly labeled FALSE: The statement inverts the actual danger. CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers convert codeine to morphine FASTER and in greater quantities, leading to dangerously elevated morphine levels that can cause respiratory depression and death. This is particularly dangerous in children \u2014 several pediatric deaths have been attributed to codeine administered to CYP2D6 UM children, leading to FDA black box warnings and codeine restrictions in pediatric patients. S4 is TRUE: These are established pharmacogenomic tests mandated or strongly recommended before prescribing. TPMT/NUDT15 deficiency causes severe myelosuppression from thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: CAR-T cells represent a revolutionary approach to cancer immunotherapy. The CAR is a modular synthetic receptor: the scFv (derived from a monoclonal antibody) provides antigen recognition independent of MHC restriction; the hinge/transmembrane domain (from CD8 or CD28) anchors the receptor; the costimulatory domain(s) provide signal 2 for T cell activation; and CD3-zeta provides signal 1 (the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, ITAMs). Second-generation CARs have one costimulatory domain; third-generation have two. FDA-approved CAR-T products targeting CD19 (for B cell malignancies) include tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah, 4-1BB) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta, CD28). S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: The first part correctly describes gene drive mechanism \u2014 in heterozygotes, the drive cassette (containing Cas9 + gRNA targeting the homologous wild-type allele) cuts the wild-type allele, and HDR using the drive-containing chromosome as template converts the cell to homozygosity for the drive. This achieves >99% inheritance. However, the claim of no ecological risk is false. Gene drives pose significant ecological concerns: off-target effects, gene flow to non-target species through hybridization, potential for ecosystem disruption if a target species is suppressed, and evolutionary resistance. Self-limiting designs (daisy-chain drives, split drives) have been proposed to mitigate these risks. S3 is TRUE: These three AAV gene therapies represent milestone achievements. Luxturna (2017) treats RPE65-associated retinal dystrophy via subretinal injection. Zolgensma (2019) treats SMA type 1 via intravenous AAV9, which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix, 2022) delivers a hyperactive Factor IX Padua variant to hepatocytes. S4 is correctly labeled FALSE: While current base editors are limited to transitions (CBE: C-G to T-A; ABE: A-T to G-C), the statement that this has no clinical utility is wrong. Transitions account for ~60% of known pathogenic point mutations, and base editors have clinical utility for diseases like sickle cell disease (disrupting BCL11A erythroid enhancer), progeria (correcting the LMNA C-to-T mutation), and many others. Additionally, prime editing (not a base editor per se) can install any point mutation, indel, or combination.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: CVS is performed by sampling chorionic villi (placental tissue) either transcervically or transabdominally. The villi contain cytotrophoblast cells (for direct analysis or short-term culture) and mesenchymal core cells (for long-term culture). CVS provides results earlier than amniocentesis, enabling earlier decision-making. Procedure-related miscarriage risk is approximately 0.5-1% (slightly higher than amniocentesis at ~0.1-0.3%). CVS cannot measure amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein for neural tube defect screening \u2014 this requires amniocentesis. S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: While the description of PGT-M technique is largely accurate, the claim that biopsy has no effect on embryo viability is incorrect. Cleavage-stage biopsy (removing 1 of 6-8 cells) reduces implantation rates by approximately 10-20%. Trophectoderm biopsy at the blastocyst stage is less harmful because the inner cell mass (which forms the embryo) is not directly sampled, but some impact on implantation still exists. Additionally, whole genome amplification introduces artifacts (allele dropout, preferential amplification) that can cause misdiagnosis. S3 is TRUE: CPM occurs in approximately 1-2% of CVS samples. Because the trophoblast and embryo proper originate from different blastocyst lineages, a post-zygotic mitotic error in one lineage may not be present in the other. Type 1 CPM (abnormality in cytotrophoblast only) and Type 2 (in mesenchyme only) may give false-positive CVS results, while Type 3 (both placental layers) still does not necessarily indicate fetal involvement. When CVS reveals mosaicism, amniocentesis is recommended for confirmation. S4 is TRUE: cffDNA is derived predominantly from apoptotic syncytiotrophoblast cells that shed DNA fragments (predominantly ~143 bp, the size of chromatosomal DNA) into maternal circulation. The fetal fraction increases with gestational age and is cleared within 1-2 hours after delivery (half-life ~16 minutes), meaning a previous pregnancy does not interfere with subsequent NIPT testing.",

The Database of Genomic Variants catalogs over 500,000 CNV regions. Clinically significant CNVs include pathogenic deletions and duplications detected by chromosomal microarray analysis. S2 is TRUE: Chromothripsis (literally 'chromosome shattering'), described by Stephens et al. (2011), is detected in 2-3% of cancers (higher in certain types like osteosarcoma and glioblastoma). Evidence for a single catastrophic event includes: oscillating copy number states (typically 2 states rather than progressive gains/losses), random fragment orientation, and clustering of breakpoints on one chromosome. Proposed mechanisms include micronucleus formation followed by aberrant DNA replication or premature chromosome condensation.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The balancing selection maintaining HbS in malaria-endemic regions is mediated by multiple complementary mechanisms. Sickling of parasitized HbAS red cells leads to their recognition and removal by the spleen. HbS polymerization in parasitized cells alters membrane permeability, reducing K+ levels that the parasite needs for growth. Microarray studies show HbAS erythrocytes have altered expression of ~100 parasite genes. Enhanced phagocytosis of ring-stage parasitized HbAS cells by macrophages provides an innate clearance mechanism. The HO-1/CO pathway, demonstrated by Ferreira et al. (2011), prevents experimental cerebral malaria in mice by blocking heme-induced inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: The first part is accurate \u2014 BCL11A is indeed a key repressor of gamma-globin expression, and its erythroid enhancer is a validated therapeutic target. However, the claim of no clinical efficacy is wrong. The CRISPR-based therapy exa-cel (exagamglogene autotemcel/Casgevy), which disrupts the BCL11A erythroid enhancer, was approved by the FDA in December 2023 and has shown remarkable clinical efficacy. In trials, treated patients achieved sustained HbF levels of 30-40% and were free of vaso-occlusive crises for years. S3 is TRUE: The delay time for HbS nucleation has an extreme concentration dependence (approximately inversely proportional to [HbS]^30-50). This ultrasensitivity means that reducing intracellular HbS concentration by even 10-20% (through HbF dilution) can increase the delay time by orders of magnitude, often beyond the capillary transit time, effectively preventing sickling. This biophysical principle underlies the clinical efficacy of HbF induction. S4 is TRUE: Voxelotor was designed through structure-based drug design to allosterically modify hemoglobin. By binding to alpha-globin Val1, it increases oxygen affinity (left-shifts the oxygen dissociation curve), keeping more hemoglobin in the R-state. Since only deoxygenated T-state HbS polymerizes, reducing the deoxy-HbS pool decreases sickling. This mechanism is distinct from HbF induction and can be used in combination with hydroxyurea.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: LD is fundamental to GWAS design. Common genotyping arrays contain ~500,000 to 2,000,000 tag SNPs selected to capture most common variation through LD. In European populations, LD blocks (regions of correlated SNPs) typically span 10-100 kb, reflecting the ~1,000-2,000 generations since population bottlenecks. In African populations, LD extends over shorter distances (~5-10 kb) due to larger effective population size and more historical recombination, which is why GWAS in African populations have better fine-mapping resolution. S2 is correctly labeled FALSE: The threshold p < 5 x 10^-8 has a solid statistical basis \u2014 it represents a Bonferroni correction for approximately 1 million independent tests across the human genome (0.05/1,000,000 = 5 x 10^-8). The claim that findings fail to replicate is also wrong. GWAS associations that exceed genome-wide significance have an excellent replication rate (>95% in well-powered studies), which is a strength of the rigorous significance threshold. The pre-GWAS era of candidate gene studies had much lower replication rates. S3 is TRUE: PRS construction and cross-ancestry portability are critical issues. PRS methods (pruning-and-thresholding, LDpred, PRS-CS) differ in how they handle LD and select variants, but all create weighted sums. The portability problem is well-documented: a PRS developed in European GWAS has substantially reduced predictive accuracy in African, East Asian, or South Asian populations because (1) causal variants may have different allele frequencies, (2) LD patterns differ, so European tag SNPs may not tag the causal variant in other populations, and (3) gene-environment interactions may differ. This equity issue is a major concern driving diversity in GWAS. S4 is TRUE: Statistical fine-mapping is a critical step between GWAS discovery and biological interpretation. These methods model LD to determine which SNPs in a region are most likely causal. Credible sets contain the minimum set of variants with a specified probability (e.g., 95%) of containing the causal variant. Integration with functional annotations (ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics) prioritizes variants in regulatory elements.",

Key observations: (1) The expanded allele grows across generations during paternal transmission: 41 repeats (I-1, onset 58) -> 52 repeats (II-1, onset 42) -> 68 repeats (III-1, onset 25). Each generation gains 11-16 CAG repeats. (2) There is a strong inverse correlation between repeat length and age of onset: longer repeats cause earlier disease. This is characteristic of CAG repeat disorders like Huntington disease, where the expanded polyglutamine tract causes earlier and more severe protein aggregation. (3) The expansion bias during paternal transmission is explained by the many more mitotic cell divisions in spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis. Each DNA replication provides an opportunity for strand slippage at the repeat.

VKORC1 effect: The -1639G>A variant reduces VKORC1 promoter activity. The A allele is associated with lower VKORC1 mRNA and protein expression. With less drug target present, less warfarin is needed to achieve therapeutic inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factor carboxylation. The dose-genotype relationship is clear: GG > GA > AA for each CYP2C9 genotype (e.g., 42 > 28 > 18 for CYP2C9 *1/*1). CYP2C9 effect: CYP2C9 is the primary enzyme metabolizing S-warfarin (the more potent enantiomer). The *2 allele (R144C) reduces enzyme activity by ~30%, and *3 (I359L) by ~80%. Reduced metabolism means slower warfarin clearance, higher plasma levels, and lower dose requirements. The effect is visible across each VKORC1 row (e.g., for VKORC1 GG: 42 > 35 > 28 > 28 > 14 as CYP2C9 function decreases). Additive interaction: The effects are approximately additive (on a log scale), meaning both genes independently contribute to dose variability. Together, VKORC1 and CYP2C9 explain approximately 40% of warfarin dose variance, with clinical factors (age, body size, interacting drugs, diet) explaining an additional 15-20%. The 6-fold dose range between extreme genotypes (42 vs 7 mg/week) and the 12-fold bleeding risk difference strongly support pharmacogenomic-guided dosing. Option A ignores the clear CYP2C9 effect. Option B reverses the direction \u2014 reduced CYP2C9 means less clearance, not less activation. Option D ignores the clinical value of pre-emptive dosing.",

(2) Each sgRNA knocks out its target gene via Cas9-mediated DSBs and NHEJ-mediated frameshift mutations. (3) During the 14-day culture, cells are subjected to proliferative selection. Cells carrying sgRNAs against essential genes (RPL11/ribosome, RPS6/ribosome, POLR2A/RNA pol II, SF3B1/spliceosome) die or stop growing, depleting those sgRNAs (negative fold change). (4) Context-essential genes (KRAS in KRAS-addicted lines) represent oncogene addiction \u2014 these genes are essential only in specific genetic backgrounds.

Analysis of this electropherogram: (1) Five alleles are detected at a diploid locus, requiring a minimum of three alleles from at least two contributors (since one person contributes at most two alleles). (2) The victim's alleles (12 and 15) show high, balanced peak heights (4,200 and 4,350 RFU), consistent with being the major contributor. (3) Alleles 14 and 18 (1,850 and 1,720 RFU) are at lower but balanced heights consistent with a minor contributor, and they match the suspect's known profile. (4) The critical issue is allele 16 at 980 RFU. This allele is not explained by either known profile. Stutter (n-1 repeat unit artifact from PCR) from allele 17 would produce an allele 16 peak \u2014 but allele 17 is not present in the profile, ruling out standard stutter from allele 17. Stutter from allele 15 would produce allele 14 (n-1), not 16. Forward stutter (n+1) from allele 15 could produce allele 16, but forward stutter is typically much rarer (~1-2% vs 5-15% for back stutter). (5) Therefore, allele 16 most likely indicates a third contributor. This has profound legal implications: if a third contributor exists, the suspect's inclusion becomes less certain without probabilistic genotyping analysis. Modern forensic laboratories use probabilistic genotyping software that evaluates all possible contributor combinations and calculates likelihood ratios. Option A ignores the unexplained allele 16. Option C incorrectly attributes stutter to a non-existent allele 17. Option D applies an arbitrary threshold with no scientific basis.",

(2) Mitochondrial bottleneck: During oogenesis, the mtDNA copy number is reduced to ~200 molecules in primordial germ cells before being amplified. This bottleneck creates a sampling effect: oocytes from a heteroplasmic mother can have widely varying mutation loads. I-1 (35% in urine, a proxy for the germline proportion) produced offspring with dramatically different heteroplasmy levels: II-1 (82% urine), II-2 (10% urine), and II-3 (52% urine). This is stochastic partitioning, not Mendelian segregation (mtDNA does not undergo meiosis or recombination).

II-1's 78% muscle burden exceeds the 70% MELAS threshold, explaining her stroke-like episodes. II-3's 45% muscle burden is above the 40% myopathy threshold but below the MELAS threshold, explaining mild myopathy without strokes.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This comprehensive experimental design addresses all four levels of therapeutic ASO validation: RNA splicing, protein expression, channel function, and physiological readout. (1) RT-PCR/RT-qPCR for splicing: Primers flanking the cryptic exon in intron 22 will amplify two products \u2014 a longer band including the cryptic exon (aberrant) and a shorter band without it (correct). The dose-response relationship reveals the ASO concentration needed for effective exon skipping. RT-qPCR with junction-specific primers provides quantitative assessment. The scrambled control is essential to exclude non-specific effects of phosphorothioate chemistry (which can bind proteins non-specifically and activate innate immune sensors like TLR7/8). (2) Western blot for CFTR: Splicing correction should restore full-length CFTR protein (~168 kDa). The cryptic exon introduces a PTC that triggers NMD, so untreated cells produce little/no CFTR protein. Detection of band C (fully glycosylated, mature CFTR) indicates proper protein folding and trafficking to the plasma membrane. (3) Ussing chamber electrophysiology: This is the gold standard for CFTR function. Differentiated nasal epithelial monolayers on permeable supports are mounted in Ussing chambers. Forskolin activates CFTR via cAMP/PKA, producing a chloride secretory current (increase in short-circuit current, Isc). Application of CFTRinh-172 specifically inhibits CFTR, confirming the current is CFTR-dependent. The magnitude of forskolin-stimulated, CFTRinh-172-sensitive current quantifies functional rescue. (4) Forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay: Patient-derived intestinal organoids swell when CFTR is functional (forskolin activates CFTR-dependent fluid secretion into the organoid lumen). The area under the curve of swelling normalized to baseline is a validated, quantitative biomarker that correlates with clinical severity and drug response. This provides an independent, physiologically relevant confirmation in a second tissue type. Option A is inadequate \u2014 single concentration, single time point, qualitative gel assessment, no protein or functional readout. Option C is wrong \u2014 ASOs do not edit DNA; they work at the RNA level by sterically blocking splice site recognition. Option D measures the wrong parameter \u2014 total cellular chloride is not a direct readout of CFTR channel activity.",

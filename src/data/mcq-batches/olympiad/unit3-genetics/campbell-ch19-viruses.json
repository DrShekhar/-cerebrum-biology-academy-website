      "question": "The lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophage lambda represent two alternative developmental pathways. What molecular switch determines whether lambda enters the lytic or lysogenic pathway upon infection?",
      "options": ["The decision depends on the competition between the CI repressor (promoting lysogeny by repressing lytic genes) and the Cro protein (promoting lysis by repressing CI); at low multiplicity of infection with a healthy host, Cro dominates and lysis occurs; at high MOI or stressed host conditions, CI accumulates sufficiently to establish lysogeny by binding to OR1 and OR2 operators, activating its own transcription and repressing lytic genes", "The decision is random and has no molecular basis", "Lambda always enters the lytic cycle first and lysogeny occurs only after failed lysis", "The host cell membrane composition determines the viral pathway"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The lambda phage lytic-lysogenic decision is one of the best-understood genetic switches in biology, pioneered by Mark Ptashne and colleagues: (1) Key players: CI repressor (lambda repressor): a 236-amino acid protein that forms dimers and binds to the operator regions OR and OL. CI maintains lysogeny by repressing lytic gene transcription and activating its own transcription from PRM (promoter for repressor maintenance). Cro protein: a small (66 aa) repressor that also binds OR and OL, but with opposite binding preferences to CI. Cro promotes the lytic pathway by repressing CI transcription from PRM. (2) The OR operator has three binding sites (OR1, OR2, OR3) between divergent promoters PR (rightward, lytic genes) and PRM (leftward, CI gene). CI binding preference: OR1 > OR2 > OR3. Cro binding preference: OR3 > OR2 > OR1. (3) Lysogenic pathway: When CI is produced (from the establishment promoter PRE, activated by CII protein): CI dimers bind OR1 first — this represses PR (blocking lytic gene transcription). CI at OR1 cooperatively recruits CI to OR2 — this both further represses PR AND activates PRM (positive autoregulation of CI). At normal CI levels, OR3 is NOT occupied, so PRM is active. This creates a stable lysogenic state maintained by CI positive autoregulation. (4) Lytic pathway: When Cro accumulates (from PR): Cro binds OR3 first — this represses PRM (blocking CI transcription). Without CI, PR and PL remain active, expressing all lytic functions. (5) Decision parameters: High multiplicity of infection (MOI): more CII protein accumulates, activating PRE, producing more CI → lysogeny. UV damage/SOS response: RecA-stimulated CI autocleavage (same mechanism as LexA) → lytic induction. Host cell health: starved or UV-damaged host activates SOS → lysis.",

      "question": "HIV-1 uses a complex replication strategy involving reverse transcriptase. What three enzymatic activities does HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possess, and why is the enzyme error-prone?",
      "options": ["HIV-1 RT has RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (synthesizing DNA from the RNA template), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (copying the first-strand cDNA into dsDNA), and RNase H activity (degrading the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids during reverse transcription); it lacks 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity, resulting in approximately one error per genome per replication cycle", "HIV-1 RT is a highly accurate enzyme with error rates lower than cellular DNA polymerases", "HIV-1 RT has only one enzymatic activity — RNA polymerization", "HIV-1 RT requires host cell DNA polymerase for all DNA synthesis steps"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits (p51 is derived from p66 by proteolytic processing) with three essential activities: (1) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP): The primary function — synthesizing a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand using the viral RNA genome as a template. This proceeds from a cellular tRNA primer (tRNALys3) that anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the viral RNA. (2) RNase H: Degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes. This is essential for: removing the RNA template after minus-strand DNA synthesis, generating the polypurine tract (PPT) primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis, and removing tRNA and PPT primers after they have served their function. (3) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP): Copies the minus-strand cDNA to generate the double-stranded proviral DNA. (4) Error rate: HIV-1 RT has an error rate of approximately 3.4 x 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle (about 1 mutation per 10 kb genome per cycle). This is ~10,000-fold higher than cellular DNA polymerases (which have proofreading exonuclease activity). The high error rate results from the absence of 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. (5) Consequences of error-prone replication: Rapid evolution: Within a single infected individual, HIV generates a cloud of variants (quasispecies) that enables immune escape, drug resistance, and tropism switching (CXCR4 vs. CCR5 coreceptor usage). Drug resistance: Mutations in RT (e.g., M184V for lamivudine resistance, K103N for nevirapine resistance) emerge rapidly under antiretroviral therapy, necessitating combination therapy (HAART). (6) RT as a drug target: Nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs: AZT, tenofovir, emtricitabine) are chain terminators lacking the 3'-OH for next nucleotide addition. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs: efavirenz, nevirapine) bind an allosteric pocket near the active site, distorting the enzyme.",

      "question": "Evaluate the following statements about viral genome types and replication strategies:\nS1: Baltimore Class IV viruses (positive-sense ssRNA, like poliovirus) can use their genomic RNA directly as mRNA for immediate translation upon entry into the host cell\nS2: Baltimore Class V viruses (negative-sense ssRNA, like influenza) must carry their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within the virion because the negative-sense genome cannot serve as mRNA\nS3: Retroviruses (Baltimore Class VI) integrate a DNA copy of their RNA genome into the host chromosome as a provirus, which is then transcribed by host RNA Pol II\nS4: All DNA viruses replicate exclusively in the nucleus of the host cell",
      "options": ["S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-True", "S1-False, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-True"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: Positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA) viruses have genomes that are equivalent in polarity to mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly bound by host ribosomes and translated. For poliovirus: the ~7.4 kb genome contains a single ORF translated into a large polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by viral proteases (2Apro, 3Cpro/3CDpro) into structural proteins (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (including the RdRp 3Dpol). The 5' UTR contains an IRES that mediates cap-independent translation. S2 TRUE: Negative-sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) viruses carry genomes that are complementary to mRNA and cannot be directly translated. The virion must package its own RdRp to transcribe the negative-sense genome into positive-sense mRNAs upon entry. For influenza: the three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) are packaged with each of the eight genomic RNA segments as ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The polymerase uses a unique cap-snatching mechanism: PB2 binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, and PA cleaves 10-13 nt downstream, using this capped fragment as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis. S3 TRUE: Retroviruses (HIV, HTLV, MLV) use reverse transcriptase to convert their +ssRNA genome into dsDNA. The viral integrase enzyme then catalyzes integration of this dsDNA (provirus) into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the provirus is permanent and is transcribed by host RNA Pol II from the 5' LTR promoter. S4 FALSE: While most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses), the Poxviridae (vaccinia, variola/smallpox) replicate entirely in the CYTOPLASM. Poxviruses are large enough to encode their own DNA replication machinery, transcription enzymes, and mRNA processing factors, making them independent of the nuclear machinery.",

      "question": "Researchers infect bacterial cells with two different T4 phage mutants: Mutant A carries a mutation in gene 23 (major capsid protein) and Mutant B carries a mutation in gene 34 (tail fiber protein). Neither mutant can produce plaques alone. When cells are co-infected with both mutants simultaneously, plaques appear at a frequency of 2%. What genetic phenomenon explains this result?",
      "options": ["Genetic recombination between the two phage genomes during co-infection generates wild-type recombinant phages with functional copies of both gene 23 and gene 34; the 2% plaque frequency reflects the recombination frequency between the two gene loci, indicating they are relatively far apart on the T4 genome", "The two mutant phages spontaneously reverted to wild-type simultaneously", "The host bacteria produced the missing proteins for both mutants", "The two phage genomes fused into a single larger genome containing both functional genes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This is a classic phage cross experiment demonstrating intergenic recombination: (1) Experimental logic: Mutant A is gene 23-minus, gene 34-plus (23- 34+). Mutant B is gene 23-plus, gene 34-minus (23+ 34-). Neither can complete the lytic cycle alone because each lacks one essential function. (2) Co-infection: When both mutants infect the same bacterial cell simultaneously, both genomes replicate. During replication, the linear phage DNA molecules undergo homologous recombination (T4 has its own recombination machinery including UvsX, analogous to RecA). (3) Recombination outcomes: Parental types: 23- 34+ and 23+ 34- (non-functional, no plaques). Recombinant type 1: 23+ 34+ (wild-type recombinant, produces plaques). Recombinant type 2: 23- 34- (double mutant, non-functional). (4) Recombination frequency: The 2% plaque frequency represents the frequency of wild-type recombinants (23+ 34+). By convention, the map distance between gene 23 and gene 34 is estimated as 2 x 2% = 4 map units (multiplied by 2 because both recombinant classes — wild-type and double mutant — are produced in equal frequency, but only wild-type forms plaques). (5) Historical significance: Phage crosses were used by Seymour Benzer to map the rII region of T4 at extraordinary resolution, demonstrating that genes are composed of linear sequences of nucleotides (sites of mutation) and establishing the concept of the cistron (functional unit of the gene, equivalent to what we now call a gene). Benzer's work provided the first evidence for the fine structure of the gene before DNA sequencing was possible.",

      "question": "Influenza A virus undergoes antigenic shift and antigenic drift. What distinguishes these two mechanisms of antigenic variation, and why is antigenic shift more dangerous?",
      "options": ["Antigenic drift involves gradual accumulation of point mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes through error-prone RNA replication; antigenic shift involves reassortment of entire genome segments between different influenza strains co-infecting the same cell, potentially generating a novel HA or NA subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity, causing pandemics", "Antigenic drift produces larger changes than antigenic shift", "Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza B, not influenza A", "Both mechanisms produce identical types of antigenic changes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Influenza A virus antigenic variation operates through two distinct mechanisms with vastly different epidemiological consequences: (1) Antigenic drift (gradual change): The influenza RdRp (PB1-PB2-PA complex) lacks proofreading activity, producing approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle. Mutations in the antigenic sites of HA (hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein targeted by neutralizing antibodies) and NA (neuraminidase) gradually alter the epitopes recognized by the immune system. Antigenic drift is responsible for seasonal flu epidemics — previous immunity provides partial but incomplete protection against drifted variants, requiring annual vaccine updates. (2) Antigenic shift (major change): Influenza A has a segmented genome (8 segments). When two different influenza A subtypes co-infect the same cell (e.g., in a pig, which can be infected by both avian and human strains), their genome segments can be randomly reassorted during virion assembly. This can generate a virus with an entirely new HA and/or NA subtype to which the human population has NO pre-existing immunity. (3) Why shift is more dangerous: Drift changes: antibodies from previous infections/vaccinations still partially cross-react (reduced but not absent protection). Annual epidemics with moderate morbidity/mortality. Shift changes: entirely new HA or NA subtype, NO cross-reactive antibodies in the population, potential for pandemic (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, 2009 H1N1pdm). (4) HA subtypes: 18 known HA subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1-N11). Only H1, H2, H3 and N1, N2 have caused sustained human-to-human transmission. (5) Mixing vessel hypothesis: Pigs can be co-infected with avian and human influenza strains, serving as a mixing vessel for reassortment. However, reassortment can also occur in humans, birds, or other hosts.",

      "question": "A researcher isolates a novel virus from diseased plants. To determine whether the virus has an RNA or DNA genome, she purifies the viral nucleic acid and treats separate aliquots with DNase I, RNase A, and both enzymes. The nucleic acid is completely degraded by RNase A alone but resistant to DNase I. Additionally, when the nucleic acid is denatured and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, it migrates as a single band. What can she conclude about the genome?",
      "options": ["The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome: sensitivity to RNase A confirms RNA (not DNA), resistance to DNase I confirms no DNA component, and migration as a single band after denaturation indicates a single-stranded (not double-stranded) molecule since dsRNA would separate into two complementary strands", "The virus has a double-stranded DNA genome", "The virus has a double-stranded RNA genome", "The virus has no nucleic acid and is a prion"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This systematic nuclease sensitivity analysis reveals the genome type: (1) RNase A sensitivity: RNase A (ribonuclease A) specifically cleaves single-stranded RNA at pyrimidine (C and U) residues. Complete degradation by RNase A demonstrates the genome is RNA. DNase I resistance confirms it is not DNA. This immediately classifies the virus as an RNA virus (Baltimore Class III, IV, or V). (2) Single-stranded determination: When a double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA or dsDNA) is denatured (heated or treated with formamide/NaOH), the two complementary strands separate and migrate as two bands on a denaturing gel (or as a band with different mobility than the native molecule). When a single-stranded nucleic acid is denatured, it simply loses secondary structure but remains as a single molecule, migrating as a single band. The observation of a single band after denaturation indicates ssRNA. (3) Classification: The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome. To determine sense (positive or negative), additional tests are needed: if the purified RNA is infectious when transfected into plant cells, it is positive-sense (can be directly translated); if not infectious alone, it is negative-sense (requires viral RdRp). Most plant RNA viruses are positive-sense ssRNA (e.g., Tobacco Mosaic Virus, Potato Virus X, Cucumber Mosaic Virus). (4) Additional characterization: RT-PCR and sequencing would reveal the complete genome sequence. Electron microscopy of purions would reveal virion morphology (rod-shaped for TMV-like, icosahedral for others). Protease treatment before nuclease treatment confirms the nucleic acid is within a protein coat (capsid protects genome in intact virions).",

      "question": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using a specific receptor. What is the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry?",
      "options": ["The viral Spike (S) protein trimer binds human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD); the S protein is then cleaved by host proteases TMPRSS2 (at the cell surface) or cathepsins (in endosomes) at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide that inserts into the host membrane and drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes", "SARS-CoV-2 enters through receptor-mediated endocytosis using the transferrin receptor", "The virus injects its genome through the cell membrane like a bacteriophage", "SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by directly fusing with the nuclear envelope"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SARS-CoV-2 entry is a multi-step process involving receptor binding and protease-dependent membrane fusion: (1) Spike protein structure: The S protein is a large (~1,273 aa) trimeric class I fusion protein on the viral envelope. Each monomer has two subunits: S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (membrane fusion). S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues ~319-541). The RBD exists in two conformations: 'down' (receptor-inaccessible, immune-evasive) and 'up' (receptor-accessible). (2) ACE2 binding: The RBD in the 'up' conformation binds human ACE2 with nanomolar affinity. ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease normally involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7). It is expressed on type II alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and other tissues. (3) S protein priming: The S protein must be proteolytically activated: S1/S2 cleavage: The furin cleavage site (RRAR, a polybasic insertion not found in closely related bat coronaviruses) at the S1/S2 boundary is cleaved during biosynthesis in the producer cell's Golgi. This primes the protein. S2' cleavage: At the target cell, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) cleaves at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide. Alternatively, in cells lacking TMPRSS2, the virus enters via endocytosis and cathepsin L cleaves S2' in the acidic endosome. (4) Membrane fusion: The exposed S2 fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The S2 heptad repeat regions (HR1, HR2) fold into a six-helix bundle (6-HB), pulling the viral and cell membranes together and driving membrane fusion, releasing the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. (5) Therapeutic targets: Monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD block ACE2 binding. TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat, nafamostat) block protease priming. Fusion inhibitors targeting the 6-HB formation are in development.",

      "question": "The Hershey-Chase experiment (1952) provided critical evidence that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material of bacteriophage T2. What was the key experimental design that allowed them to distinguish between DNA and protein?",
      "options": ["They differentially labeled phage DNA with radioactive 32P (phosphorus, present in DNA but not in protein) and phage protein with radioactive 35S (sulfur, present in protein but not in DNA); after infection and blender treatment to separate phage coats from bacteria, 32P was found inside the bacterial cells while 35S remained in the supernatant", "They used electron microscopy to directly visualize DNA entering the bacteria", "They treated phages with DNase and protease separately to see which destroyed infectivity", "They sequenced the phage genome and compared it to the protein sequences"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment exploited the chemical differences between DNA and protein: (1) Rationale: In 1952, the debate between DNA and protein as the genetic material was ongoing despite Avery-MacLeod-McCarty's 1944 transformation experiments. Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage T2 because its biology was well understood: the phage injects its genetic material into E. coli while the protein coat remains outside. (2) Labeling strategy: Phosphorus (P) is present in DNA (phosphodiester backbone) but absent from amino acids/proteins. Sulfur (S) is present in proteins (cysteine and methionine amino acids) but absent from DNA. They grew T2 phage in E. coli cultures containing either 32P (radioactive phosphorus, labeling DNA) or 35S (radioactive sulfur, labeling protein) in separate preparations. (3) Infection experiment: 32P-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → after infection, blender treatment (shearing force) separated empty phage coats ('ghosts') from infected bacteria → centrifugation pelleted bacteria (heavier) from phage coats (lighter supernatant). Result: 32P was found primarily in the bacterial pellet. 35S-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → same procedure. Result: 35S was found primarily in the supernatant (phage coats). (4) Interpretation: DNA (32P) enters the bacterial cell and directs phage reproduction, while protein (35S) remains outside. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material of phage T2. (5) Historical context: Combined with Avery's transformation experiment, Chargaff's rules, and Watson-Crick's structure (1953), this experiment helped establish the central role of DNA as the universal genetic material. Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize with Delbruck and Luria.",

      "question": "Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of protein. What is the molecular mechanism by which the prion protein PrPSc converts normal PrPC into the misfolded infectious form?",
      "options": ["PrPSc acts as a template that induces a conformational change in normal PrPC: the alpha-helix-rich PrPC refolds into the beta-sheet-rich PrPSc conformation through direct protein-protein interaction; PrPSc then recruits and converts additional PrPC molecules in an autocatalytic cascade, forming amyloid fibrils that are protease-resistant and accumulate as neurotoxic aggregates", "PrPSc contains a viral nucleic acid that directs the synthesis of more PrPSc", "PrPSc is an enzyme that chemically modifies PrPC through phosphorylation", "PrPSc causes mutations in the PRNP gene that change the amino acid sequence of PrPC"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The prion hypothesis, proposed by Stanley Prusiner (Nobel Prize 1997), describes a unique mechanism of infectious disease: (1) Normal PrPC: The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein (253 amino acids in humans) expressed on the surface of neurons and other cell types. PrPC has a predominantly alpha-helical structure (42% alpha-helix, 3% beta-sheet). Its normal function is debated but may involve copper binding, cell signaling, and synaptic function. (2) PrPSc (scrapie form): The misfolded, disease-associated form has the SAME amino acid sequence as PrPC but a dramatically different conformation: 43% beta-sheet, 30% alpha-helix. PrPSc is insoluble, resistant to proteinase K digestion (yielding a protease-resistant core called PrP27-30), and resistant to denaturation by heat, UV, formaldehyde, and most sterilization procedures. (3) Conversion mechanism: The protein-only model proposes that PrPSc physically contacts PrPC and acts as a template for conformational conversion. The monomer conversion model: one PrPSc molecule converts one PrPC molecule in a 1:1 interaction. More likely, the nucleated polymerization model: small PrPSc oligomers (seeds/nuclei) recruit PrPC monomers to their growing ends, converting them to PrPSc. When fibrils break (fragmentation), more seeds are created, exponentially amplifying the process. (4) Amyloid formation: PrPSc molecules stack into cross-beta amyloid fibrils — extended beta-sheets with beta-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis. These fibrils aggregate into amyloid plaques visible histologically as spongiform change (vacuolation of brain tissue). (5) Prion strains: Different prion strains cause different disease phenotypes (incubation period, brain region affected) despite having the same amino acid sequence. This is explained by different PrPSc conformations — each strain represents a distinct stable misfolded structure that faithfully self-replicates. (6) Diseases: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, fatal familial insomnia (humans), scrapie (sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/'mad cow'), chronic wasting disease (deer/elk).",

      "question": "Bacteriophage T4 has evolved multiple mechanisms to take over the host cell's biosynthetic machinery. How does T4 redirect host RNA polymerase to transcribe phage genes instead of bacterial genes?",
      "options": ["T4 modifies the host RNA polymerase through ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit (by Alt and Mod proteins injected with the phage DNA), degrades the host DNA (using nucleases to recycle nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis), and replaces the host sigma-70 factor with phage-encoded anti-sigma factors and new sigma-like proteins (e.g., MotA, AsiA) that redirect RNAP to phage promoters", "T4 carries its own complete RNA polymerase and never uses the host enzyme", "T4 DNA is automatically preferred by host RNA polymerase without any modifications", "T4 inhibits all transcription and relies entirely on pre-made host mRNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "T4 takeover of host gene expression is a multi-pronged strategy executed in temporal phases: (1) Immediate early (0-2 min): Proteins co-injected with the T4 DNA (Alt, internal protein I): Alt is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies Arg265 on one alpha subunit of host RNAP. This modification (occurring before any phage genes are transcribed) subtly alters RNAP promoter specificity to favor some T4 early promoters. MotA and AsiA proteins are expressed early: AsiA (Anti-Sigma 70 Inhibitor A) binds to region 4.2 of sigma-70, blocking its interaction with the -35 element of bacterial promoters. MotA (Modifier of Transcription A) binds to AsiA-modified sigma-70 and redirects RNAP to T4 middle-mode promoters that have a MotA-dependent element (MotA box) instead of a -35 sequence. (2) Host DNA degradation: T4 encodes several nucleases that degrade the host chromosome. T4 DNA is protected from its own nucleases by modification — T4 DNA contains hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) instead of cytosine, and HMC is further glucosylated by T4-encoded glucosyltransferases. This modified DNA is resistant to T4 restriction endonucleases that degrade unmodified (host) DNA. The degraded host DNA provides nucleotides for T4 DNA synthesis. (3) Alg (Anti-Late Gene silencing): At later times, the anti-sigma factor alters transcription patterns further. (4) Late gene transcription: T4 late genes are transcribed from late promoters that require the sigma factor-like protein gp33 and the co-activator gp55, along with the sliding clamp gp45 (T4 DNA polymerase processivity factor) loaded on T4 DNA. This couples late gene transcription to active T4 DNA replication — ensuring structural proteins are only made when DNA replication is well underway. (5) Net result: Within 5-10 minutes of infection, all host gene expression is shut down and the entire biosynthetic capacity of the cell is redirected to phage production.",

      "options": ["Integrase processes the 3' ends of the linear viral dsDNA by removing 2 dinucleotides (3' processing), then catalyzes a strand transfer reaction where the recessed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack phosphodiester bonds on opposite strands of target host DNA separated by 4-6 bp, creating a gapped intermediate that is repaired by host enzymes generating target site duplications (TSDs)", "Integrase uses homologous recombination to insert viral DNA at sites of sequence identity", "Viral DNA replaces an equivalent length of host DNA through a cut-and-paste mechanism", "Integration requires host topoisomerase II and occurs only at nuclear matrix attachment sites"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Retroviral integration is a well-characterized enzymatic process: (1) Integrase structure: A 32 kDa enzyme (288 aa in HIV-1) with three domains: N-terminal domain (HHCC zinc-binding motif), catalytic core domain (DDE catalytic triad: D64, D116, E152, which coordinate two Mg2+ ions essential for catalysis), and C-terminal domain (non-specific DNA binding). Integrase functions as a multimer (tetramer is the active form). (2) 3' processing: In the cytoplasm (within the preintegration complex, PIC), integrase recognizes the conserved att sequences at both ends of the viral DNA (CA dinucleotide at each 3' end) and removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end, exposing recessed 3'-OH groups (reactive hydroxyl groups). (3) Nuclear import: The PIC (viral DNA + integrase + other viral and host proteins including LEDGF/p75) is transported into the nucleus. LEDGF/p75 (Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor) is a host chromatin-associated protein that tethers integrase to active transcription units (targeting integration to gene bodies of actively transcribed genes). (4) Strand transfer: Integrase catalyzes a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction: the two exposed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack the phosphodiester backbone of the target DNA on opposite strands, staggered by 5 bp (for HIV-1). This inserts the viral DNA into the host chromosome with 5 bp single-stranded gaps at each junction and 2-nt 5' overhangs of viral DNA that must be removed. (5) Gap repair: Host DNA repair enzymes (likely base excision repair and possibly NHEJ/HR pathways) remove the 2-nt overhangs, fill in the 5 bp gaps, and ligate the junctions. This generates the characteristic 5 bp target site duplications (TSDs) flanking the integrated provirus — a hallmark of retroviral integration. (6) Drug target: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs: raltegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, cabotegravir) are potent antiretroviral drugs that block the strand transfer step by chelating the catalytic Mg2+ ions.",

After infection at time 0, they observe an initial eclipse period (0-12 min) during which no intracellular phage particles are detectable, followed by a latent period (0-25 min) during which no extracellular phage are released. At 25 minutes, cell lysis begins and phage titer increases rapidly, plateauing at ~200 phage per original infected cell (burst size = 200). What do the eclipse and latent periods represent?",
      "options": ["The eclipse period is the time required for phage components (DNA, proteins) to be synthesized before any complete virions are assembled; the latent period extends from infection to the first cell lysis event, during which complete intracellular phage accumulate after the eclipse ends but are not yet released because the cell membrane is still intact", "The eclipse period represents the time for phage DNA to replicate while proteins are already made", "The latent period is caused by a delay in phage adsorption to the host cell", "Both periods represent inactive phage that have lost infectivity temporarily"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The one-step growth curve, developed by Emory Ellis and Max Delbruck (1939), reveals the intracellular phage replication timeline: (1) Experimental setup: Bacteria are infected at high MOI (to synchronize infection). Unadsorbed phage are removed. At time intervals, samples are taken and: (a) plated directly (measures extracellular free phage), or (b) treated with chloroform (lyses cells, measures total phage = intracellular + extracellular). (2) Eclipse period (0-12 min in this example): During this period, no complete phage particles exist anywhere — not extracellular (no lysis yet) and not intracellular (components haven't been assembled yet). The phage genome has entered the cell and is being replicated and transcribed, mRNA is being translated into phage proteins, but individual components (capsid proteins, tail fibers, baseplate, DNA) have not yet been assembled into complete infectious virions. Chloroform lysis at this time releases only disassembled components — no plaques form. This period was first described by Anderson and Doermann (1952). (3) Post-eclipse, pre-lysis (12-25 min): After the eclipse ends, intracellular assembly begins. Complete phage particles accumulate inside the cell. If cells are lysed artificially (chloroform), increasing numbers of phage are detected. However, no phage are detected externally because the cell has not yet lysed naturally. (4) Latent period (0-25 min): The total time from infection to the first release of phage by natural cell lysis. It includes the eclipse period plus the maturation period. (5) Rise period (25-~35 min): Cells lyse (triggered by phage-encoded holins and lysozyme/endolysin), releasing assembled phage. The titer increases from 1 to ~200 phage per cell. (6) Burst size = 200: Each infected cell produces approximately 200 progeny phage. This number varies by phage type (T4: ~200, T7: ~100, lambda: ~100).",

      "question": "Ebola virus (a filovirus) has a negative-sense RNA genome. How does Ebola's VP35 protein help the virus evade the host innate immune response?",
      "options": ["VP35 is a double-stranded RNA binding protein that sequesters viral dsRNA replication intermediates, preventing their detection by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5; VP35 also directly inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and blocks IFN-beta production, effectively suppressing the type I interferon antiviral response", "VP35 stimulates the interferon response to help clear the infection faster", "VP35 is a structural protein that forms the viral envelope and has no immune evasion function", "VP35 degrades all host mRNAs to prevent interferon production"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ebola VP35 is a multifunctional virulence factor that is critical for immune evasion: (1) dsRNA binding: During Ebola replication, the viral RdRp (L protein) generates dsRNA intermediates (replication intermediates and potentially dsRNA ends of panhandle structures). These dsRNA molecules are normally sensed by cytoplasmic innate immune sensors: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I) recognizes short dsRNA with 5'-triphosphate ends, and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) recognizes long dsRNA. VP35 contains a dsRNA-binding domain (IID domain, residues 220-340) that binds and sequesters dsRNA, physically preventing recognition by RIG-I and MDA5. Crystal structures show VP35 caps the dsRNA ends, hiding the 5'-triphosphate from RIG-I. (2) Inhibition of RIG-I signaling: VP35 also directly interacts with PACT (Protein Activator of PKR), which normally activates RIG-I signaling. By binding PACT, VP35 prevents PACT-mediated RIG-I activation. (3) Inhibition of IRF3: VP35 inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3) by the kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. Without IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 cannot dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, or activate the IFN-beta promoter. This blocks the primary transcriptional induction of type I interferons. (4) Inhibition of IRF7: VP35 also inhibits IRF7 activation, blocking the amplification loop of interferon production. (5) Consequence: By simultaneously suppressing dsRNA sensing and IFN signaling at multiple points, VP35 creates an environment of unchecked viral replication. The absence of IFN-mediated antiviral defenses allows explosive viral replication in macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. This contributes to the severe pathology of Ebola virus disease (hemorrhagic fever, multi-organ failure, up to 90% fatality rate for some outbreaks). (6) VP24 cooperation: Another Ebola protein, VP24, inhibits IFN signaling downstream by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (binding karyopherin alpha1). Together, VP35 and VP24 create a comprehensive block of innate immunity.",

      "options": ["A quasispecies is a cloud of genetically diverse but related viral variants generated by error-prone RNA replication, centered around a master sequence; this diversity provides a reservoir of pre-existing variants including drug-resistant mutants, meaning that monotherapy with a single antiviral drug rapidly selects for resistance, necessitating combination therapy targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously", "A quasispecies is a single viral genotype that remains unchanged during infection", "Quasispecies theory applies only to DNA viruses with high-fidelity replication", "A quasispecies consists of completely unrelated viruses co-infecting the same host"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viral quasispecies theory, developed by Manfred Eigen and applied to virology by Esteban Domingo, describes the population genetics of rapidly mutating RNA viruses: (1) Error-prone replication: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and reverse transcriptases lack proofreading exonuclease activity. Error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle mean that for a 10 kb genome, essentially every newly synthesized genome contains at least one mutation. (2) Quasispecies structure: The viral population is not a single genotype but a dynamic distribution (cloud) of closely related variants. The distribution is centered on a master sequence (the most fit genotype in the current environment) but contains a vast number of minority variants at lower frequencies. (3) Selection unit: In quasispecies theory, natural selection acts on the entire mutant distribution, not just individual genotypes. The master sequence may not even be the most abundant genotype — the consensus sequence (derived from the most common nucleotide at each position) represents the population average. (4) Implications for antiviral therapy: (a) Pre-existing resistance: Due to the enormous population sizes (10^8-10^12 virions per patient for HIV, HCV) and high mutation rates, drug-resistant variants pre-exist at low frequency BEFORE drug treatment begins. For HIV, any single point mutation conferring drug resistance exists in the quasispecies at ~10^4-10^5 copies. (b) Rapid resistance emergence: Under monotherapy, resistant variants are rapidly selected, becoming the dominant population within days to weeks. (c) Combination therapy: Targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously (HAART for HIV: 2 NRTIs + integrase inhibitor; Harvoni for HCV: sofosbuvir + ledipasvir) requires multiple simultaneous resistance mutations to emerge, which is probabilistically extremely unlikely (~10^-10 x 10^-10 = 10^-20 for two independent mutations). (5) Error catastrophe: If the mutation rate exceeds a threshold (error threshold), the quasispecies cannot maintain genetic information and collapses. Mutagenic drugs (ribavirin, favipiravir, molnupiravir) exploit this principle by increasing the mutation rate above the error threshold — a strategy called lethal mutagenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The spot assay is the standard rapid method for determining phage host range: (1) Method: Each bacterial strain is grown to log phase in liquid culture. A thin layer of soft agar containing each strain is poured as a lawn on individual plates (or sectors of a single plate). Small volumes (5-10 uL) of serial dilutions of the phage lysate are spotted onto each lawn. Plates are incubated overnight. (2) Interpretation: Clear zone (zone of lysis): The phage can infect and lyse this bacterial strain. The zone may show individual plaques at low phage concentration or confluent lysis at high concentration. No clearing: The strain is resistant. Resistance can be due to: lack of the phage receptor on the bacterial surface, restriction-modification systems that degrade injected phage DNA, CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity targeting the phage, superinfection immunity (if the strain is a lysogen of a related phage), or abortive infection systems. Turbid clearing: The phage may be temperate (capable of lysogeny), producing turbid plaques due to immune lysogens growing within the plaque. (3) Efficiency of plating (EOP): For quantitative host range analysis, plaque counts on each susceptible strain are compared to the reference host. EOP = (plaques on test strain) / (plaques on reference host). EOP of 1.0 = equally efficient, <0.1 = restricted, >1.0 = the test strain is more permissive.

      "question": "HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to cure. What maintains the latent provirus in a transcriptionally silent state?",
      "options": ["In resting CD4+ T cells, the integrated HIV provirus is silenced by multiple epigenetic mechanisms: the 5' LTR promoter is associated with repressive chromatin (hypoacetylated histones, positioned nucleosome nuc-1 over the TSS), lacks active host transcription factors (NF-kB and NFAT are sequestered in the cytoplasm), and the absence of P-TEFb prevents Tat-mediated transcriptional elongation", "Latent HIV proviruses are deleted from the host genome and must re-integrate upon reactivation", "HIV latency is maintained solely by the absence of the viral Rev protein", "Latent proviruses continuously produce low levels of virus that are immediately neutralized by antibodies"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 latency is maintained by multiple reinforcing mechanisms at the transcriptional level: (1) Chromatin-based repression: The integrated provirus at the 5' LTR promoter has two positioned nucleosomes: nuc-0 (upstream) and nuc-1 (positioned directly over the transcription start site). In latency, nuc-1 is hypoacetylated and carries repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3) are recruited to the LTR by host transcription factors YY1, LSF, and CBF-1 (the Notch pathway effector that recruits the corepressor complex). (2) Transcription factor absence: In resting CD4+ T cells: NF-kB (p65/p50): sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkBα. The HIV LTR contains two NF-kB binding sites essential for efficient transcription. NFAT: also cytoplasmic, requires calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for nuclear entry. AP-1: not active in resting cells. Without these inducible transcription factors, basal LTR transcription is extremely low. (3) P-TEFb sequestration: In resting T cells, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T1) is sequestered in an inactive complex with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. Without active P-TEFb, even if RNA Pol II initiates at the LTR, it pauses at the TAR (transactivation response) element and cannot transition to productive elongation. The viral Tat protein normally recruits P-TEFb to TAR, but Tat levels are zero or minimal in latently infected cells (a chicken-and-egg problem). (4) DNA methylation: CpG dinucleotides in the LTR can become methylated, contributing to long-term silencing. (5) Latency reversal: T cell activation (antigen stimulation, PMA/ionomycin) activates NF-kB, NFAT, and P-TEFb, reactivating the provirus. 'Shock and kill' strategies use latency-reversing agents (LRAs) like HDAC inhibitors (SAHA, romidepsin), PKC agonists (bryostatin, prostratin), or BET inhibitors to reactivate latent proviruses, exposing them to immune clearance or antiretroviral drugs.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: HSV-1 ICP47 (Infected Cell Protein 47) is a small (88 aa) immediate-early protein that binds the TAP transporter (TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer) in the ER membrane. TAP normally translocates proteasome-generated peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. ICP47 blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP from the cytoplasmic side, preventing peptide translocation. Without peptide loading, MHC class I molecules are retained in the ER (empty/peptide-receptive MHC I is unstable) and do not reach the cell surface. This renders HSV-infected cells invisible to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. S2 TRUE: Adenovirus E1A binds p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein), which are essential coactivators for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. By sequestering p300/CBP, E1A reduces histone acetylation at ISG promoters and blocks the ISGF3 (STAT1-STAT2-IRF9) complex from activating ISGs. E1A also blocks STAT1 signaling. S3 TRUE: Vaccinia virus (and other poxviruses) encode multiple secreted proteins that mimic host cytokine receptors. These viroceptors act as molecular sponges: viral TNF receptor homologs (CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, CrmE) bind and neutralize TNF-alpha, preventing its pro-inflammatory signaling. Viral IL-1 receptor homolog (B15R) binds IL-1beta. Viral IFN-alpha/beta receptor homolog (B18R/B19R) binds and neutralizes type I interferons. This is possible because poxviruses have large genomes (130-375 kb) capable of encoding many immune evasion proteins. S4 FALSE: Influenza NS1 (Non-Structural protein 1) is a potent innate immune antagonist with multiple functions: binds dsRNA (preventing RIG-I activation), inhibits the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 (required for RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination and signaling), blocks CPSF30 (inhibiting 3' processing of host mRNAs including IFN mRNA), and inhibits PKR activation.

      "options": ["TMV has a rigid helical rod structure (~300 nm x 18 nm) composed of ~2,130 identical coat protein (CP) subunits arranged in a helix around a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome; assembly initiates when a 20S aggregate (two-turn disk) of CP recognizes a specific origin of assembly sequence (OAS) in the RNA, and elongation proceeds bidirectionally as additional CP subunits add in a 5'-to-3' and 3'-to-5' direction", "TMV has an icosahedral capsid with 60 identical subunits", "TMV assembly requires host chaperone proteins and ATP hydrolysis", "TMV has a lipid envelope surrounding a helical nucleocapsid"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TMV is the paradigm for understanding helical virus assembly: (1) Structure: TMV is a non-enveloped, rigid rod 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, with a 4 nm central channel. The capsid consists of approximately 2,130 copies of a single 17.5 kDa coat protein (CP) subunit arranged in a right-handed helix with 16.3 subunits per turn and a pitch of 2.3 nm. The ssRNA genome (6,395 nt) is embedded between protein subunits in a helical groove, with 3 nucleotides per CP subunit. (2) Assembly initiation: CP subunits self-associate into various aggregates depending on pH and ionic conditions. At neutral pH, the predominant form is the 20S aggregate — a two-layer disk of 34 subunits. The 20S disk recognizes and binds the Origin of Assembly Sequence (OAS, also called the packaging signal), a specific hairpin loop structure located approximately 900 nt from the 3' end of the RNA (within the gene encoding the movement protein). The RNA threads through the central hole of the disk and inserts between the two layers, which then convert (jaws mechanism) from a flat disk to a short helix (the lock-washer form). (3) Elongation: Additional CP subunits (as disks or smaller aggregates) add to the growing helix. Elongation in the 5' direction is rapid because the RNA loop is pulled through the central channel, progressively incorporating more RNA. Elongation in the 3' direction is slower and may involve addition of individual CP monomers. (4) Thermodynamic principles: CP-CP and CP-RNA interactions are both important. RNA is NOT required for helix formation (CP alone forms helical rods in vitro at low pH), but RNA dramatically accelerates and nucleates assembly under physiological conditions. The OAS ensures that TMV RNA is preferentially packaged over host RNAs. (5) Historical significance: Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat (1955) demonstrated that purified TMV RNA alone was infectious (confirming RNA as the genetic material of TMV), and reconstitution of infectious virions from purified RNA and CP subunits showed that self-assembly requires no host machinery.",

      "options": ["During adaptation, the Cas1-Cas2 complex captures short protospacer sequences from the invading phage DNA and integrates them as new spacers into the CRISPR array; during interference, the CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into crRNAs that pair with tracrRNA and guide the Cas9 endonuclease to complementary sequences in the phage genome, where Cas9 generates a double-strand break adjacent to a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence", "CRISPR-Cas9 recognizes phage proteins rather than nucleic acids", "The CRISPR array is pre-programmed at birth and cannot incorporate new sequences", "Cas9 functions as an RNA polymerase that produces antiviral RNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system operates in three stages: (1) Adaptation (spacer acquisition): When a new phage infects the cell, the Cas1-Cas2 complex (Cas1 is an integrase, Cas2 is a structural scaffold) selects a ~30 bp segment (protospacer) from the phage DNA. Protospacer selection requires the presence of a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif, typically 5'-NGG-3' for S. pyogenes Cas9) flanking the protospacer. The selected protospacer is integrated at the leader end (5' end) of the CRISPR array, between the leader sequence and the first existing repeat. The repeat is duplicated in the process, creating: leader-new spacer-repeat-old spacer-repeat. This creates a chronological record of past infections. (2) Expression (crRNA biogenesis): The entire CRISPR array is transcribed as a single long pre-crRNA. A trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), encoded elsewhere in the CRISPR locus, has a region complementary to the repeat sequences and base-pairs with pre-crRNA. RNase III (host enzyme) processes the pre-crRNA:tracrRNA duplex into individual crRNA:tracrRNA units. Each mature crRNA:tracrRNA guide contains: the spacer sequence (20 nt complementary to the phage target) and the tracrRNA (which interacts with Cas9). (3) Interference (target cleavage): The Cas9 protein binds the crRNA:tracrRNA guide. Cas9 scans incoming DNA for PAM sequences (PAM recognition is the first step and occurs through protein-DNA contacts, not base-pairing). Upon finding a PAM, Cas9 locally unwinds the DNA and tests for complementarity with the crRNA spacer through Watson-Crick base-pairing (R-loop formation). If complementarity extends through the seed region (10-12 nt proximal to PAM), Cas9 undergoes a conformational change activating both nuclease domains: RuvC cleaves the non-target strand, HNH cleaves the target strand, creating a blunt-ended DSB 3 bp upstream of the PAM. (4) Self vs. non-self: The PAM sequence prevents self-targeting: the spacer in the CRISPR array lacks the PAM (the PAM is only present in the phage DNA flanking the protospacer). If the PAM is mutated or absent, Cas9 cannot bind and cleave. (5) Phage counter-defense: Phages evolve anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems by blocking DNA binding, preventing Cas protein loading, or degrading crRNAs.",

      "options": ["Viroids replicate entirely using host enzymes: nuclear viroids (like PSTVd) hijack host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II to synthesize complementary RNA from the viroid RNA template through rolling circle replication, producing multimeric linear intermediates that are cleaved by either host RNase or the viroid's own hammerhead ribozyme (in chloroplastic viroids) and ligated into circular monomers", "Viroids encode a small RNA polymerase within their circular RNA structure", "Viroids replicate through reverse transcription and integration like retroviruses", "Viroids do not replicate and are transmitted only as pre-formed molecules from parent to offspring"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viroids are remarkable in their ability to replicate using solely host machinery: (1) Structure: Viroids are small (246-401 nt) circular ssRNA molecules with extensive intramolecular base-pairing forming a rod-like or branched secondary structure. They contain NO open reading frames and encode NO proteins. (2) Two families: Pospiviroidae (nuclear viroids, type species: Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid, PSTVd): replicate in the nucleus. Avsunviroidae (chloroplastic viroids, type species: Avocado Sunblotch Viroid, ASBVd): replicate in chloroplasts. (3) Nuclear viroid replication (asymmetric rolling circle): The plus-strand circular viroid RNA enters the nucleus. Host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II (normally transcribes DNA → mRNA) is redirected to use the viroid RNA as template (an aberrant template usage). Pol II initiates at a specific site and continuously copies the circular template (rolling circle mechanism), producing long concatemeric minus-strand RNA. The minus-strand concatemer serves as template for another round of Pol II transcription, producing concatemeric plus-strand RNA. The concatemers are cleaved into unit-length monomers by an unknown host RNase (likely RNase III-like activity recognizing specific structural elements). Monomeric linear RNAs are circularized by host tRNA ligase. (4) Chloroplastic viroid replication (symmetric rolling circle): Both plus and minus strands serve as templates (using a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, NEP). Both plus and minus concatemers are self-cleaved by embedded hammerhead ribozyme motifs — catalytic RNAs that self-cleave through a transesterification reaction requiring a specific tertiary structure and divalent metal ion. Monomers are ligated by host chloroplastic tRNA ligase. (5) Pathogenesis: Viroids cause disease through RNA silencing: viroid RNA is processed by host Dicer into viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) that enter the RISC complex and silence host genes with complementary sequences, causing developmental abnormalities. (6) Significance: Viroids may represent relics of the RNA World — self-replicating RNA molecules that predate the evolution of proteins.",

      "options": ["The lambda CI repressor (encoded by the cI gene) binds cooperatively to the OL and OR operator regions, repressing the pL and pR promoters that drive early lytic gene expression; during induction by DNA damage, the bacterial RecA protein becomes activated as a coprotease that stimulates CI repressor autocleavage, destroying the repressor and allowing transcription from pL and pR to initiate the lytic program", "The prophage DNA is methylated by host Dam methylase preventing all transcription", "Host sigma-70 factor cannot recognize phage promoters while the phage is integrated", "The prophage is excised from the chromosome during lysogeny to prevent lytic gene expression"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Lambda lysogeny maintenance and induction: (1) The CI repressor is the key molecular switch. CI binds as dimers to the OL (operators left) and OR (operators right) regions. OR contains three binding sites: OR1, OR2, OR3. CI binds cooperatively: first to OR1 (highest affinity), then OR2, blocking RNA polymerase access to pR (rightward promoter for lytic genes like cro). CI bound at OR2 simultaneously activates its own transcription from pRM (promoter for repressor maintenance), creating a positive autoregulatory loop. At OL, CI similarly represses pL (leftward promoter for N gene and recombination functions). (2) CI dimers at OL and OR interact via DNA looping (long-range cooperativity), creating an octameric CI complex that further stabilizes repression. (3) At high CI concentrations, OR3 becomes occupied, which represses pRM — a negative autoregulatory mechanism preventing CI overaccumulation. (4) During SOS response (triggered by DNA damage from UV, mitomycin C, etc.): RecA protein binds to ssDNA gaps at stalled replication forks, forming RecA-ssDNA filaments (activated RecA*). RecA* stimulates the latent autocleavage activity of CI repressor. CI undergoes self-cleavage between Ala111 and Gly112 in the flexible linker connecting the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerization domain. (5) Cleaved CI can no longer dimerize or bind DNA cooperatively, and repression collapses rapidly (positive feedback: loss of CI at OR2 reduces pRM transcription). (6) With pR and pL derepressed: Cro protein is made from pR; Cro binds preferentially to OR3, preventing any residual CI expression. The N antitermination protein allows read-through of terminators. The Q antitermination protein activates late gene transcription (head, tail, lysis). (7) Excision: Int + Xis proteins catalyze prophage excision via site-specific recombination at attL and attR. (8) Lytic program: DNA replication (bidirectional then rolling circle), virion assembly, and host cell lysis (holin-endolysin system).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Calculating phage titer from plaque assay data: (1) The plaque assay is the standard method for quantifying infectious virus particles. Each plaque represents a zone of lysis initiated by a single infectious phage particle (assuming the Poisson distribution and that the multiplicity of infection is low enough that each plaque arises from one phage). (2) The formula for titer calculation: Titer (PFU/mL) = Number of plaques / (Dilution factor x Volume plated in mL). (3) Given data: 42 plaques counted, dilution = 10^-6, volume = 0.1 mL. (4) Calculation: Titer = 42 / (10^-6 x 0.1) = 42 / (10^-7) = 42 x 10^7 = 4.2 x 10^8 PFU/mL. (5) Key assumptions: Each plaque arose from exactly one phage (valid when dilution is sufficient); all viable phages formed visible plaques (some may be too small or turbid); the bacterial lawn was uniformly distributed; the volume was accurately measured. (6) Why PFU/mL and not particles/mL: The plaque assay only counts infectious particles. The actual number of phage particles (measured by electron microscopy or spectrophotometry) may be 10-1000 times higher due to the particle-to-PFU ratio — many particles may be defective, damaged, or unable to adsorb. (7) Statistical considerations: Reliable counts come from plates with 30-300 plaques (too few = high statistical error; too many = overlapping plaques undercount). The 42 plaques here are within this ideal range. (8) Plaque morphology: Clear plaques indicate fully lytic phages; turbid plaques suggest temperate phages where some bacteria in the plaque center have become lysogenic and are immune to superinfection.",

      "options": ["After membrane fusion mediated by gp41, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed in the cytoplasm using tRNA-Lys3 as a primer; reverse transcriptase synthesizes minus-strand DNA with concurrent RNase H degradation of the RNA template, then synthesizes plus-strand DNA using a polypurine tract primer, producing linear dsDNA with long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends; the pre-integration complex enters the nucleus through nuclear pores (using integrase and LEDGF/p75 host factor), and integrase catalyzes 3'-processing of LTR ends followed by strand transfer to insert the viral DNA into host chromosomal DNA", "The RNA genome is directly integrated into host DNA by a ribozyme", "Reverse transcription occurs in the nucleus after the RNA genome is imported through nuclear pores", "The viral DNA remains episomal and does not integrate into host chromosomes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcription and integration: (1) Entry: HIV-1 gp120 binds CD4 receptor on T cells, triggering conformational change exposing the coreceptor binding site. Gp120 then binds CCR5 (macrophage-tropic) or CXCR4 (T-cell tropic) coreceptors. This triggers gp41 conformational change: the fusion peptide inserts into the host membrane, and the six-helix bundle forms, pulling viral and host membranes together for fusion. (2) Uncoating: The viral core (capsid cone) enters the cytoplasm. Capsid uncoating is now understood to be gradual and linked to reverse transcription and nuclear import (not immediate). (3) Reverse transcription (in the reverse transcription complex, RTC): Step 1 — tRNA-Lys3 (packaged from the host cell) anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the genomic RNA. RT synthesizes minus-strand strong-stop DNA (-sssDNA) by copying the 5' end: R region + U5. Step 2 — RNase H activity of RT degrades the RNA in the RNA:DNA hybrid at the 5' end. Step 3 — First strand transfer: -sssDNA jumps to the 3' end of the same or the other RNA copy (template switching), annealing via the R region complementarity. Step 4 — RT continues minus-strand DNA synthesis toward the 5' end of the RNA template. RNase H concurrently degrades the RNA template but leaves the polypurine tract (PPT, a purine-rich RNase H-resistant sequence). Step 5 — The PPT serves as primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. RT synthesizes plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA), copying: U3-R-U5-PBS (including tRNA primer). Step 6 — RNase H removes the tRNA primer and the PPT. Step 7 — Second strand transfer: +sssDNA anneals to the minus strand via PBS complementarity. Step 8 — Both strands are completed, resulting in linear dsDNA flanked by LTRs (U3-R-U5 at each end). The LTRs were generated by the two strand transfers. (4) Nuclear import: The pre-integration complex (PIC) containing the viral dsDNA, integrase, capsid, and host factors (including LEDGF/p75) is transported through nuclear pores. HIV can infect non-dividing cells because its PIC actively traverses intact nuclear pores (unlike gammaretroviruses like MLV, which require mitosis). (5) Integration: Integrase (IN) catalyzes: 3'-processing — removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end of the LTRs, exposing reactive CA-3'OH groups. Strand transfer — IN creates staggered cuts in host DNA (5 bp apart for HIV) and joins each viral 3' end to a host 5' phosphate. Host DNA repair enzymes fill in the gaps and ligate, creating the characteristic 5 bp target site duplication (TSD) flanking the provirus. LEDGF/p75 tethers IN to chromatin and biases integration toward active transcription units.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Determining viral RNA genome sense (polarity): (1) The key principle: Positive-sense (+) RNA has the same polarity as mRNA and can be directly translated by ribosomes. Negative-sense (-) RNA is complementary to mRNA and must first be copied into mRNA by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) before translation. (2) The infectivity assay: If purified genomic RNA alone (naked RNA, no proteins) is introduced into susceptible cells and produces progeny virus, the genome must be positive-sense. This is because: The (+) RNA can immediately be translated by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including the RdRp needed for replication. No pre-existing viral proteins are needed to initiate infection. (3) For negative-sense viruses: Purified (-) RNA alone is NOT infectious because host cells lack RdRp — they have no enzyme that can copy RNA from an RNA template. The virion must carry its own RdRp (packaged during assembly). If purified (-) RNA is co-transfected with purified viral RdRp, infectivity is restored. (4) Protoplasts (plant cells enzymatically stripped of cell walls) are used because: Plant cells have rigid cell walls that block naked RNA entry. Protoplasts can take up RNA through PEG-mediated or electroporation methods. (5) Controls: Positive control: intact virus particles (should be infectious). Negative control: RNA treated with RNase before transfection (should be non-infectious). Mock transfection: buffer only. (6) Important caveats: Some (+) RNA viruses (like retroviruses) require reverse transcriptase packaged in the virion, so naked RNA would not be infectious despite being (+) sense. Ambisense viruses (some bunyaviruses) have both (+) and (-) regions on the same segment, complicating interpretation. dsRNA viruses: naked dsRNA is not infectious because the (+) strand cannot be released from the dsRNA duplex without viral proteins. (7) Alternative approaches: In vitro translation: (+) RNA will produce proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract; (-) RNA will not. Hybridization with mRNA: (+) genomic RNA will not hybridize with mRNA (same polarity); (-) genomic RNA will hybridize with mRNA (complementary).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HPV-mediated oncogenesis: (1) HPV is a small (~8 kb) dsDNA virus that infects basal keratinocytes of stratified squamous epithelia, entering through micro-wounds. (2) Early genes E6 and E7 are the primary oncoproteins. In low-risk HPV types (6, 11), E6 and E7 have weak transforming activity. In high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45), E6 and E7 have significantly stronger activity. (3) E7 protein mechanism: E7 binds pRb (retinoblastoma protein) through an LXCXE motif in the CR2 domain. This binding displaces E2F transcription factors from the pRb-E2F repressive complex. Free E2F activates transcription of S-phase genes (cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase). E7 also targets pRb for proteasomal degradation via cullin-2 ubiquitin ligase. Additionally, E7 binds and inactivates p21 and p27 CDK inhibitors, and disrupts HDAC complexes. (4) E6 protein mechanism: E6 binds the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP (E6-Associated Protein, also called UBE3A). The E6-E6AP complex acts as a neo-E3 ligase that recruits p53. E6AP ubiquitinates p53, targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. p53 is normally stabilized in response to DNA damage; its degradation eliminates the key checkpoint response. E6 also activates telomerase (hTERT) by inducing hTERT transcription, contributing to cellular immortalization. E6 additionally degrades PDZ domain proteins involved in cell polarity and growth control. (5) Viral integration: In high-risk HPV cancers, the viral DNA often integrates into host chromosomes. Integration frequently disrupts the E2 gene (E2 normally represses E6/E7 transcription). Loss of E2 leads to overexpression of E6 and E7. Integration is a critical step from low-grade to high-grade lesion progression. (6) Multi-step carcinogenesis: Initial HPV infection → persistent infection (immune evasion) → E6/E7 overexpression → p53/pRb inactivation → genomic instability (centrosome amplification, chromosomal aberrations) → accumulation of additional mutations → invasive carcinoma. This process typically takes 10-20 years. (7) This mechanism differs from acute transforming retroviruses (like RSV carrying v-src), which transform through viral oncogene expression. HPV transforms by inactivating tumor suppressors rather than activating oncogenes.",

      "options": ["In generalized transduction, any segment of host DNA can be accidentally packaged into a phage head when the pac site-based DNA packaging system mistakenly recognizes host DNA sequences; in specialized transduction, only host genes immediately flanking the prophage integration site (attB) are transferred when imprecise excision of the prophage generates a defective phage genome carrying adjacent chromosomal DNA", "Generalized transduction only transfers plasmid DNA while specialized transduction transfers chromosomal DNA", "Both types transfer the same genes but generalized transduction uses P1 phage and specialized uses lambda", "Generalized transduction requires conjugation pili while specialized transduction uses phage injection"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Transduction mechanisms: (1) Generalized transduction: Occurs during the lytic cycle of certain phages (e.g., P1, P22 in Salmonella). During normal lytic development, the phage degrades host DNA to nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis. However, host DNA is not completely degraded before packaging begins. DNA packaging in phages like P1 uses a 'headful' mechanism: the terminase complex recognizes a pac (packaging) site on concatemeric phage DNA, makes a cut, and threads DNA into the empty prohead until it is full (~110 kb for P1). Occasionally (~1 in 10^5 to 10^7 phage), the terminase mistakenly recognizes a pseudo-pac sequence in the host chromosome. A headful of host DNA (~90-110 kb) is packaged into the phage head. This transducing particle contains ONLY host DNA — no phage DNA. It can inject this DNA into a new host cell, where it can recombine with the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination (RecA-dependent). Any host gene has an approximately equal probability of being transduced (hence 'generalized'), though some regions near pseudo-pac sites may be slightly overrepresented. (2) Specialized transduction: Occurs with temperate phages that integrate at specific sites (e.g., lambda at attB between gal and bio operons). During lysogenic induction, prophage excision normally occurs by precise reciprocal recombination between attL and attR (catalyzed by Int + Xis). Rarely (~1 in 10^6), aberrant excision occurs: recombination happens between sequences flanking attL and attR rather than within them. This generates a defective phage genome that has lost some phage genes but gained adjacent host genes. For lambda: excision to the left captures gal genes (λdgal = lambda defective gal-transducing). Excision to the right captures bio genes (λdbio). The transducing phage is defective (cannot complete lytic cycle alone) and requires a helper phage for replication and packaging. Only genes adjacent to the integration site can be transduced (hence 'specialized'). (3) Practical implications: Generalized transduction is used for genetic mapping (cotransduction frequency indicates gene proximity, analogous to linkage analysis). Specialized transduction was used to clone genes (phage lambda vectors) and for fine-structure mapping of gene regulation.",

      "correctAnswer": "T, T, F, T",
      "explanation": "Analyzing each statement about Baltimore classification groups: S1 is TRUE: dsRNA viruses (Group III, e.g., Reoviridae including rotaviruses) face a unique challenge. dsRNA cannot be directly translated — ribosomes require ssRNA. Moreover, host cells have no enzymes that can transcribe RNA from an RNA template. Therefore, dsRNA viruses must package their own RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) within the virion. Upon entry, the RdRp transcribes the minus strand of each dsRNA segment into (+) mRNA, which exits the core particle for translation. Replication occurs within the intact core particle (a 'conservative' mechanism) — the dsRNA genome never becomes fully exposed in the cytoplasm, which prevents activation of innate immune sensors like RIG-I and MDA5 that detect cytoplasmic dsRNA. S2 is TRUE: Group IV (+) ssRNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses) have genomes with the same polarity as mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly recognized by host ribosomes. For picornaviruses, the 5' end has a VPg protein (not a cap) and an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) that recruits ribosomes cap-independently. For coronaviruses, the 5' end is capped. The first proteins translated include the RdRp complex (replicase), which then replicates the genome. This is why purified (+) RNA is infectious — it is self-sufficient to initiate the replication cycle. S3 is FALSE: Most Group V (-) ssRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. Paramyxoviruses (measles, Sendai), Rhabdoviruses (rabies, VSV), and Filoviruses (Ebola) all replicate in the cytoplasm. They carry their own RdRp (L protein + P/VP35 cofactor) and do not require host splicing machinery. The exceptions are Orthomyxoviruses (influenza), which replicate in the nucleus because they use a unique 'cap-snatching' mechanism: the viral endonuclease steals 5' caps from host pre-mRNAs to prime viral mRNA synthesis, and their segmented genome requires nuclear splicing for some transcripts (M and NS segments). Bornaviruses also replicate in the nucleus. But the statement says 'exclusively in the nucleus' for all Group V, which is false. S4 is TRUE: Retroviruses (Group VI, e.g., HIV, MLV) carry (+) ssRNA genomes and package reverse transcriptase (RT). Upon entry, RT converts the RNA to dsDNA through the complex reverse transcription process involving two strand transfers. The viral dsDNA is flanked by LTRs and is integrated into host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme. Once integrated (as a 'provirus'), the viral DNA is transcribed by host RNA Polymerase II from the LTR promoter, producing both mRNAs for protein synthesis and full-length genomic RNA for packaging into new virions.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The holin-endolysin lysis system: (1) Endolysins: These are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes synthesized in the cytoplasm. They accumulate in a fully active form in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. They cannot access their substrate (peptidoglycan in the periplasm/cell wall) because the intact inner membrane is impermeable to proteins. Endolysins lack signal peptides and are NOT secreted by the Sec or Tat pathways. Different phages encode endolysins with different specificities: lysozymes (cleave beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds between NAG and NAM), transglycosylases, amidases (cleave MurNAc-L-Ala bond), or endopeptidases (cleave peptide cross-links). (2) Holins: Small hydrophobic proteins (typically 100-150 amino acids) that accumulate in the inner membrane. They contain at least one transmembrane domain. During the latent period, holins exist as dimers and small oligomers in the membrane, maintained by the proton motive force (PMF). The holin allele determines the precise timing of lysis (the 'lysis clock'). At the genetically programmed time (typically 45-60 min for T4, adjustable by mutations): holins suddenly undergo a phase transition — they aggregate into large two-dimensional raft structures forming micron-scale holes in the inner membrane. This is an all-or-nothing event occurring within seconds. (3) Lysis cascade: Holin triggering collapses the PMF. The massive membrane lesions allow endolysin to flood into the periplasm. Endolysin rapidly degrades peptidoglycan. Loss of cell wall integrity + internal turgor pressure → osmotic lysis → release of ~100-200 progeny phage. (4) Antiholin: Many phages also encode an antiholin — a holin variant with an extra transmembrane segment that acts as a negative regulator. Antiholin forms heterodimers with holin, delaying the triggering event. The ratio of holin:antiholin tunes lysis timing. (5) Spanins: In Gram-negative bacteria, an additional component is needed: spanins (inner membrane and outer membrane spanning proteins) that disrupt the outer membrane. Without spanins, cells form spheroplasts but don't fully lyse. (6) Evolutionary optimization: The lysis timing represents a trade-off — earlier lysis releases fewer (but some) phage; later lysis allows more phage to be assembled but risks host death from other causes.

      "question": "Phage display is a powerful technique that links a protein's phenotype to its genotype. How does filamentous phage display work, and why is it useful for identifying high-affinity antibody fragments?",
      "options": ["Foreign DNA encoding a peptide or protein domain is fused in-frame to a gene encoding a phage coat protein (typically gene III encoding pIII of M13 filamentous phage); the fusion protein is displayed on the phage surface while the encoding DNA is packaged inside, allowing iterative rounds of binding selection (biopanning) against an immobilized target, washing to remove non-binders, elution of bound phages, and re-amplification to enrich for phages displaying the highest-affinity variants", "Phage display involves injecting purified antibodies into phage particles for delivery", "The technique requires lytic phages that lyse cells to release the displayed proteins", "Phage display only works with intact immunoglobulins and cannot display peptide fragments"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phage display technology: (1) The system: Filamentous phages (M13, fd, f1) are non-lytic phages that infect F+ E. coli through the F pilus. They are long (~900 nm) flexible rods with a circular ssDNA genome (~6.4 kb) enclosed in ~2700 copies of the major coat protein pVIII and 5 copies each of pIII, pVI, pVII, and pIX at the tips. (2) Display principle: A gene encoding a peptide, protein domain, or antibody fragment (scFv or Fab) is fused to gene III (encoding pIII). pIII is the minor coat protein at one tip of the phage (5 copies). The fusion protein is expressed during phage assembly and incorporated into the phage particle. Each phage displays the foreign protein on its surface AND carries the DNA encoding it inside — this physical linkage of phenotype and genotype is the key feature. (3) Library construction: Massive combinatorial libraries (10^8 to 10^11 unique variants) can be created. For antibody libraries: the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains are randomly combined and displayed as scFv (single-chain variable fragments, VH-linker-VL). Random peptide libraries: oligonucleotide synthesis with randomized codons (NNK or NNS codon schemes). (4) Biopanning: Round 1: The phage library is incubated with the target molecule (antigen, receptor, etc.) immobilized on a surface (plate, beads, or column). Unbound phages are washed away. Bound phages are eluted (acid elution, competitive elution, or enzymatic cleavage). Round 2-4: Eluted phages infect E. coli, amplify, and produce a new phage pool enriched for target binders. This pool undergoes another round of selection with increased stringency. After 3-5 rounds, individual clones are tested for binding (ELISA) and sequenced. (5) Why it works for antibodies: The immune system naturally uses a similar process (somatic hypermutation + clonal selection). Phage display recapitulates this in vitro. Advantages over hybridoma technology: no animal immunization needed, can select against self-antigens (no tolerance), can select under non-physiological conditions, and human antibody fragments are obtained directly. (6) Applications: Drug discovery (adalimumab — first fully human antibody drug, developed via phage display, approved 2002), epitope mapping, enzyme engineering, receptor-ligand identification. George Smith and Gregory Winter shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing phage display and using it for directed antibody evolution.",

      "question": "An experiment tracking influenza virus evolution during serial passage in eggs shows that after 20 passages, the virus has accumulated mutations at positions 226 and 228 of the hemagglutinin receptor binding site, switching its binding preference from alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid to alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. What is the most significant implication of this observation?",
      "options": ["These mutations represent the molecular basis for potential avian-to-human host switching, as human upper respiratory tract epithelial cells predominantly display alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids while avian intestinal epithelial cells display alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids; the ease of acquiring these mutations through serial passage suggests a relatively low genetic barrier for zoonotic transmission", "The mutations indicate the virus has become attenuated and safer for vaccine production", "This switching only affects binding to chicken embryo cells and has no relevance to human infection", "The alpha-2,6 binding preference makes the virus unable to replicate in mammals"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hemagglutinin receptor specificity and pandemic potential: (1) Sialic acid linkage specificity: Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds sialic acid (Neu5Ac) on host cell surface glycoproteins/glycolipids. The linkage between sialic acid and the underlying galactose determines host tropism. Alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids: predominant in avian intestinal epithelium (the primary infection site for avian influenza) and in human lower respiratory tract (deep lung alveoli). Alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids: predominant in human upper respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, nasal epithelium) — the primary site for efficient human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets. (2) Key residues 226 and 228: In H2 and H3 subtypes, amino acids at positions 226 and 228 of HA (using H3 numbering) are critical determinants of receptor specificity. Avian preference (alpha-2,3): Q226 + G228. Human preference (alpha-2,6): L226 + S228. These are the exact mutations observed in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic viruses that switched from avian to human receptor preference. In H1 subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic), different residues are involved (D190/D225). (3) Structural basis: Position 226 is in the 220-loop of the HA receptor binding pocket. Leucine at 226 (hydrophobic) creates a narrower binding pocket that accommodates the more linear alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. Glutamine at 226 (hydrophilic) creates a wider pocket that accommodates the kinked alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. Serine at 228 forms hydrogen bonds that stabilize the alpha-2,6 interaction. (4) Pandemic implications: The observation that only 2 amino acid changes can switch receptor preference suggests a low genetic barrier for avian influenza viruses to acquire human-transmissible properties. This is why H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza are closely monitored — they are highly pathogenic in humans but currently lack efficient human-to-human airborne transmission. Controversial 'gain-of-function' studies (Fouchier 2012, Kawaoka 2012) showed that as few as 4-5 mutations in H5N1 HA could enable airborne transmission in ferrets. (5) The serial passage experiment demonstrates directed evolution in action — each passage selects for variants better adapted to the new host cell receptor landscape.",

      "question": "Restriction-modification (R-M) systems serve as a primitive immune defense in bacteria against phage infection. How does a Type II restriction-modification system protect bacteria while avoiding self-destruction?",
      "options": ["The R-M system consists of two enzymes with the same DNA sequence specificity: a restriction endonuclease that cleaves unmethylated foreign DNA at palindromic recognition sites, and a methyltransferase that adds methyl groups to the same recognition sites in the host's own DNA, protecting it from cleavage; phage DNA entering the cell is unmethylated at these sites and is rapidly cleaved before the methyltransferase can modify it", "The restriction enzyme only recognizes phage-specific DNA sequences that do not occur in bacterial genomes", "Methylation of phage DNA activates the restriction enzyme to cleave it", "The restriction enzyme is only expressed during phage infection through an inducible promoter"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Type II Restriction-Modification systems: (1) Components: Two separate enzymes — a restriction endonuclease (REase) and a DNA methyltransferase (MTase) — that recognize the same short palindromic DNA sequence (typically 4-8 bp). The REase cuts both strands of dsDNA at or near the recognition site. The MTase adds a methyl group (from S-adenosylmethionine, SAM) to a specific base within the recognition site (typically N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, or N4-methylcytosine). (2) Self vs. non-self discrimination: Host DNA is methylated on both strands at all recognition sites (fully methylated = protected). After DNA replication, newly synthesized strands are hemimethylated (one strand methylated, one unmethylated). The MTase rapidly methylates the new strand before the REase can cleave hemimethylated sites (REases typically cut unmethylated DNA much more efficiently than hemimethylated DNA). Foreign DNA (phage, plasmid from a different strain) enters unmethylated at the recognition sites. The REase cleaves this unmethylated DNA rapidly (typically within minutes of entry). The kinetic race: MTase and REase compete for unmodified recognition sites, but REase cleaves unmethylated DNA ~100-1000x faster than MTase modifies it, ensuring foreign DNA is destroyed before it can be protected. (3) Phage counter-strategies: Anti-restriction: phage T3/T7 encode an Ocr (Overcome Classical Restriction) protein that mimics DNA and competitively inhibits Type I REases. Base modification: T4 phage replaces cytosine with hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in its DNA, which is not recognized by most REases. HmC is further glucosylated for additional protection. Stimulation of host MTase: some phages encode proteins that activate the host MTase to quickly methylate phage DNA after injection. Acquired methylation: if a phage occasionally escapes restriction (probability ~10^-4 per unmodified site), its DNA becomes methylated and all progeny from that cell are modified and resistant to that R-M system. DNA injection strategy: phages inject DNA slowly, presenting fewer sites at once, reducing the chance of complete restriction. (4) Ecological significance: R-M systems reduce phage infection efficiency by ~10^2 to 10^8 fold depending on the number of recognition sites in the phage genome. They are considered the first line of bacterial antiviral defense (CRISPR-Cas being the adaptive second line). They also serve as 'selfish genetic elements' — loss of the R-M system genes leads to cell death because unmethylated chromosomal DNA is cleaved by residual REase ('post-segregational killing').",

      "options": ["First, sequence the viral genome and perform phylogenetic analysis to identify its closest relatives and predict its receptor binding protein; second, use pseudotyped virus particles bearing the novel virus's surface glycoprotein to test binding and entry into human cell lines expressing candidate receptors; third, assess replication competence in primary human airway epithelial cultures grown at air-liquid interface; fourth, evaluate pathogenesis and transmission in a suitable animal model such as ferrets or hamsters", "Immediately inject the virus into human volunteers to test pathogenicity", "Simply compare the genome sequence to known pandemic viruses using BLAST and make predictions without wet-lab experiments", "Only test the virus in standard Vero cell culture, which is sufficient to assess pandemic risk"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Systematic pandemic risk assessment of a novel virus: (1) Step 1 — Genomic analysis: Full genome sequencing (using Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, or PacBio) to determine the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis places the virus within a known family/genus (e.g., Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae). Identification of the receptor binding protein (RBP) through homology to known viruses (e.g., spike protein for coronaviruses, hemagglutinin for influenza). Prediction of potential receptors using structural modeling (AlphaFold2) and sequence comparison of the receptor binding domain. Analysis of the furin cleavage site (if present), which can enhance pathogenicity (as seen with SARS-CoV-2). (2) Step 2 — Pseudotyped virus entry assays: Pseudotyped viruses (e.g., VSV or lentiviral particles bearing the novel virus's surface glycoprotein) allow safe study of viral entry without handling the novel pathogen at BSL-4. Test entry into human cell lines (HEK293T, A549, Calu-3, Caco-2) engineered to express candidate receptors (ACE2, DPP4, aminopeptidase N, etc.). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure binding affinity to purified human receptors. If no entry is observed into any human cell line, pandemic risk is lower (but not zero — receptor usage could change through mutation). (3) Step 3 — Replication in primary human tissues: Primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures at air-liquid interface (ALI) are the gold standard for respiratory virus assessment. These cultures recapitulate the pseudostratified epithelium with ciliated cells, goblet cells, and club cells. Key measurements: viral replication kinetics (growth curve), tropism (which cell types are infected, determined by immunofluorescence), cytopathic effect, innate immune response (interferon production, ISG expression), and apical vs. basolateral virus release (apical release facilitates respiratory transmission). Primary human intestinal organoids can assess enteric tropism. (4) Step 4 — Animal models: Ferrets are the standard model for respiratory virus transmission (similar respiratory tract anatomy to humans, sneeze reflex, can transmit influenza). Test direct infection (intranasal inoculation), contact transmission (co-housing), and airborne transmission (adjacent cages with airflow). Syrian hamsters are also useful (used extensively for SARS-CoV-2). Humanized mice (expressing human receptors, e.g., hACE2 transgenic mice) for pathogenesis studies. Monitor: disease signs, viral shedding, tissue tropism, immune response, and lethality. (5) Additional assessments: Serological surveys of human populations near the bat colony for evidence of prior spillover. Antigenic characterization to determine if pre-existing immunity exists. Assessment of susceptibility to existing antivirals. (6) Vero cells (Option D) are insufficient because they lack interferon response genes (deletion of type I IFN locus), so they don't recapitulate innate immune responses, and they don't reflect authentic human tissue tropism.",

      "question": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) constitute approximately 8% of the human genome. What is the evolutionary significance of ERVs, and how did they become fixed in the germline?",
      "options": ["ERVs originated from ancient retroviral infections of germline cells (sperm or egg cell precursors); the proviral DNA was vertically transmitted to offspring and accumulated mutations over millions of years that inactivated viral genes, preventing further retrotransposition; some ERV elements have been co-opted (exapted) for essential host functions, such as syncytin proteins derived from ERV envelope genes that are required for placental syncytiotrophoblast fusion in mammals", "ERVs were intentionally inserted into the genome by the host organism for immune defense", "ERVs only represent contamination artifacts from laboratory retroviruses", "ERVs are active retroviruses that regularly produce infectious particles in healthy humans"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Endogenous retroviruses in the human genome: (1) Origin: Over millions of years, retroviruses have occasionally infected germline cells (oocytes, spermatogonia, or early embryonic cells). When a retrovirus integrates its proviral DNA into a germline cell's chromosomal DNA, that provirus can be vertically transmitted to all cells of the resulting organism and to subsequent generations through Mendelian inheritance. (2) Accumulation and inactivation: Once fixed in the germline, ERV sequences are subject to neutral evolutionary forces (genetic drift, mutation). Over time, ERV sequences accumulate point mutations, deletions, and insertions that inactivate their genes: gag (capsid proteins), pol (reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease), and env (envelope glycoprotein). Solo LTRs: Homologous recombination between the two LTRs flanking a provirus can delete the internal viral genes, leaving a single (solo) LTR. There are far more solo LTRs than intact ERVs. The oldest human ERVs (HERVs) date to ~100 million years ago (shared across primate lineages), while the youngest (HERV-K/HML-2) had active members as recently as ~1 million years ago and may still have low-level transcriptional activity. (3) Genomic impact: HERVs constitute ~8% of the human genome (~500,000 HERV-related sequences), compared to only ~1.5% that encodes proteins. ERV LTRs serve as regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers, insulators, and polyadenylation signals for host genes. LTR-driven transcription has been co-opted for tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the placenta, testis, and immune system. (4) Exaptation (co-option) examples: Syncytin-1 (HERV-W env) and Syncytin-2 (HERV-FRD env): These are captured retroviral envelope proteins that are essential for placental development. They mediate cell-cell fusion to form the syncytiotrophoblast — the multinucleated cell layer at the maternal-fetal interface. Different mammalian lineages have independently captured different ERV env genes for this function (convergent exaptation). ARC (Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated protein): A neuronal protein derived from a retroviral Gag polyprotein. ARC forms virus-like capsids that package mRNA and transfer it between neurons, functioning in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. HERV-derived regulatory elements: The innate immune gene network is partially regulated by HERV-derived enhancers that are activated by interferons, suggesting ERVs helped shape the evolution of antiviral immunity. (5) ERVs and disease: Most HERVs are inactive, but aberrant HERV expression has been associated with: autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis — HERV-W and HERV-K), cancers (HERV-K expression in melanoma, breast cancer), and schizophrenia. However, causation (versus correlation) remains debated.",

      "options": ["Mimivirus has a genome of ~1.2 Mb encoding over 900 proteins, including genes for translation-related functions (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation factors), DNA repair enzymes, and metabolic enzymes not found in any other viruses; its particle diameter (~750 nm) exceeds that of some bacteria, and it can itself be infected by smaller virophages (Sputnik), paralleling the virus-host relationship seen in cellular organisms", "Mimivirus can reproduce independently without any host cell", "Mimivirus has a lipid bilayer membrane but no capsid protein", "Mimivirus is simply a large bacterium that was misclassified as a virus"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Giant viruses and the redefinition of viruses: (1) Discovery: Mimivirus (Mimicking microbe virus) was discovered in 1992 in the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga during a pneumonia outbreak investigation in a Bradford, England cooling tower. Initially mistaken for a Gram-positive bacterium due to its size (~750 nm diameter, comparable to Mycoplasma). Identified as a virus in 2003 by Didier Raoult and colleagues. (2) Genome: ~1.18 Mb linear dsDNA genome, encoding ~979 proteins. This is larger than the genomes of many obligate intracellular bacteria (Rickettsia prowazekii: ~1.1 Mb, Mycoplasma genitalium: ~0.58 Mb). Contains genes thought to be exclusive to cellular life: 4 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Arg, Cys, Met, Tyr), translation initiation and elongation factors, tRNA-modifying enzymes, topoisomerase (type IA and II), DNA repair enzymes (MutS mismatch repair, photolyase, nucleotide excision repair components), chaperones (multiple Hsp70/DnaK homologs), polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, and genes for 1-carbon folate metabolism. However, it lacks ribosomes and has incomplete translation machinery — it still requires the host cell's ribosomes for protein synthesis. (3) Particle structure: Icosahedral capsid (~500 nm) surrounded by fibrils (~125 nm long), giving total diameter of ~750 nm. A unique 'stargate' structure — a five-pointed star-shaped structure at one vertex that opens to release the genome during infection. Internal lipid membrane beneath the capsid. (4) Replication: Infects Acanthamoeba through phagocytosis. Establishes a 'viral factory' in the cytoplasm — a large compartment where viral DNA replication and transcription occur, analogous to the nucleus. The viral factory excludes host ribosomes (transcription inside, translation outside — paralleling the nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells). (5) Virophages: Sputnik virophage (discovered 2008) is a small virus (~50 nm, 18 kb genome) that co-infects Acanthamoeba cells along with Mimivirus. Sputnik cannot replicate without Mimivirus — it depends on Mimivirus's viral factory for its replication. Sputnik infection reduces Mimivirus replication efficiency and causes production of abnormal Mimivirus particles. This parasite-of-a-parasite relationship mirrors the virus-host dynamic of cellular life, suggesting Mimivirus occupies an ecological niche more like a cellular organism than a traditional virus. (6) Evolutionary implications: Giant viruses have reignited debate about whether viruses are 'alive.' Three hypotheses for their origin: (a) Genome reduction: giant viruses descended from a fourth domain of cellular life that gradually lost genes, becoming obligate parasites (the regression hypothesis). (b) Genome accretion: a simpler virus gradually acquired genes from hosts (the escape hypothesis applied in reverse). (c) Ancient origin: giant viruses represent an ancient lineage predating the last universal common ancestor. Phylogenomic analyses are inconclusive but suggest a complex evolutionary history involving extensive gene exchange between giant viruses and their hosts.",

      "options": ["The poliovirus genomic RNA is translated as a single polyprotein (~250 kDa) that undergoes co-translational and post-translational proteolytic processing by virus-encoded proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro/3CDpro; 2Apro performs the primary cleavage separating the structural (P1) from non-structural (P2-P3) precursors, while 3Cpro catalyzes most subsequent cleavages at specific Gln-Gly dipeptide sites, with the precise order and kinetics of processing regulating the temporal program of viral functions", "Host cell signal peptidases cleave the polyprotein as it passes through the endoplasmic reticulum", "The polyprotein is never cleaved and functions as a single multidomain enzyme", "Ribosomal frameshifting produces separate proteins from overlapping reading frames rather than polyprotein cleavage"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Picornavirus polyprotein processing: (1) Translation: The poliovirus genome (~7.5 kb) is a positive-sense RNA with a VPg (virus-encoded protein) covalently linked to the 5' end instead of a cap. Translation is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) in the 5' UTR, which directly recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit without scanning from the 5' end. A single open reading frame (~2200 codons) produces one large polyprotein (~250 kDa, 2209 amino acids). (2) Processing by 2Apro: The first cleavage occurs co-translationally between VP1 (C-terminus of P1) and 2A (N-terminus of P2). 2Apro is a cysteine protease that cleaves at its own N-terminus (autocatalytic cis-cleavage) between Tyr-Gly. This separates the structural precursor P1 from the non-structural region P2-P3 while the polyprotein is still being translated. 2Apro also cleaves host eIF4G (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G), shutting down cap-dependent host translation while IRES-dependent viral translation continues. (3) Processing by 3Cpro and 3CDpro: 3Cpro is the main viral protease, a cysteine protease with a serine protease-like fold. 3CDpro is the uncleaved precursor of 3C and 3D (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and has enhanced protease activity for certain cleavages. Together, 3Cpro/3CDpro catalyze 8-9 additional cleavages in the polyprotein, all at Gln-Gly (Q/G) dipeptide sites. (4) Processing cascade and functional regulation: The order and rate of processing are precisely regulated: P1 → VP0 + VP3 + VP1 (structural proteins for capsid assembly). P2 → 2Apro + 2B + 2C (2B disrupts membranes for replication complex formation, 2C is an ATPase/helicase). P3 → 3A + 3BVPg + 3Cpro + 3Dpol. Some intermediate precursors have distinct functions: 3AB localizes VPg to membranes for RNA replication initiation, 3CDpro has protease activity but also functions in RNA replication (binding the cloverleaf RNA structure). VP0 is further cleaved to VP4 + VP2 during virus maturation (this is an autocatalytic cleavage triggered during RNA encapsidation). (5) Temporal regulation: Early infection: 3CDpro predominates (before 3C/3D are fully separated), favoring RNA replication. Late infection: processed 3Cpro predominates, favoring structural protein processing and virion assembly. (6) Drug target: Protease inhibitors targeting 3Cpro (rupintrivir) have been developed as antivirals, paralleling the success of HIV protease inhibitors.",

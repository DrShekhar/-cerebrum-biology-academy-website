      "question": "The lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophage lambda represent two alternative developmental pathways. What molecular switch determines whether lambda enters the lytic or lysogenic pathway upon infection?",
      "options": [
        "The decision depends on the competition between the CI repressor (promoting lysogeny by repressing lytic genes) and the Cro protein (promoting lysis by repressing CI); at low multiplicity of infection with a healthy host, Cro dominates and lysis occurs; at high MOI or stressed host conditions, CI accumulates sufficiently to establish lysogeny by binding to OR1 and OR2 operators, activating its own transcription and repressing lytic genes",
        "Lambda always enters the lytic cycle first and lysogeny occurs only after failed lysis",
        "The decision is random and has no molecular basis",
        "The host cell membrane composition determines the viral pathway"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The lambda phage lytic-lysogenic decision is one of the best-understood genetic switches in biology, pioneered by Mark Ptashne and colleagues: (1) Key players: CI repressor (lambda repressor): a 236-amino acid protein that forms dimers and binds to the operator regions OR and OL. CI maintains lysogeny by repressing lytic gene transcription and activating its own transcription from PRM (promoter for repressor maintenance). Cro protein: a small (66 aa) repressor that also binds OR and OL, but with opposite binding preferences to CI. Cro promotes the lytic pathway by repressing CI transcription from PRM. (2) The OR operator has three binding sites (OR1, OR2, OR3) between divergent promoters PR (rightward, lytic genes) and PRM (leftward, CI gene). CI binding preference: OR1 > OR2 > OR3. Cro binding preference: OR3 > OR2 > OR1. (3) Lysogenic pathway: When CI is produced (from the establishment promoter PRE, activated by CII protein): CI dimers bind OR1 first \u2014 this represses PR (blocking lytic gene transcription). CI at OR1 cooperatively recruits CI to OR2 \u2014 this both further represses PR AND activates PRM (positive autoregulation of CI). At normal CI levels, OR3 is NOT occupied, so PRM is active. This creates a stable lysogenic state maintained by CI positive autoregulation. (4) Lytic pathway: When Cro accumulates (from PR): Cro binds OR3 first \u2014 this represses PRM (blocking CI transcription). Without CI, PR and PL remain active, expressing all lytic functions. (5) Decision parameters: High multiplicity of infection (MOI): more CII protein accumulates, activating PRE, producing more CI \u2192 lysogeny. UV damage/SOS response: RecA-stimulated CI autocleavage (same mechanism as LexA) \u2192 lytic induction. Host cell health: starved or UV-damaged host activates SOS \u2192 lysis.",

      "question": "HIV-1 uses a complex replication strategy involving reverse transcriptase. What three enzymatic activities does HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possess, and why is the enzyme error-prone?",
      "options": [
        "HIV-1 RT requires host cell DNA polymerase for all DNA synthesis steps",
        "HIV-1 RT has only one enzymatic activity \u2014 RNA polymerization",
        "HIV-1 RT is a highly accurate enzyme with error rates lower than cellular DNA polymerases",
        "HIV-1 RT has RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (synthesizing DNA from the RNA template), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (copying the first-strand cDNA into dsDNA), and RNase H activity (degrading the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids during reverse transcription); it lacks 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity, resulting in approximately one error per genome per replication cycle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits (p51 is derived from p66 by proteolytic processing) with three essential activities: (1) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP): The primary function \u2014 synthesizing a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand using the viral RNA genome as a template. This proceeds from a cellular tRNA primer (tRNALys3) that anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the viral RNA. (2) RNase H: Degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes. This is essential for: removing the RNA template after minus-strand DNA synthesis, generating the polypurine tract (PPT) primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis, and removing tRNA and PPT primers after they have served their function. (3) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP): Copies the minus-strand cDNA to generate the double-stranded proviral DNA. (4) Error rate: HIV-1 RT has an error rate of approximately 3.4 x 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle (about 1 mutation per 10 kb genome per cycle). This is ~10,000-fold higher than cellular DNA polymerases (which have proofreading exonuclease activity). The high error rate results from the absence of 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. (5) Consequences of error-prone replication: Rapid evolution: Within a single infected individual, HIV generates a cloud of variants (quasispecies) that enables immune escape, drug resistance, and tropism switching (CXCR4 vs. CCR5 coreceptor usage). Drug resistance: Mutations in RT (e.g., M184V for lamivudine resistance, K103N for nevirapine resistance) emerge rapidly under antiretroviral therapy, necessitating combination therapy (HAART). (6) RT as a drug target: Nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs: AZT, tenofovir, emtricitabine) are chain terminators lacking the 3'-OH for next nucleotide addition. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs: efavirenz, nevirapine) bind an allosteric pocket near the active site, distorting the enzyme.",

        "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-True"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: Positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA) viruses have genomes that are equivalent in polarity to mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly bound by host ribosomes and translated. For poliovirus: the ~7.4 kb genome contains a single ORF translated into a large polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by viral proteases (2Apro, 3Cpro/3CDpro) into structural proteins (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (including the RdRp 3Dpol). The 5' UTR contains an IRES that mediates cap-independent translation. S2 TRUE: Negative-sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) viruses carry genomes that are complementary to mRNA and cannot be directly translated. The virion must package its own RdRp to transcribe the negative-sense genome into positive-sense mRNAs upon entry. For influenza: the three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) are packaged with each of the eight genomic RNA segments as ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The polymerase uses a unique cap-snatching mechanism: PB2 binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, and PA cleaves 10-13 nt downstream, using this capped fragment as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis. S3 TRUE: Retroviruses (HIV, HTLV, MLV) use reverse transcriptase to convert their +ssRNA genome into dsDNA. The viral integrase enzyme then catalyzes integration of this dsDNA (provirus) into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the provirus is permanent and is transcribed by host RNA Pol II from the 5' LTR promoter. S4 FALSE: While most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses), the Poxviridae (vaccinia, variola/smallpox) replicate entirely in the CYTOPLASM. Poxviruses are large enough to encode their own DNA replication machinery, transcription enzymes, and mRNA processing factors, making them independent of the nuclear machinery.",

      "question": "Researchers infect bacterial cells with two different T4 phage mutants: Mutant A carries a mutation in gene 23 (major capsid protein) and Mutant B carries a mutation in gene 34 (tail fiber protein). Neither mutant can produce plaques alone. When cells are co-infected with both mutants simultaneously, plaques appear at a frequency of 2%. What genetic phenomenon explains this result?",
      "options": [
        "The host bacteria produced the missing proteins for both mutants",
        "Genetic recombination between the two phage genomes during co-infection generates wild-type recombinant phages with functional copies of both gene 23 and gene 34; the 2% plaque frequency reflects the recombination frequency between the two gene loci, indicating they are relatively far apart on the T4 genome",
        "The two mutant phages spontaneously reverted to wild-type simultaneously",
        "The two phage genomes fused into a single larger genome containing both functional genes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a classic phage cross experiment demonstrating intergenic recombination: (1) Experimental logic: Mutant A is gene 23-minus, gene 34-plus (23- 34+). Mutant B is gene 23-plus, gene 34-minus (23+ 34-). Neither can complete the lytic cycle alone because each lacks one essential function. (2) Co-infection: When both mutants infect the same bacterial cell simultaneously, both genomes replicate. During replication, the linear phage DNA molecules undergo homologous recombination (T4 has its own recombination machinery including UvsX, analogous to RecA). (3) Recombination outcomes: Parental types: 23- 34+ and 23+ 34- (non-functional, no plaques). Recombinant type 1: 23+ 34+ (wild-type recombinant, produces plaques). Recombinant type 2: 23- 34- (double mutant, non-functional). (4) Recombination frequency: The 2% plaque frequency represents the frequency of wild-type recombinants (23+ 34+). By convention, the map distance between gene 23 and gene 34 is estimated as 2 x 2% = 4 map units (multiplied by 2 because both recombinant classes \u2014 wild-type and double mutant \u2014 are produced in equal frequency, but only wild-type forms plaques). (5) Historical significance: Phage crosses were used by Seymour Benzer to map the rII region of T4 at extraordinary resolution, demonstrating that genes are composed of linear sequences of nucleotides (sites of mutation) and establishing the concept of the cistron (functional unit of the gene, equivalent to what we now call a gene). Benzer's work provided the first evidence for the fine structure of the gene before DNA sequencing was possible.",

      "question": "Influenza A virus undergoes antigenic shift and antigenic drift. What distinguishes these two mechanisms of antigenic variation, and why is antigenic shift more dangerous?",
      "options": [
        "Antigenic drift produces larger changes than antigenic shift",
        "Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza B, not influenza A",
        "Antigenic drift involves gradual accumulation of point mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes through error-prone RNA replication; antigenic shift involves reassortment of entire genome segments between different influenza strains co-infecting the same cell, potentially generating a novel HA or NA subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity, causing pandemics",
        "Both mechanisms produce identical types of antigenic changes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Influenza A virus antigenic variation operates through two distinct mechanisms with vastly different epidemiological consequences: (1) Antigenic drift (gradual change): The influenza RdRp (PB1-PB2-PA complex) lacks proofreading activity, producing approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle. Mutations in the antigenic sites of HA (hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein targeted by neutralizing antibodies) and NA (neuraminidase) gradually alter the epitopes recognized by the immune system. Antigenic drift is responsible for seasonal flu epidemics \u2014 previous immunity provides partial but incomplete protection against drifted variants, requiring annual vaccine updates. (2) Antigenic shift (major change): Influenza A has a segmented genome (8 segments). When two different influenza A subtypes co-infect the same cell (e.g., in a pig, which can be infected by both avian and human strains), their genome segments can be randomly reassorted during virion assembly. This can generate a virus with an entirely new HA and/or NA subtype to which the human population has NO pre-existing immunity. (3) Why shift is more dangerous: Drift changes: antibodies from previous infections/vaccinations still partially cross-react (reduced but not absent protection). Annual epidemics with moderate morbidity/mortality. Shift changes: entirely new HA or NA subtype, NO cross-reactive antibodies in the population, potential for pandemic (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, 2009 H1N1pdm). (4) HA subtypes: 18 known HA subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1-N11). Only H1, H2, H3 and N1, N2 have caused sustained human-to-human transmission. (5) Mixing vessel hypothesis: Pigs can be co-infected with avian and human influenza strains, serving as a mixing vessel for reassortment. However, reassortment can also occur in humans, birds, or other hosts.",

      "question": "A researcher isolates a novel virus from diseased plants. To determine whether the virus has an RNA or DNA genome, she purifies the viral nucleic acid and treats separate aliquots with DNase I, RNase A, and both enzymes. The nucleic acid is completely degraded by RNase A alone but resistant to DNase I. Additionally, when the nucleic acid is denatured and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, it migrates as a single band. What can she conclude about the genome?",
      "options": [
        "The virus has a double-stranded DNA genome",
        "The virus has no nucleic acid and is a prion",
        "The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome: sensitivity to RNase A confirms RNA (not DNA), resistance to DNase I confirms no DNA component, and migration as a single band after denaturation indicates a single-stranded (not double-stranded) molecule since dsRNA would separate into two complementary strands",
        "The virus has a double-stranded RNA genome"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This systematic nuclease sensitivity analysis reveals the genome type: (1) RNase A sensitivity: RNase A (ribonuclease A) specifically cleaves single-stranded RNA at pyrimidine (C and U) residues. Complete degradation by RNase A demonstrates the genome is RNA. DNase I resistance confirms it is not DNA. This immediately classifies the virus as an RNA virus (Baltimore Class III, IV, or V). (2) Single-stranded determination: When a double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA or dsDNA) is denatured (heated or treated with formamide/NaOH), the two complementary strands separate and migrate as two bands on a denaturing gel (or as a band with different mobility than the native molecule). When a single-stranded nucleic acid is denatured, it simply loses secondary structure but remains as a single molecule, migrating as a single band. The observation of a single band after denaturation indicates ssRNA. (3) Classification: The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome. To determine sense (positive or negative), additional tests are needed: if the purified RNA is infectious when transfected into plant cells, it is positive-sense (can be directly translated); if not infectious alone, it is negative-sense (requires viral RdRp). Most plant RNA viruses are positive-sense ssRNA (e.g., Tobacco Mosaic Virus, Potato Virus X, Cucumber Mosaic Virus). (4) Additional characterization: RT-PCR and sequencing would reveal the complete genome sequence. Electron microscopy of purions would reveal virion morphology (rod-shaped for TMV-like, icosahedral for others). Protease treatment before nuclease treatment confirms the nucleic acid is within a protein coat (capsid protects genome in intact virions).",

      "options": [
        "The viral Spike (S) protein trimer binds human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD); the S protein is then cleaved by host proteases TMPRSS2 (at the cell surface) or cathepsins (in endosomes) at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide that inserts into the host membrane and drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SARS-CoV-2 entry is a multi-step process involving receptor binding and protease-dependent membrane fusion: (1) Spike protein structure: The S protein is a large (~1,273 aa) trimeric class I fusion protein on the viral envelope. Each monomer has two subunits: S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (membrane fusion). S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues ~319-541). The RBD exists in two conformations: 'down' (receptor-inaccessible, immune-evasive) and 'up' (receptor-accessible). (2) ACE2 binding: The RBD in the 'up' conformation binds human ACE2 with nanomolar affinity. ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease normally involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7). It is expressed on type II alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and other tissues. (3) S protein priming: The S protein must be proteolytically activated: S1/S2 cleavage: The furin cleavage site (RRAR, a polybasic insertion not found in closely related bat coronaviruses) at the S1/S2 boundary is cleaved during biosynthesis in the producer cell's Golgi. This primes the protein. S2' cleavage: At the target cell, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) cleaves at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide. Alternatively, in cells lacking TMPRSS2, the virus enters via endocytosis and cathepsin L cleaves S2' in the acidic endosome. (4) Membrane fusion: The exposed S2 fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The S2 heptad repeat regions (HR1, HR2) fold into a six-helix bundle (6-HB), pulling the viral and cell membranes together and driving membrane fusion, releasing the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. (5) Therapeutic targets: Monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD block ACE2 binding. TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat, nafamostat) block protease priming. Fusion inhibitors targeting the 6-HB formation are in development.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment exploited the chemical differences between DNA and protein: (1) Rationale: In 1952, the debate between DNA and protein as the genetic material was ongoing despite Avery-MacLeod-McCarty's 1944 transformation experiments. Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage T2 because its biology was well understood: the phage injects its genetic material into E. coli while the protein coat remains outside. (2) Labeling strategy: Phosphorus (P) is present in DNA (phosphodiester backbone) but absent from amino acids/proteins. Sulfur (S) is present in proteins (cysteine and methionine amino acids) but absent from DNA. They grew T2 phage in E. coli cultures containing either 32P (radioactive phosphorus, labeling DNA) or 35S (radioactive sulfur, labeling protein) in separate preparations. (3) Infection experiment: 32P-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria \u2192 after infection, blender treatment (shearing force) separated empty phage coats ('ghosts') from infected bacteria \u2192 centrifugation pelleted bacteria (heavier) from phage coats (lighter supernatant). Result: 32P was found primarily in the bacterial pellet. 35S-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria \u2192 same procedure. Result: 35S was found primarily in the supernatant (phage coats). (4) Interpretation: DNA (32P) enters the bacterial cell and directs phage reproduction, while protein (35S) remains outside. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material of phage T2. (5) Historical context: Combined with Avery's transformation experiment, Chargaff's rules, and Watson-Crick's structure (1953), this experiment helped establish the central role of DNA as the universal genetic material.

      "options": [
        "PrPSc acts as a template that induces a conformational change in normal PrPC: the alpha-helix-rich PrPC refolds into the beta-sheet-rich PrPSc conformation through direct protein-protein interaction; PrPSc then recruits and converts additional PrPC molecules in an autocatalytic cascade, forming amyloid fibrils that are protease-resistant and accumulate as neurotoxic aggregates",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The prion hypothesis, proposed by Stanley Prusiner (Nobel Prize 1997), describes a unique mechanism of infectious disease: (1) Normal PrPC: The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein (253 amino acids in humans) expressed on the surface of neurons and other cell types. PrPC has a predominantly alpha-helical structure (42% alpha-helix, 3% beta-sheet). Its normal function is debated but may involve copper binding, cell signaling, and synaptic function. (2) PrPSc (scrapie form): The misfolded, disease-associated form has the SAME amino acid sequence as PrPC but a dramatically different conformation: 43% beta-sheet, 30% alpha-helix. PrPSc is insoluble, resistant to proteinase K digestion (yielding a protease-resistant core called PrP27-30), and resistant to denaturation by heat, UV, formaldehyde, and most sterilization procedures. (3) Conversion mechanism: The protein-only model proposes that PrPSc physically contacts PrPC and acts as a template for conformational conversion. The monomer conversion model: one PrPSc molecule converts one PrPC molecule in a 1:1 interaction. More likely, the nucleated polymerization model: small PrPSc oligomers (seeds/nuclei) recruit PrPC monomers to their growing ends, converting them to PrPSc. When fibrils break (fragmentation), more seeds are created, exponentially amplifying the process. (4) Amyloid formation: PrPSc molecules stack into cross-beta amyloid fibrils \u2014 extended beta-sheets with beta-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis. These fibrils aggregate into amyloid plaques visible histologically as spongiform change (vacuolation of brain tissue). (5) Prion strains: Different prion strains cause different disease phenotypes (incubation period, brain region affected) despite having the same amino acid sequence. This is explained by different PrPSc conformations \u2014 each strain represents a distinct stable misfolded structure that faithfully self-replicates. (6) Diseases: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, fatal familial insomnia (humans), scrapie (sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/'mad cow'), chronic wasting disease (deer/elk).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "T4 takeover of host gene expression is a multi-pronged strategy executed in temporal phases: (1) Immediate early (0-2 min): Proteins co-injected with the T4 DNA (Alt, internal protein I): Alt is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies Arg265 on one alpha subunit of host RNAP. This modification (occurring before any phage genes are transcribed) subtly alters RNAP promoter specificity to favor some T4 early promoters. MotA and AsiA proteins are expressed early: AsiA (Anti-Sigma 70 Inhibitor A) binds to region 4.2 of sigma-70, blocking its interaction with the -35 element of bacterial promoters. MotA (Modifier of Transcription A) binds to AsiA-modified sigma-70 and redirects RNAP to T4 middle-mode promoters that have a MotA-dependent element (MotA box) instead of a -35 sequence. (2) Host DNA degradation: T4 encodes several nucleases that degrade the host chromosome. T4 DNA is protected from its own nucleases by modification \u2014 T4 DNA contains hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) instead of cytosine, and HMC is further glucosylated by T4-encoded glucosyltransferases. This modified DNA is resistant to T4 restriction endonucleases that degrade unmodified (host) DNA. The degraded host DNA provides nucleotides for T4 DNA synthesis. (3) Alg (Anti-Late Gene silencing): At later times, the anti-sigma factor alters transcription patterns further. (4) Late gene transcription: T4 late genes are transcribed from late promoters that require the sigma factor-like protein gp33 and the co-activator gp55, along with the sliding clamp gp45 (T4 DNA polymerase processivity factor) loaded on T4 DNA. This couples late gene transcription to active T4 DNA replication \u2014 ensuring structural proteins are only made when DNA replication is well underway. (5) Net result: Within 5-10 minutes of infection, all host gene expression is shut down and the entire biosynthetic capacity of the cell is redirected to phage production.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Retroviral integration is a well-characterized enzymatic process: (1) Integrase structure: A 32 kDa enzyme (288 aa in HIV-1) with three domains: N-terminal domain (HHCC zinc-binding motif), catalytic core domain (DDE catalytic triad: D64, D116, E152, which coordinate two Mg2+ ions essential for catalysis), and C-terminal domain (non-specific DNA binding). Integrase functions as a multimer (tetramer is the active form). (2) 3' processing: In the cytoplasm (within the preintegration complex, PIC), integrase recognizes the conserved att sequences at both ends of the viral DNA (CA dinucleotide at each 3' end) and removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end, exposing recessed 3'-OH groups (reactive hydroxyl groups). (3) Nuclear import: The PIC (viral DNA + integrase + other viral and host proteins including LEDGF/p75) is transported into the nucleus. LEDGF/p75 (Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor) is a host chromatin-associated protein that tethers integrase to active transcription units (targeting integration to gene bodies of actively transcribed genes). (4) Strand transfer: Integrase catalyzes a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction: the two exposed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack the phosphodiester backbone of the target DNA on opposite strands, staggered by 5 bp (for HIV-1). This inserts the viral DNA into the host chromosome with 5 bp single-stranded gaps at each junction and 2-nt 5' overhangs of viral DNA that must be removed. (5) Gap repair: Host DNA repair enzymes (likely base excision repair and possibly NHEJ/HR pathways) remove the 2-nt overhangs, fill in the 5 bp gaps, and ligate the junctions. This generates the characteristic 5 bp target site duplications (TSDs) flanking the integrated provirus \u2014 a hallmark of retroviral integration.

      "explanation": "The one-step growth curve, developed by Emory Ellis and Max Delbruck (1939), reveals the intracellular phage replication timeline: (1) Experimental setup: Bacteria are infected at high MOI (to synchronize infection). Unadsorbed phage are removed. At time intervals, samples are taken and: (a) plated directly (measures extracellular free phage), or (b) treated with chloroform (lyses cells, measures total phage = intracellular + extracellular). (2) Eclipse period (0-12 min in this example): During this period, no complete phage particles exist anywhere \u2014 not extracellular (no lysis yet) and not intracellular (components haven't been assembled yet). The phage genome has entered the cell and is being replicated and transcribed, mRNA is being translated into phage proteins, but individual components (capsid proteins, tail fibers, baseplate, DNA) have not yet been assembled into complete infectious virions. Chloroform lysis at this time releases only disassembled components \u2014 no plaques form. This period was first described by Anderson and Doermann (1952). (3) Post-eclipse, pre-lysis (12-25 min): After the eclipse ends, intracellular assembly begins. Complete phage particles accumulate inside the cell. If cells are lysed artificially (chloroform), increasing numbers of phage are detected. However, no phage are detected externally because the cell has not yet lysed naturally. (4) Latent period (0-25 min): The total time from infection to the first release of phage by natural cell lysis. It includes the eclipse period plus the maturation period. (5) Rise period (25-~35 min): Cells lyse (triggered by phage-encoded holins and lysozyme/endolysin), releasing assembled phage. The titer increases from 1 to ~200 phage per cell.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ebola VP35 is a multifunctional virulence factor that is critical for immune evasion: (1) dsRNA binding: During Ebola replication, the viral RdRp (L protein) generates dsRNA intermediates (replication intermediates and potentially dsRNA ends of panhandle structures). These dsRNA molecules are normally sensed by cytoplasmic innate immune sensors: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I) recognizes short dsRNA with 5'-triphosphate ends, and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) recognizes long dsRNA. VP35 contains a dsRNA-binding domain (IID domain, residues 220-340) that binds and sequesters dsRNA, physically preventing recognition by RIG-I and MDA5. Crystal structures show VP35 caps the dsRNA ends, hiding the 5'-triphosphate from RIG-I. (2) Inhibition of RIG-I signaling: VP35 also directly interacts with PACT (Protein Activator of PKR), which normally activates RIG-I signaling. By binding PACT, VP35 prevents PACT-mediated RIG-I activation. (3) Inhibition of IRF3: VP35 inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3) by the kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. Without IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 cannot dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, or activate the IFN-beta promoter. This blocks the primary transcriptional induction of type I interferons. (4) Inhibition of IRF7: VP35 also inhibits IRF7 activation, blocking the amplification loop of interferon production. (5) Consequence: By simultaneously suppressing dsRNA sensing and IFN signaling at multiple points, VP35 creates an environment of unchecked viral replication. The absence of IFN-mediated antiviral defenses allows explosive viral replication in macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. This contributes to the severe pathology of Ebola virus disease (hemorrhagic fever, multi-organ failure, up to 90% fatality rate for some outbreaks). (6) VP24 cooperation: Another Ebola protein, VP24, inhibits IFN signaling downstream by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (binding karyopherin alpha1). Together, VP35 and VP24 create a comprehensive block of innate immunity.",

        "Quasispecies theory applies only to DNA viruses with high-fidelity replication"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Viral quasispecies theory, developed by Manfred Eigen and applied to virology by Esteban Domingo, describes the population genetics of rapidly mutating RNA viruses: (1) Error-prone replication: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and reverse transcriptases lack proofreading exonuclease activity. Error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle mean that for a 10 kb genome, essentially every newly synthesized genome contains at least one mutation. (2) Quasispecies structure: The viral population is not a single genotype but a dynamic distribution (cloud) of closely related variants. The distribution is centered on a master sequence (the most fit genotype in the current environment) but contains a vast number of minority variants at lower frequencies. (3) Selection unit: In quasispecies theory, natural selection acts on the entire mutant distribution, not just individual genotypes. The master sequence may not even be the most abundant genotype \u2014 the consensus sequence (derived from the most common nucleotide at each position) represents the population average. (4) Implications for antiviral therapy: (a) Pre-existing resistance: Due to the enormous population sizes (10^8-10^12 virions per patient for HIV, HCV) and high mutation rates, drug-resistant variants pre-exist at low frequency BEFORE drug treatment begins. For HIV, any single point mutation conferring drug resistance exists in the quasispecies at ~10^4-10^5 copies. (b) Rapid resistance emergence: Under monotherapy, resistant variants are rapidly selected, becoming the dominant population within days to weeks. (c) Combination therapy: Targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously (HAART for HIV: 2 NRTIs + integrase inhibitor; Harvoni for HCV: sofosbuvir + ledipasvir) requires multiple simultaneous resistance mutations to emerge, which is probabilistically extremely unlikely (~10^-10 x 10^-10 = 10^-20 for two independent mutations). (5) Error catastrophe: If the mutation rate exceeds a threshold (error threshold), the quasispecies cannot maintain genetic information and collapses. Mutagenic drugs (ribavirin, favipiravir, molnupiravir) exploit this principle by increasing the mutation rate above the error threshold \u2014 a strategy called lethal mutagenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The spot assay is the standard rapid method for determining phage host range: (1) Method: Each bacterial strain is grown to log phase in liquid culture. A thin layer of soft agar containing each strain is poured as a lawn on individual plates (or sectors of a single plate). Small volumes (5-10 uL) of serial dilutions of the phage lysate are spotted onto each lawn. Plates are incubated overnight. (2) Interpretation: Clear zone (zone of lysis): The phage can infect and lyse this bacterial strain. The zone may show individual plaques at low phage concentration or confluent lysis at high concentration. No clearing: The strain is resistant. Resistance can be due to: lack of the phage receptor on the bacterial surface, restriction-modification systems that degrade injected phage DNA, CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity targeting the phage, superinfection immunity (if the strain is a lysogen of a related phage), or abortive infection systems. Turbid clearing: The phage may be temperate (capable of lysogeny), producing turbid plaques due to immune lysogens growing within the plaque. (3) Efficiency of plating (EOP): For quantitative host range analysis, plaque counts on each susceptible strain are compared to the reference host. EOP = (plaques on test strain) / (plaques on reference host). EOP of 1.0 = equally efficient, <0.1 = restricted, >1.0 = the test strain is more permissive.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 latency is maintained by multiple reinforcing mechanisms at the transcriptional level: (1) Chromatin-based repression: The integrated provirus at the 5' LTR promoter has two positioned nucleosomes: nuc-0 (upstream) and nuc-1 (positioned directly over the transcription start site). In latency, nuc-1 is hypoacetylated and carries repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3) are recruited to the LTR by host transcription factors YY1, LSF, and CBF-1 (the Notch pathway effector that recruits the corepressor complex). (2) Transcription factor absence: In resting CD4+ T cells: NF-kB (p65/p50): sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkB\u03b1. The HIV LTR contains two NF-kB binding sites essential for efficient transcription. NFAT: also cytoplasmic, requires calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for nuclear entry. AP-1: not active in resting cells. Without these inducible transcription factors, basal LTR transcription is extremely low. (3) P-TEFb sequestration: In resting T cells, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T1) is sequestered in an inactive complex with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. Without active P-TEFb, even if RNA Pol II initiates at the LTR, it pauses at the TAR (transactivation response) element and cannot transition to productive elongation. The viral Tat protein normally recruits P-TEFb to TAR, but Tat levels are zero or minimal in latently infected cells (a chicken-and-egg problem). (4) DNA methylation: CpG dinucleotides in the LTR can become methylated, contributing to long-term silencing. (5) Latency reversal: T cell activation (antigen stimulation, PMA/ionomycin) activates NF-kB, NFAT, and P-TEFb, reactivating the provirus. 'Shock and kill' strategies use latency-reversing agents (LRAs) like HDAC inhibitors (SAHA, romidepsin), PKC agonists (bryostatin, prostratin), or BET inhibitors to reactivate latent proviruses, exposing them to immune clearance or antiretroviral drugs.",

      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: HSV-1 ICP47 (Infected Cell Protein 47) is a small (88 aa) immediate-early protein that binds the TAP transporter (TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer) in the ER membrane. TAP normally translocates proteasome-generated peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. ICP47 blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP from the cytoplasmic side, preventing peptide translocation. Without peptide loading, MHC class I molecules are retained in the ER (empty/peptide-receptive MHC I is unstable) and do not reach the cell surface. This renders HSV-infected cells invisible to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. S2 TRUE: Adenovirus E1A binds p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein), which are essential coactivators for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. By sequestering p300/CBP, E1A reduces histone acetylation at ISG promoters and blocks the ISGF3 (STAT1-STAT2-IRF9) complex from activating ISGs. E1A also blocks STAT1 signaling. S3 TRUE: Vaccinia virus (and other poxviruses) encode multiple secreted proteins that mimic host cytokine receptors. These viroceptors act as molecular sponges: viral TNF receptor homologs (CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, CrmE) bind and neutralize TNF-alpha, preventing its pro-inflammatory signaling. Viral IL-1 receptor homolog (B15R) binds IL-1beta. Viral IFN-alpha/beta receptor homolog (B18R/B19R) binds and neutralizes type I interferons. This is possible because poxviruses have large genomes (130-375 kb) capable of encoding many immune evasion proteins. S4 FALSE: Influenza NS1 (Non-Structural protein 1) is a potent innate immune antagonist with multiple functions: binds dsRNA (preventing RIG-I activation), inhibits the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 (required for RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination and signaling), blocks CPSF30 (inhibiting 3' processing of host mRNAs including IFN mRNA), and inhibits PKR activation.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TMV is the paradigm for understanding helical virus assembly: (1) Structure: TMV is a non-enveloped, rigid rod 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, with a 4 nm central channel. The capsid consists of approximately 2,130 copies of a single 17.5 kDa coat protein (CP) subunit arranged in a right-handed helix with 16.3 subunits per turn and a pitch of 2.3 nm. The ssRNA genome (6,395 nt) is embedded between protein subunits in a helical groove, with 3 nucleotides per CP subunit. (2) Assembly initiation: CP subunits self-associate into various aggregates depending on pH and ionic conditions. At neutral pH, the predominant form is the 20S aggregate \u2014 a two-layer disk of 34 subunits. The 20S disk recognizes and binds the Origin of Assembly Sequence (OAS, also called the packaging signal), a specific hairpin loop structure located approximately 900 nt from the 3' end of the RNA (within the gene encoding the movement protein). The RNA threads through the central hole of the disk and inserts between the two layers, which then convert (jaws mechanism) from a flat disk to a short helix (the lock-washer form). (3) Elongation: Additional CP subunits (as disks or smaller aggregates) add to the growing helix. Elongation in the 5' direction is rapid because the RNA loop is pulled through the central channel, progressively incorporating more RNA. Elongation in the 3' direction is slower and may involve addition of individual CP monomers. (4) Thermodynamic principles: CP-CP and CP-RNA interactions are both important. RNA is NOT required for helix formation (CP alone forms helical rods in vitro at low pH), but RNA dramatically accelerates and nucleates assembly under physiological conditions. The OAS ensures that TMV RNA is preferentially packaged over host RNAs. (5) Historical significance: Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat (1955) demonstrated that purified TMV RNA alone was infectious (confirming RNA as the genetic material of TMV), and reconstitution of infectious virions from purified RNA and CP subunits showed that self-assembly requires no host machinery.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system operates in three stages: (1) Adaptation (spacer acquisition): When a new phage infects the cell, the Cas1-Cas2 complex (Cas1 is an integrase, Cas2 is a structural scaffold) selects a ~30 bp segment (protospacer) from the phage DNA. Protospacer selection requires the presence of a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif, typically 5'-NGG-3' for S. pyogenes Cas9) flanking the protospacer. The selected protospacer is integrated at the leader end (5' end) of the CRISPR array, between the leader sequence and the first existing repeat. The repeat is duplicated in the process, creating: leader-new spacer-repeat-old spacer-repeat. This creates a chronological record of past infections. (2) Expression (crRNA biogenesis): The entire CRISPR array is transcribed as a single long pre-crRNA. A trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), encoded elsewhere in the CRISPR locus, has a region complementary to the repeat sequences and base-pairs with pre-crRNA. RNase III (host enzyme) processes the pre-crRNA:tracrRNA duplex into individual crRNA:tracrRNA units. Each mature crRNA:tracrRNA guide contains: the spacer sequence (20 nt complementary to the phage target) and the tracrRNA (which interacts with Cas9). (3) Interference (target cleavage): The Cas9 protein binds the crRNA:tracrRNA guide. Cas9 scans incoming DNA for PAM sequences (PAM recognition is the first step and occurs through protein-DNA contacts, not base-pairing). Upon finding a PAM, Cas9 locally unwinds the DNA and tests for complementarity with the crRNA spacer through Watson-Crick base-pairing (R-loop formation). If complementarity extends through the seed region (10-12 nt proximal to PAM), Cas9 undergoes a conformational change activating both nuclease domains: RuvC cleaves the non-target strand, HNH cleaves the target strand, creating a blunt-ended DSB 3 bp upstream of the PAM. (4) Self vs. non-self: The PAM sequence prevents self-targeting: the spacer in the CRISPR array lacks the PAM (the PAM is only present in the phage DNA flanking the protospacer). If the PAM is mutated or absent, Cas9 cannot bind and cleave. (5) Phage counter-defense: Phages evolve anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems by blocking DNA binding, preventing Cas protein loading, or degrading crRNAs.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Viroids are remarkable in their ability to replicate using solely host machinery: (1) Structure: Viroids are small (246-401 nt) circular ssRNA molecules with extensive intramolecular base-pairing forming a rod-like or branched secondary structure. They contain NO open reading frames and encode NO proteins. (2) Two families: Pospiviroidae (nuclear viroids, type species: Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid, PSTVd): replicate in the nucleus. Avsunviroidae (chloroplastic viroids, type species: Avocado Sunblotch Viroid, ASBVd): replicate in chloroplasts. (3) Nuclear viroid replication (asymmetric rolling circle): The plus-strand circular viroid RNA enters the nucleus. Host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II (normally transcribes DNA \u2192 mRNA) is redirected to use the viroid RNA as template (an aberrant template usage). Pol II initiates at a specific site and continuously copies the circular template (rolling circle mechanism), producing long concatemeric minus-strand RNA. The minus-strand concatemer serves as template for another round of Pol II transcription, producing concatemeric plus-strand RNA. The concatemers are cleaved into unit-length monomers by an unknown host RNase (likely RNase III-like activity recognizing specific structural elements). Monomeric linear RNAs are circularized by host tRNA ligase. (4) Chloroplastic viroid replication (symmetric rolling circle): Both plus and minus strands serve as templates (using a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, NEP). Both plus and minus concatemers are self-cleaved by embedded hammerhead ribozyme motifs \u2014 catalytic RNAs that self-cleave through a transesterification reaction requiring a specific tertiary structure and divalent metal ion. Monomers are ligated by host chloroplastic tRNA ligase. (5) Pathogenesis: Viroids cause disease through RNA silencing: viroid RNA is processed by host Dicer into viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) that enter the RISC complex and silence host genes with complementary sequences, causing developmental abnormalities. (6) Significance: Viroids may represent relics of the RNA World \u2014 self-replicating RNA molecules that predate the evolution of proteins.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Lambda lysogeny maintenance and induction: (1) The CI repressor is the key molecular switch. CI binds as dimers to the OL (operators left) and OR (operators right) regions. OR contains three binding sites: OR1, OR2, OR3. CI binds cooperatively: first to OR1 (highest affinity), then OR2, blocking RNA polymerase access to pR (rightward promoter for lytic genes like cro). CI bound at OR2 simultaneously activates its own transcription from pRM (promoter for repressor maintenance), creating a positive autoregulatory loop. At OL, CI similarly represses pL (leftward promoter for N gene and recombination functions). (2) CI dimers at OL and OR interact via DNA looping (long-range cooperativity), creating an octameric CI complex that further stabilizes repression. (3) At high CI concentrations, OR3 becomes occupied, which represses pRM \u2014 a negative autoregulatory mechanism preventing CI overaccumulation. (4) During SOS response (triggered by DNA damage from UV, mitomycin C, etc.): RecA protein binds to ssDNA gaps at stalled replication forks, forming RecA-ssDNA filaments (activated RecA*). RecA* stimulates the latent autocleavage activity of CI repressor. CI undergoes self-cleavage between Ala111 and Gly112 in the flexible linker connecting the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerization domain. (5) Cleaved CI can no longer dimerize or bind DNA cooperatively, and repression collapses rapidly (positive feedback: loss of CI at OR2 reduces pRM transcription). (6) With pR and pL derepressed: Cro protein is made from pR; Cro binds preferentially to OR3, preventing any residual CI expression. The N antitermination protein allows read-through of terminators. The Q antitermination protein activates late gene transcription (head, tail, lysis). (7) Excision: Int + Xis proteins catalyze prophage excision via site-specific recombination at attL and attR.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Calculating phage titer from plaque assay data: (1) The plaque assay is the standard method for quantifying infectious virus particles. Each plaque represents a zone of lysis initiated by a single infectious phage particle (assuming the Poisson distribution and that the multiplicity of infection is low enough that each plaque arises from one phage). (2) The formula for titer calculation: Titer (PFU/mL) = Number of plaques / (Dilution factor x Volume plated in mL). (3) Given data: 42 plaques counted, dilution = 10^-6, volume = 0.1 mL. (4) Calculation: Titer = 42 / (10^-6 x 0.1) = 42 / (10^-7) = 42 x 10^7 = 4.2 x 10^8 PFU/mL. (5) Key assumptions: Each plaque arose from exactly one phage (valid when dilution is sufficient); all viable phages formed visible plaques (some may be too small or turbid); the bacterial lawn was uniformly distributed; the volume was accurately measured. (6) Why PFU/mL and not particles/mL: The plaque assay only counts infectious particles. The actual number of phage particles (measured by electron microscopy or spectrophotometry) may be 10-1000 times higher due to the particle-to-PFU ratio \u2014 many particles may be defective, damaged, or unable to adsorb. (7) Statistical considerations: Reliable counts come from plates with 30-300 plaques (too few = high statistical error; too many = overlapping plaques undercount).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcription and integration: (1) Entry: HIV-1 gp120 binds CD4 receptor on T cells, triggering conformational change exposing the coreceptor binding site. Gp120 then binds CCR5 (macrophage-tropic) or CXCR4 (T-cell tropic) coreceptors. This triggers gp41 conformational change: the fusion peptide inserts into the host membrane, and the six-helix bundle forms, pulling viral and host membranes together for fusion. (2) Uncoating: The viral core (capsid cone) enters the cytoplasm. Capsid uncoating is now understood to be gradual and linked to reverse transcription and nuclear import (not immediate). (3) Reverse transcription (in the reverse transcription complex, RTC): Step 1 \u2014 tRNA-Lys3 (packaged from the host cell) anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the genomic RNA. RT synthesizes minus-strand strong-stop DNA (-sssDNA) by copying the 5' end: R region + U5. Step 2 \u2014 RNase H activity of RT degrades the RNA in the RNA:DNA hybrid at the 5' end. Step 3 \u2014 First strand transfer: -sssDNA jumps to the 3' end of the same or the other RNA copy (template switching), annealing via the R region complementarity. Step 4 \u2014 RT continues minus-strand DNA synthesis toward the 5' end of the RNA template. RNase H concurrently degrades the RNA template but leaves the polypurine tract (PPT, a purine-rich RNase H-resistant sequence). Step 5 \u2014 The PPT serves as primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. RT synthesizes plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA), copying: U3-R-U5-PBS (including tRNA primer). Step 6 \u2014 RNase H removes the tRNA primer and the PPT. Step 7 \u2014 Second strand transfer: +sssDNA anneals to the minus strand via PBS complementarity. Step 8 \u2014 Both strands are completed, resulting in linear dsDNA flanked by LTRs (U3-R-U5 at each end). The LTRs were generated by the two strand transfers. (4) Nuclear import: The pre-integration complex (PIC) containing the viral dsDNA, integrase, capsid, and host factors (including LEDGF/p75) is transported through nuclear pores. HIV can infect non-dividing cells because its PIC actively traverses intact nuclear pores (unlike gammaretroviruses like MLV, which require mitosis). (5) Integration: Integrase (IN) catalyzes: 3'-processing \u2014 removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end of the LTRs, exposing reactive CA-3'OH groups. Strand transfer \u2014 IN creates staggered cuts in host DNA (5 bp apart for HIV) and joins each viral 3' end to a host 5' phosphate. Host DNA repair enzymes fill in the gaps and ligate, creating the characteristic 5 bp target site duplication (TSD) flanking the provirus.

      "explanation": "Determining viral RNA genome sense (polarity): (1) The key principle: Positive-sense (+) RNA has the same polarity as mRNA and can be directly translated by ribosomes. Negative-sense (-) RNA is complementary to mRNA and must first be copied into mRNA by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) before translation. (2) The infectivity assay: If purified genomic RNA alone (naked RNA, no proteins) is introduced into susceptible cells and produces progeny virus, the genome must be positive-sense. This is because: The (+) RNA can immediately be translated by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including the RdRp needed for replication. No pre-existing viral proteins are needed to initiate infection. (3) For negative-sense viruses: Purified (-) RNA alone is NOT infectious because host cells lack RdRp \u2014 they have no enzyme that can copy RNA from an RNA template. The virion must carry its own RdRp (packaged during assembly). If purified (-) RNA is co-transfected with purified viral RdRp, infectivity is restored. (4) Protoplasts (plant cells enzymatically stripped of cell walls) are used because: Plant cells have rigid cell walls that block naked RNA entry. Protoplasts can take up RNA through PEG-mediated or electroporation methods. (5) Controls: Positive control: intact virus particles (should be infectious). Negative control: RNA treated with RNase before transfection (should be non-infectious). Mock transfection: buffer only. (6) Important caveats: Some (+) RNA viruses (like retroviruses) require reverse transcriptase packaged in the virion, so naked RNA would not be infectious despite being (+) sense. Ambisense viruses (some bunyaviruses) have both (+) and (-) regions on the same segment, complicating interpretation. dsRNA viruses: naked dsRNA is not infectious because the (+) strand cannot be released from the dsRNA duplex without viral proteins. (7) Alternative approaches: In vitro translation: (+) RNA will produce proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract; (-) RNA will not.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "HPV-mediated oncogenesis: (1) HPV is a small (~8 kb) dsDNA virus that infects basal keratinocytes of stratified squamous epithelia, entering through micro-wounds. (2) Early genes E6 and E7 are the primary oncoproteins. In low-risk HPV types (6, 11), E6 and E7 have weak transforming activity. In high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45), E6 and E7 have significantly stronger activity. (3) E7 protein mechanism: E7 binds pRb (retinoblastoma protein) through an LXCXE motif in the CR2 domain. This binding displaces E2F transcription factors from the pRb-E2F repressive complex. Free E2F activates transcription of S-phase genes (cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase). E7 also targets pRb for proteasomal degradation via cullin-2 ubiquitin ligase. Additionally, E7 binds and inactivates p21 and p27 CDK inhibitors, and disrupts HDAC complexes. (4) E6 protein mechanism: E6 binds the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP (E6-Associated Protein, also called UBE3A). The E6-E6AP complex acts as a neo-E3 ligase that recruits p53. E6AP ubiquitinates p53, targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. p53 is normally stabilized in response to DNA damage; its degradation eliminates the key checkpoint response. E6 also activates telomerase (hTERT) by inducing hTERT transcription, contributing to cellular immortalization. E6 additionally degrades PDZ domain proteins involved in cell polarity and growth control. (5) Viral integration: In high-risk HPV cancers, the viral DNA often integrates into host chromosomes. Integration frequently disrupts the E2 gene (E2 normally represses E6/E7 transcription). Loss of E2 leads to overexpression of E6 and E7. Integration is a critical step from low-grade to high-grade lesion progression. (6) Multi-step carcinogenesis: Initial HPV infection \u2192 persistent infection (immune evasion) \u2192 E6/E7 overexpression \u2192 p53/pRb inactivation \u2192 genomic instability (centrosome amplification, chromosomal aberrations) \u2192 accumulation of additional mutations \u2192 invasive carcinoma. This process typically takes 10-20 years. (7) This mechanism differs from acute transforming retroviruses (like RSV carrying v-src), which transform through viral oncogene expression.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Transduction mechanisms: (1) Generalized transduction: Occurs during the lytic cycle of certain phages (e.g., P1, P22 in Salmonella). During normal lytic development, the phage degrades host DNA to nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis. However, host DNA is not completely degraded before packaging begins. DNA packaging in phages like P1 uses a 'headful' mechanism: the terminase complex recognizes a pac (packaging) site on concatemeric phage DNA, makes a cut, and threads DNA into the empty prohead until it is full (~110 kb for P1). Occasionally (~1 in 10^5 to 10^7 phage), the terminase mistakenly recognizes a pseudo-pac sequence in the host chromosome. A headful of host DNA (~90-110 kb) is packaged into the phage head. This transducing particle contains ONLY host DNA \u2014 no phage DNA. It can inject this DNA into a new host cell, where it can recombine with the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination (RecA-dependent). Any host gene has an approximately equal probability of being transduced (hence 'generalized'), though some regions near pseudo-pac sites may be slightly overrepresented. (2) Specialized transduction: Occurs with temperate phages that integrate at specific sites (e.g., lambda at attB between gal and bio operons). During lysogenic induction, prophage excision normally occurs by precise reciprocal recombination between attL and attR (catalyzed by Int + Xis). Rarely (~1 in 10^6), aberrant excision occurs: recombination happens between sequences flanking attL and attR rather than within them. This generates a defective phage genome that has lost some phage genes but gained adjacent host genes. For lambda: excision to the left captures gal genes (\u03bbdgal = lambda defective gal-transducing). Excision to the right captures bio genes (\u03bbdbio). The transducing phage is defective (cannot complete lytic cycle alone) and requires a helper phage for replication and packaging. Only genes adjacent to the integration site can be transduced (hence 'specialized'). (3) Practical implications: Generalized transduction is used for genetic mapping (cotransduction frequency indicates gene proximity, analogous to linkage analysis). Specialized transduction was used to clone genes (phage lambda vectors) and for fine-structure mapping of gene regulation.",

For picornaviruses, the 5' end has a VPg protein (not a cap) and an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) that recruits ribosomes cap-independently. For coronaviruses, the 5' end is capped. The first proteins translated include the RdRp complex (replicase), which then replicates the genome. This is why purified (+) RNA is infectious \u2014 it is self-sufficient to initiate the replication cycle. S3 is FALSE: Most Group V (-) ssRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. Paramyxoviruses (measles, Sendai), Rhabdoviruses (rabies, VSV), and Filoviruses (Ebola) all replicate in the cytoplasm. They carry their own RdRp (L protein + P/VP35 cofactor) and do not require host splicing machinery. The exceptions are Orthomyxoviruses (influenza), which replicate in the nucleus because they use a unique 'cap-snatching' mechanism: the viral endonuclease steals 5' caps from host pre-mRNAs to prime viral mRNA synthesis, and their segmented genome requires nuclear splicing for some transcripts (M and NS segments). Bornaviruses also replicate in the nucleus. But the statement says 'exclusively in the nucleus' for all Group V, which is false. S4 is TRUE: Retroviruses (Group VI, e.g., HIV, MLV) carry (+) ssRNA genomes and package reverse transcriptase (RT). Upon entry, RT converts the RNA to dsDNA through the complex reverse transcription process involving two strand transfers. The viral dsDNA is flanked by LTRs and is integrated into host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme. Once integrated (as a 'provirus'), the viral DNA is transcribed by host RNA Polymerase II from the LTR promoter, producing both mRNAs for protein synthesis and full-length genomic RNA for packaging into new virions.",

        "Holin proteins accumulate in the inner membrane throughout infection, forming small oligomeric rafts; at a genetically programmed time determined by the holin allele, holins suddenly aggregate into large membrane lesions (micron-scale holes), collapsing the proton motive force and allowing pre-accumulated endolysins (muramidases) in the periplasm to access and degrade the peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in osmotic lysis",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The holin-endolysin lysis system: (1) Endolysins: These are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes synthesized in the cytoplasm. They accumulate in a fully active form in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. They cannot access their substrate (peptidoglycan in the periplasm/cell wall) because the intact inner membrane is impermeable to proteins. Endolysins lack signal peptides and are NOT secreted by the Sec or Tat pathways. Different phages encode endolysins with different specificities: lysozymes (cleave beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds between NAG and NAM), transglycosylases, amidases (cleave MurNAc-L-Ala bond), or endopeptidases (cleave peptide cross-links). (2) Holins: Small hydrophobic proteins (typically 100-150 amino acids) that accumulate in the inner membrane. They contain at least one transmembrane domain. During the latent period, holins exist as dimers and small oligomers in the membrane, maintained by the proton motive force (PMF). The holin allele determines the precise timing of lysis (the 'lysis clock'). At the genetically programmed time (typically 45-60 min for T4, adjustable by mutations): holins suddenly undergo a phase transition \u2014 they aggregate into large two-dimensional raft structures forming micron-scale holes in the inner membrane. This is an all-or-nothing event occurring within seconds. (3) Lysis cascade: Holin triggering collapses the PMF. The massive membrane lesions allow endolysin to flood into the periplasm. Endolysin rapidly degrades peptidoglycan. Loss of cell wall integrity + internal turgor pressure \u2192 osmotic lysis \u2192 release of ~100-200 progeny phage. (4) Antiholin: Many phages also encode an antiholin \u2014 a holin variant with an extra transmembrane segment that acts as a negative regulator. Antiholin forms heterodimers with holin, delaying the triggering event. The ratio of holin:antiholin tunes lysis timing. (5) Spanins: In Gram-negative bacteria, an additional component is needed: spanins (inner membrane and outer membrane spanning proteins) that disrupt the outer membrane. Without spanins, cells form spheroplasts but don't fully lyse. (6) Evolutionary optimization: The lysis timing represents a trade-off \u2014 earlier lysis releases fewer (but some) phage; later lysis allows more phage to be assembled but risks host death from other causes. This optimization follows a model similar to the marginal value theorem in ecology.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Phage display technology: (1) The system: Filamentous phages (M13, fd, f1) are non-lytic phages that infect F+ E. coli through the F pilus. They are long (~900 nm) flexible rods with a circular ssDNA genome (~6.4 kb) enclosed in ~2700 copies of the major coat protein pVIII and 5 copies each of pIII, pVI, pVII, and pIX at the tips. (2) Display principle: A gene encoding a peptide, protein domain, or antibody fragment (scFv or Fab) is fused to gene III (encoding pIII). pIII is the minor coat protein at one tip of the phage (5 copies). The fusion protein is expressed during phage assembly and incorporated into the phage particle. Each phage displays the foreign protein on its surface AND carries the DNA encoding it inside \u2014 this physical linkage of phenotype and genotype is the key feature. (3) Library construction: Massive combinatorial libraries (10^8 to 10^11 unique variants) can be created. For antibody libraries: the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains are randomly combined and displayed as scFv (single-chain variable fragments, VH-linker-VL). Random peptide libraries: oligonucleotide synthesis with randomized codons (NNK or NNS codon schemes). (4) Biopanning: Round 1: The phage library is incubated with the target molecule (antigen, receptor, etc.) immobilized on a surface (plate, beads, or column). Unbound phages are washed away. Bound phages are eluted (acid elution, competitive elution, or enzymatic cleavage). Round 2-4: Eluted phages infect E. coli, amplify, and produce a new phage pool enriched for target binders. This pool undergoes another round of selection with increased stringency. After 3-5 rounds, individual clones are tested for binding (ELISA) and sequenced. (5) Why it works for antibodies: The immune system naturally uses a similar process (somatic hypermutation + clonal selection). Phage display recapitulates this in vitro. Advantages over hybridoma technology: no animal immunization needed, can select against self-antigens (no tolerance), can select under non-physiological conditions, and human antibody fragments are obtained directly. (6) Applications: Drug discovery (adalimumab \u2014 first fully human antibody drug, developed via phage display, approved 2002), epitope mapping, enzyme engineering, receptor-ligand identification. George Smith and Gregory Winter shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing phage display and using it for directed antibody evolution.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Hemagglutinin receptor specificity and pandemic potential: (1) Sialic acid linkage specificity: Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds sialic acid (Neu5Ac) on host cell surface glycoproteins/glycolipids. The linkage between sialic acid and the underlying galactose determines host tropism. Alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids: predominant in avian intestinal epithelium (the primary infection site for avian influenza) and in human lower respiratory tract (deep lung alveoli). Alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids: predominant in human upper respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, nasal epithelium) \u2014 the primary site for efficient human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets. (2) Key residues 226 and 228: In H2 and H3 subtypes, amino acids at positions 226 and 228 of HA (using H3 numbering) are critical determinants of receptor specificity. Avian preference (alpha-2,3): Q226 + G228. Human preference (alpha-2,6): L226 + S228. These are the exact mutations observed in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic viruses that switched from avian to human receptor preference. In H1 subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic), different residues are involved (D190/D225). (3) Structural basis: Position 226 is in the 220-loop of the HA receptor binding pocket. Leucine at 226 (hydrophobic) creates a narrower binding pocket that accommodates the more linear alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. Glutamine at 226 (hydrophilic) creates a wider pocket that accommodates the kinked alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. Serine at 228 forms hydrogen bonds that stabilize the alpha-2,6 interaction. (4) Pandemic implications: The observation that only 2 amino acid changes can switch receptor preference suggests a low genetic barrier for avian influenza viruses to acquire human-transmissible properties. This is why H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza are closely monitored \u2014 they are highly pathogenic in humans but currently lack efficient human-to-human airborne transmission. Controversial 'gain-of-function' studies (Fouchier 2012, Kawaoka 2012) showed that as few as 4-5 mutations in H5N1 HA could enable airborne transmission in ferrets.

        "Methylation of phage DNA activates the restriction enzyme to cleave it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Type II Restriction-Modification systems: (1) Components: Two separate enzymes \u2014 a restriction endonuclease (REase) and a DNA methyltransferase (MTase) \u2014 that recognize the same short palindromic DNA sequence (typically 4-8 bp). The REase cuts both strands of dsDNA at or near the recognition site. The MTase adds a methyl group (from S-adenosylmethionine, SAM) to a specific base within the recognition site (typically N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, or N4-methylcytosine). (2) Self vs. non-self discrimination: Host DNA is methylated on both strands at all recognition sites (fully methylated = protected). After DNA replication, newly synthesized strands are hemimethylated (one strand methylated, one unmethylated). The MTase rapidly methylates the new strand before the REase can cleave hemimethylated sites (REases typically cut unmethylated DNA much more efficiently than hemimethylated DNA). Foreign DNA (phage, plasmid from a different strain) enters unmethylated at the recognition sites. The REase cleaves this unmethylated DNA rapidly (typically within minutes of entry). The kinetic race: MTase and REase compete for unmodified recognition sites, but REase cleaves unmethylated DNA ~100-1000x faster than MTase modifies it, ensuring foreign DNA is destroyed before it can be protected. (3) Phage counter-strategies: Anti-restriction: phage T3/T7 encode an Ocr (Overcome Classical Restriction) protein that mimics DNA and competitively inhibits Type I REases. Base modification: T4 phage replaces cytosine with hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in its DNA, which is not recognized by most REases. HmC is further glucosylated for additional protection. Stimulation of host MTase: some phages encode proteins that activate the host MTase to quickly methylate phage DNA after injection. Acquired methylation: if a phage occasionally escapes restriction (probability ~10^-4 per unmodified site), its DNA becomes methylated and all progeny from that cell are modified and resistant to that R-M system. DNA injection strategy: phages inject DNA slowly, presenting fewer sites at once, reducing the chance of complete restriction. (4) Ecological significance: R-M systems reduce phage infection efficiency by ~10^2 to 10^8 fold depending on the number of recognition sites in the phage genome. They are considered the first line of bacterial antiviral defense (CRISPR-Cas being the adaptive second line). They also serve as 'selfish genetic elements' \u2014 loss of the R-M system genes leads to cell death because unmethylated chromosomal DNA is cleaved by residual REase ('post-segregational killing').",

      "explanation": "Systematic pandemic risk assessment of a novel virus: (1) Step 1 \u2014 Genomic analysis: Full genome sequencing (using Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, or PacBio) to determine the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis places the virus within a known family/genus (e.g., Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae). Identification of the receptor binding protein (RBP) through homology to known viruses (e.g., spike protein for coronaviruses, hemagglutinin for influenza). Prediction of potential receptors using structural modeling (AlphaFold2) and sequence comparison of the receptor binding domain. Analysis of the furin cleavage site (if present), which can enhance pathogenicity (as seen with SARS-CoV-2). (2) Step 2 \u2014 Pseudotyped virus entry assays: Pseudotyped viruses (e.g., VSV or lentiviral particles bearing the novel virus's surface glycoprotein) allow safe study of viral entry without handling the novel pathogen at BSL-4. Test entry into human cell lines (HEK293T, A549, Calu-3, Caco-2) engineered to express candidate receptors (ACE2, DPP4, aminopeptidase N, etc.). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure binding affinity to purified human receptors. If no entry is observed into any human cell line, pandemic risk is lower (but not zero \u2014 receptor usage could change through mutation). (3) Step 3 \u2014 Replication in primary human tissues: Primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures at air-liquid interface (ALI) are the gold standard for respiratory virus assessment. These cultures recapitulate the pseudostratified epithelium with ciliated cells, goblet cells, and club cells. Key measurements: viral replication kinetics (growth curve), tropism (which cell types are infected, determined by immunofluorescence), cytopathic effect, innate immune response (interferon production, ISG expression), and apical vs. basolateral virus release (apical release facilitates respiratory transmission). Primary human intestinal organoids can assess enteric tropism. (4) Step 4 \u2014 Animal models: Ferrets are the standard model for respiratory virus transmission (similar respiratory tract anatomy to humans, sneeze reflex, can transmit influenza). Test direct infection (intranasal inoculation), contact transmission (co-housing), and airborne transmission (adjacent cages with airflow). Syrian hamsters are also useful (used extensively for SARS-CoV-2). Humanized mice (expressing human receptors, e.g., hACE2 transgenic mice) for pathogenesis studies. Monitor: disease signs, viral shedding, tissue tropism, immune response, and lethality. (5) Additional assessments: Serological surveys of human populations near the bat colony for evidence of prior spillover. Antigenic characterization to determine if pre-existing immunity exists. Assessment of susceptibility to existing antivirals.

        "ERVs are active retroviruses that regularly produce infectious particles in healthy humans",

        "ERVs only represent contamination artifacts from laboratory retroviruses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Endogenous retroviruses in the human genome: (1) Origin: Over millions of years, retroviruses have occasionally infected germline cells (oocytes, spermatogonia, or early embryonic cells). When a retrovirus integrates its proviral DNA into a germline cell's chromosomal DNA, that provirus can be vertically transmitted to all cells of the resulting organism and to subsequent generations through Mendelian inheritance. (2) Accumulation and inactivation: Once fixed in the germline, ERV sequences are subject to neutral evolutionary forces (genetic drift, mutation). Over time, ERV sequences accumulate point mutations, deletions, and insertions that inactivate their genes: gag (capsid proteins), pol (reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease), and env (envelope glycoprotein). Solo LTRs: Homologous recombination between the two LTRs flanking a provirus can delete the internal viral genes, leaving a single (solo) LTR. There are far more solo LTRs than intact ERVs. The oldest human ERVs (HERVs) date to ~100 million years ago (shared across primate lineages), while the youngest (HERV-K/HML-2) had active members as recently as ~1 million years ago and may still have low-level transcriptional activity. (3) Genomic impact: HERVs constitute ~8% of the human genome (~500,000 HERV-related sequences), compared to only ~1.5% that encodes proteins. ERV LTRs serve as regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers, insulators, and polyadenylation signals for host genes. LTR-driven transcription has been co-opted for tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the placenta, testis, and immune system. (4) Exaptation (co-option) examples: Syncytin-1 (HERV-W env) and Syncytin-2 (HERV-FRD env): These are captured retroviral envelope proteins that are essential for placental development. They mediate cell-cell fusion to form the syncytiotrophoblast \u2014 the multinucleated cell layer at the maternal-fetal interface. Different mammalian lineages have independently captured different ERV env genes for this function (convergent exaptation). ARC (Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated protein): A neuronal protein derived from a retroviral Gag polyprotein. ARC forms virus-like capsids that package mRNA and transfer it between neurons, functioning in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. HERV-derived regulatory elements: The innate immune gene network is partially regulated by HERV-derived enhancers that are activated by interferons, suggesting ERVs helped shape the evolution of antiviral immunity. (5) ERVs and disease: Most HERVs are inactive, but aberrant HERV expression has been associated with: autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 HERV-W and HERV-K), cancers (HERV-K expression in melanoma, breast cancer), and schizophrenia.

Initially mistaken for a Gram-positive bacterium due to its size (~750 nm diameter, comparable to Mycoplasma). Identified as a virus in 2003 by Didier Raoult and colleagues. (2) Genome: ~1.18 Mb linear dsDNA genome, encoding ~979 proteins. This is larger than the genomes of many obligate intracellular bacteria (Rickettsia prowazekii: ~1.1 Mb, Mycoplasma genitalium: ~0.58 Mb). Contains genes thought to be exclusive to cellular life: 4 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Arg, Cys, Met, Tyr), translation initiation and elongation factors, tRNA-modifying enzymes, topoisomerase (type IA and II), DNA repair enzymes (MutS mismatch repair, photolyase, nucleotide excision repair components), chaperones (multiple Hsp70/DnaK homologs), polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, and genes for 1-carbon folate metabolism. However, it lacks ribosomes and has incomplete translation machinery \u2014 it still requires the host cell's ribosomes for protein synthesis. (3) Particle structure: Icosahedral capsid (~500 nm) surrounded by fibrils (~125 nm long), giving total diameter of ~750 nm. A unique 'stargate' structure \u2014 a five-pointed star-shaped structure at one vertex that opens to release the genome during infection. Internal lipid membrane beneath the capsid. (4) Replication: Infects Acanthamoeba through phagocytosis. Establishes a 'viral factory' in the cytoplasm \u2014 a large compartment where viral DNA replication and transcription occur, analogous to the nucleus. The viral factory excludes host ribosomes (transcription inside, translation outside \u2014 paralleling the nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells). (5) Virophages: Sputnik virophage (discovered 2008) is a small virus (~50 nm, 18 kb genome) that co-infects Acanthamoeba cells along with Mimivirus. Sputnik cannot replicate without Mimivirus \u2014 it depends on Mimivirus's viral factory for its replication. Sputnik infection reduces Mimivirus replication efficiency and causes production of abnormal Mimivirus particles. This parasite-of-a-parasite relationship mirrors the virus-host dynamic of cellular life, suggesting Mimivirus occupies an ecological niche more like a cellular organism than a traditional virus. (6) Evolutionary implications: Giant viruses have reignited debate about whether viruses are 'alive.' Three hypotheses for their origin: (a) Genome reduction: giant viruses descended from a fourth domain of cellular life that gradually lost genes, becoming obligate parasites (the regression hypothesis). (b) Genome accretion: a simpler virus gradually acquired genes from hosts (the escape hypothesis applied in reverse). (c) Ancient origin: giant viruses represent an ancient lineage predating the last universal common ancestor. Phylogenomic analyses are inconclusive but suggest a complex evolutionary history involving extensive gene exchange between giant viruses and their hosts.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Picornavirus polyprotein processing: (1) Translation: The poliovirus genome (~7.5 kb) is a positive-sense RNA with a VPg (virus-encoded protein) covalently linked to the 5' end instead of a cap. Translation is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) in the 5' UTR, which directly recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit without scanning from the 5' end. A single open reading frame (~2200 codons) produces one large polyprotein (~250 kDa, 2209 amino acids). (2) Processing by 2Apro: The first cleavage occurs co-translationally between VP1 (C-terminus of P1) and 2A (N-terminus of P2). 2Apro is a cysteine protease that cleaves at its own N-terminus (autocatalytic cis-cleavage) between Tyr-Gly. This separates the structural precursor P1 from the non-structural region P2-P3 while the polyprotein is still being translated. 2Apro also cleaves host eIF4G (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G), shutting down cap-dependent host translation while IRES-dependent viral translation continues. (3) Processing by 3Cpro and 3CDpro: 3Cpro is the main viral protease, a cysteine protease with a serine protease-like fold. 3CDpro is the uncleaved precursor of 3C and 3D (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and has enhanced protease activity for certain cleavages. Together, 3Cpro/3CDpro catalyze 8-9 additional cleavages in the polyprotein, all at Gln-Gly (Q/G) dipeptide sites. (4) Processing cascade and functional regulation: The order and rate of processing are precisely regulated: P1 \u2192 VP0 + VP3 + VP1 (structural proteins for capsid assembly). P2 \u2192 2Apro + 2B + 2C (2B disrupts membranes for replication complex formation, 2C is an ATPase/helicase). P3 \u2192 3A + 3BVPg + 3Cpro + 3Dpol. Some intermediate precursors have distinct functions: 3AB localizes VPg to membranes for RNA replication initiation, 3CDpro has protease activity but also functions in RNA replication (binding the cloverleaf RNA structure). VP0 is further cleaved to VP4 + VP2 during virus maturation (this is an autocatalytic cleavage triggered during RNA encapsidation). (5) Temporal regulation: Early infection: 3CDpro predominates (before 3C/3D are fully separated), favoring RNA replication. Late infection: processed 3Cpro predominates, favoring structural protein processing and virion assembly. (6) Drug target: Protease inhibitors targeting 3Cpro (rupintrivir) have been developed as antivirals, paralleling the success of HIV protease inhibitors.",

      "question": "mRNA vaccines represent a revolutionary approach to immunization that was rapidly deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. What are the key molecular features that make synthetic mRNA vaccines effective, and how do they differ from traditional vaccine approaches?",
      "options": [
        "Synthetic mRNA vaccines contain a modified mRNA (with N1-methylpseudouridine replacing uridine to reduce innate immune activation), a 5' cap analog, optimized 5' and 3' UTRs, and a poly-A tail, all encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that facilitate cellular uptake via endocytosis; once released into the cytoplasm, host ribosomes translate the mRNA to produce the encoded antigen (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in prefusion conformation stabilized by proline substitutions), which is then processed and presented via MHC-I and MHC-II pathways to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses",

        "mRNA vaccines require adjuvants because the mRNA itself has no immunostimulatory properties",
        "The mRNA is translated in the nucleus and the protein is exported for immune recognition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "mRNA vaccine technology: (1) mRNA modifications: Natural unmodified mRNA triggers strong innate immune responses through pattern recognition receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5) that detect 'foreign' RNA. Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman discovered that replacing uridine with N1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) dramatically reduces innate immune activation while maintaining or improving translational efficiency. This modification is a natural modification found in human ribosomal RNA and tRNA. Additional modifications: 5-methylcytidine may also be incorporated. Codon optimization maximizes translation by using the most abundant tRNAs. (2) mRNA structure: 5' Cap: A synthetic cap analog (typically CleanCap, an enzymatic co-transcriptional capping system producing Cap1 structure: m7GpppA2'OMe) is essential for ribosome recruitment and mRNA stability. 5' UTR: Optimized for efficient ribosome scanning (Kozak sequence context). Coding sequence: Encodes the antigen with optimized codons. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer, mRNA-1273/Moderna): encodes the full-length spike protein with two proline substitutions (K986P, V987P) that lock the protein in its prefusion conformation \u2014 the immunologically preferred form that exposes the receptor binding domain. 3' UTR: Derived from stable mRNAs (e.g., beta-globin 3' UTR) to extend mRNA half-life. Poly-A tail: ~100-150 adenosines for mRNA stability and translational efficiency. (3) Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery: LNPs are ~80-100 nm particles composed of: ionizable lipid (e.g., SM-102 for Moderna, ALC-0315 for Pfizer) \u2014 positively charged at low pH for mRNA encapsulation, neutral at physiological pH; PEGylated lipid (prevents aggregation, extends circulation time); cholesterol (stabilizes the bilayer); DSPC (helper phospholipid). LNPs enter cells via macropinocytosis/endocytosis. The ionizable lipid becomes protonated in the acidic endosome, destabilizing the endosomal membrane and releasing the mRNA into the cytoplasm. (4) Immune response: The mRNA is translated by cytoplasmic ribosomes (it does NOT enter the nucleus and cannot integrate into DNA \u2014 there is no reverse transcriptase). Translated spike protein is: displayed on the cell surface \u2192 recognized by B cells \u2192 antibody production. Processed by proteasomes \u2192 peptides loaded onto MHC-I \u2192 presented to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Secreted protein is taken up by APCs \u2192 processed in endosomes \u2192 loaded onto MHC-II \u2192 presented to CD4+ helper T cells. The LNP itself acts as an adjuvant by activating the inflammasome. (5) Advantages over traditional vaccines: No live virus handling required (safety). Rapid development (sequence to candidate in days, not months). Manufacturing is sequence-independent (same process for any antigen). mRNA is transient (degraded within days, no genomic integration risk). Can encode prefusion-stabilized conformations impossible with inactivated virus. (6) Nobel Prize: Kariko and Weissman received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their nucleoside modification discoveries that enabled mRNA vaccines.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Influenza cap-snatching mechanism: (1) The viral polymerase complex: Influenza RdRp is a heterotrimeric complex: PB1 (polymerase basic 1): the catalytic RNA polymerase subunit (RNA synthesis). PB2 (polymerase basic 2): the cap-binding subunit \u2014 recognizes and binds m7G caps on host mRNAs. PA (polymerase acidic): the endonuclease subunit \u2014 cleaves host mRNAs to generate primers. The polymerase is associated with each of the 8 viral RNA (vRNA) segments through interactions with the conserved 5' and 3' terminal sequences of vRNA. (2) Cap-snatching mechanism: Step 1 \u2014 Host mRNA capture: PB2 binds to the 5' m7GpppXm cap structure of host Pol II transcripts. The polymerase preferentially targets nascent pre-mRNAs still being synthesized by host Pol II, particularly snoRNAs, snRNAs, and mRNAs near their transcription start sites. Step 2 \u2014 Cleavage: PA endonuclease (a PD-(D/E)xK superfamily nuclease requiring two Mn2+ ions) cleaves the host pre-mRNA 10-13 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure, generating a short capped RNA fragment. The cleavage site preference is for a purine, especially G, proximal to a CA dinucleotide. Step 3 \u2014 Primer extension: PB1 uses this capped fragment as a primer to initiate transcription of the vRNA template. The 3' end of the capped primer base-pairs with the 3' UC residues of the vRNA template. PB1 extends the primer, synthesizing viral mRNA in the 3' to 5' direction along the vRNA template. Step 4 \u2014 Polyadenylation: When PB1 reaches the poly-U stretch (5-7 residues) near the 5' end of the vRNA, it stutters/reiteratively copies the U's, generating a poly-A tail on the mRNA. The polymerase then terminates. (3) Why nuclear localization is required: Nascent host pre-mRNAs are only available in the nucleus during active transcription by RNA Pol II. After export to the cytoplasm, mRNAs are associated with translation machinery and their caps are less accessible. The viral polymerase specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II to access nascent transcripts. Treatment with alpha-amanitin (Pol II inhibitor) blocks cap-snatching by eliminating the source of capped primers, confirming the dependence on active host transcription. (4) Consequences: Cap-snatching depletes host mRNAs, contributing to host shutoff. The heterogeneous 5' extensions (10-13 host-derived nucleotides) are visible in influenza mRNA sequences. PA endonuclease is the target of baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), an approved anti-influenza drug. (5) Comparison: Other segmented negative-sense RNA viruses (bunyaviruses, arenaviruses) also use cap-snatching but in the cytoplasm, using cytoplasmic mRNAs as cap donors. Only orthomyxoviruses (influenza) require nuclear localization for this process. Rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses do NOT cap-snatch \u2014 they encode their own capping enzymes.",

      "explanation": "Analyzing each statement about viral tropism: S1 is TRUE: HIV-1 tropism is determined by the coreceptor used. R5-tropic (macrophage-tropic) variants use CCR5 as coreceptor and predominate during early/chronic infection. X4-tropic (T-cell line-tropic) variants use CXCR4 and emerge in ~50% of patients in late-stage disease, often associated with accelerated CD4+ T cell decline. Dual-tropic (R5X4) variants can use either coreceptor. The CCR5 Delta-32 deletion (32 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene, found in ~10% of European Caucasians as heterozygotes, ~1% homozygotes) confers resistance to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection in homozygotes. The 'Berlin patient' (Timothy Ray Brown) was cured of HIV by receiving a bone marrow transplant from a CCR5 Delta-32 homozygous donor. The tropism switch from R5 to X4 involves mutations in the V3 loop of gp120 that change its charge and structure. S2 is TRUE: Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) has an exceptionally broad host range among warm-blooded animals. Multiple cellular receptors have been identified: nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction (entry point for peripheral neurons), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56) expressed on neurons, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) expressed on neurons. These neuronal receptors are highly conserved across mammals, explaining the broad host range. The virus enters peripheral nerve endings at the bite wound and undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the CNS. S3 is FALSE: While CR2 (CD21) is the primary EBV receptor on B cells, EBV can also infect epithelial cells (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), T cells and NK cells (associated with EBV-associated T/NK cell lymphomas), and smooth muscle cells (associated with EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors in immunosuppressed patients). EBV entry into epithelial cells uses different mechanisms: the viral BMRF-2 protein binds integrins, and gH/gL binds to ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2). CR2 expression is also found on follicular dendritic cells and some T cell subsets. S4 is FALSE: AAVs are actually excellent gene therapy vectors precisely because different AAV serotypes have different tropisms. AAV1 targets skeletal muscle, AAV2 targets liver and CNS, AAV5 targets lung epithelium, AAV8 has strong liver tropism, AAV9 crosses the blood-brain barrier and targets CNS and heart. This serotype diversity allows tissue-specific gene delivery. AAV-based gene therapies include Luxturna (AAV2 for inherited retinal dystrophy), Zolgensma (AAV9 for spinal muscular atrophy), and Hemgenix (AAV5 for hemophilia B).

        "50% of bacteria will remain uninfected",
        "About 20% of bacteria will remain uninfected"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Poisson distribution in phage infection: (1) The Poisson distribution describes the probability of k independent events occurring in a fixed interval when the average rate (lambda) is known. For phage infection: lambda = MOI (average number of phages per bacterium). P(k) = (lambda^k * e^(-lambda)) / k! where k is the actual number of phages infecting a given bacterium. (2) Probability of 0 phages infecting a given bacterium: P(0) = (5^0 * e^(-5)) / 0! = 1 * e^(-5) / 1 = e^(-5) = 0.00674 = 0.674%. So approximately 0.67% of bacteria will be uninfected. Conversely, 1 - e^(-5) = 99.33% of bacteria will be infected by at least one phage. (3) Distribution of infections: P(1) = 5^1 * e^(-5) / 1! = 5 * 0.00674 = 3.37%. P(2) = 5^2 * e^(-5) / 2! = 12.5 * 0.00674 = 8.42%. P(3) = 5^3 * e^(-5) / 3! = 125/6 * 0.00674 = 14.04%. The most probable number is k = 4 or 5 (close to the mean). Many bacteria will receive 3-7 phages. (4) Why Poisson applies: Phage adsorption to bacteria is essentially random (each phage independently finds a bacterium). The number of phages is large. The probability of any specific phage infecting any specific bacterium is small. These conditions match the Poisson distribution requirements. (5) Practical implications: MOI = 1: 36.8% uninfected (e^(-1) = 0.368). MOI = 3: 5.0% uninfected. MOI = 5: 0.67% uninfected. MOI = 10: 0.0045% uninfected. To ensure virtually all bacteria are infected (e.g., for synchronous infection experiments), MOI >= 5-10 is typically used. (6) Limitations: Assumes all phages are equally infectious (no defective particles), all bacteria are equally susceptible, and adsorption is random. In reality, some phages may be defective, bacteria may vary in receptor density, and spatial heterogeneity exists in the culture. The actual number of uninfected cells may be higher than the Poisson prediction if the particle-to-PFU ratio is high.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phage therapy advantages and challenges: (1) Advantages \u2014 Specificity: Phages typically have narrow host ranges, infecting only specific species or even strains of bacteria. This is determined by receptor-binding proteins (tail fibers, tail spikes) that recognize specific surface structures (LPS O-antigens, OmpC, FhuA, etc.). Specificity preserves the commensal microbiome, avoiding dysbiosis-related complications (C. difficile infection, fungal overgrowth). (2) Self-amplification: Unlike antibiotics (which are administered at fixed doses and are degraded/excreted), phages replicate at the site of infection. Each phage-infected bacterium releases ~50-200 progeny phages. This creates an exponential increase in therapeutic agent precisely where bacteria are present \u2014 a 'self-dosing' property. As bacteria are eliminated, phage numbers decline (density-dependent regulation). (3) Biofilm degradation: Many phages encode depolymerases \u2014 enzymes that degrade bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) that form the biofilm matrix. These are often carried on tail spikes or baseplate structures. Depolymerases can penetrate biofilm, exposing bacteria to phage infection. Some engineered phages express enhanced depolymerase activity. Antibiotics often fail against biofilms because they cannot penetrate the EPS matrix, and biofilm bacteria are metabolically quiescent (slow-growing cells are resistant to most antibiotics). (4) Challenges \u2014 Narrow host range: The same specificity that preserves commensals means that the exact pathogenic strain must be identified before treatment. This requires rapid diagnostic methods and maintained phage libraries (phage banks). Phage cocktails (mixtures of multiple phages targeting different receptors) partially address this. (5) Resistance: Bacteria rapidly evolve phage resistance (mutation rate ~10^-5 to 10^-8 per generation) through: receptor modification/loss (but this often reduces virulence or fitness), restriction-modification systems, CRISPR-Cas acquisition, superinfection exclusion. Counter-strategy: phage cocktails with phages using different receptors; phages that target virulence-associated receptors (resistance = reduced virulence). (6) Immune clearance: The human immune system recognizes phage particles as foreign (protein/DNA complexes). Antibodies (especially IgG, IgM) can neutralize phages. The reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen) can clear phages from circulation. Repeated administration may trigger stronger immune responses. Long-circulating phage variants have been selected. (7) Regulatory challenges: Each phage preparation is unique (not a standardized chemical compound). Traditional drug approval frameworks (FDA, EMA) are designed for defined chemical entities. Compassionate use/emergency authorization has been used successfully (e.g., UC San Diego case of Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis, 2016). Belgium and Georgia have established regulatory frameworks for magistral phage preparations.",

      "explanation": "HBV replication \u2014 a pararetrovirus strategy: (1) Genome structure: HBV has one of the smallest viral genomes (~3.2 kb). The genome is a relaxed circular partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA): the minus strand is full-length with a terminal protein (P) covalently attached to its 5' end. The plus strand is incomplete (50-80% of full length) with an RNA oligomer at its 5' end. (2) Entry: HBV binds to the hepatocyte-specific receptor NTCP (sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) via the PreS1 domain of the Large surface antigen (L-HBsAg). After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the nucleocapsid is released and transported to the nucleus via nuclear pore complexes. (3) cccDNA formation: In the nucleus, rcDNA is repaired to form covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA): the viral P protein is removed from the minus strand 5' end. The minus strand gap (from the removal of the terminal protein) is sealed. The plus strand is completed by host DNA polymerases. RNA primers are removed and gaps are ligated. cccDNA exists as a minichromosome (associated with histones and non-histone proteins) and is the persistent reservoir of infection. cccDNA is extremely stable and is not directly targeted by current antiviral therapies. (4) Transcription: Host RNA Pol II transcribes cccDNA to produce several mRNAs: 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) \u2014 serves as BOTH the mRNA for core protein (HBcAg) and P protein AND the template for reverse transcription. 3.5 kb preCore mRNA \u2014 encodes HBeAg (secreted antigen). 2.4 kb mRNA \u2014 encodes Large surface protein. 2.1 kb mRNAs \u2014 encode Middle and Small surface proteins. 0.7 kb mRNA \u2014 encodes X protein (HBx, transcriptional transactivator). (5) Reverse transcription in the cytoplasm: P protein binds to the epsilon (\u03b5) stem-loop structure at the 5' end of pgRNA. P protein (which contains a terminal protein domain, spacer, reverse transcriptase domain, and RNase H domain) initiates minus-strand DNA synthesis using a tyrosine residue in the terminal protein domain as a primer (analogous to adenovirus terminal protein priming). After synthesizing 3-4 nucleotides, the P-DNA complex translocates to a complementary sequence (DR1) at the 3' end of pgRNA (first strand transfer). Minus-strand synthesis continues (5' \u2192 3' on the DNA, 3' \u2192 5' on the RNA template), with concurrent RNase H degradation of the pgRNA template. A short RNA oligomer at the 5' end of pgRNA (including DR1 sequence) is NOT degraded by RNase H and serves as the primer for plus-strand synthesis. This primer translocates to DR2 (near the 5' end of the minus strand) \u2014 second strand transfer. Plus-strand synthesis proceeds until it reaches the end of the minus strand template (which circularizes through terminal redundancy), generating rcDNA. Plus-strand synthesis is typically incomplete because nucleocapsids are either enveloped and secreted (stopping further synthesis) or recycled to the nucleus (to amplify cccDNA pool). (6) Clinical significance: cccDNA persistence is why HBV infection is difficult to cure (current antivirals suppress but don't eliminate cccDNA). HBV integration into host DNA (random, not part of the normal replication cycle) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma through insertional mutagenesis and HBx-mediated effects.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Luria-Delbruck Fluctuation Test (1943): (1) Historical context: Before Luria and Delbruck's experiment, it was debated whether bacterial variants arose from random spontaneous mutations (pre-existing before selection) or were induced by the selective agent (directed/Lamarckian mutation). (2) Experimental design: Start with multiple (20-50) independent small cultures, each inoculated from the same parent culture with a very small number (~100) of phage-sensitive bacteria. Grow all cultures to the same final density (~10^8 bacteria) WITHOUT any phage exposure. Plate aliquots from each independent culture onto plates containing T1 phage (selective condition). Count resistant colonies on each plate. Simultaneously, plate multiple aliquots from a single large bulk culture as a control. (3) Prediction 1 \u2014 Random pre-existing mutation (Darwinian): Mutations occur randomly during growth, independent of phage presence. If a mutation occurs early in a culture's growth, that culture will have MANY resistant descendants (jackpot culture). If mutations occur late or not at all, few or no resistant colonies appear. Different cultures will show HIGHLY VARIABLE numbers of resistant colonies. The distribution will NOT follow a Poisson distribution but will show excess variance (variance >> mean). (4) Prediction 2 \u2014 Induced mutation (Lamarckian): Each bacterium has the same probability of becoming resistant when exposed to phage. The number of resistant colonies from each culture should follow a Poisson distribution with variance approximately equal to the mean. (5) Results: Luria and Delbruck observed extreme fluctuation in the number of resistant colonies between independent cultures (some cultures had 0 resistant colonies, others had hundreds \u2014 'jackpot' cultures). The variance was much greater than the mean (variance/mean ratio >> 1). The bulk culture control showed low variance (Poisson-like). (6) Conclusion: Resistance mutations arise randomly and spontaneously before phage exposure (Darwinian selection, not Lamarckian induction). Phage acts as a selective agent, not a mutagenic agent. (7) Mathematical framework: Luria and Delbruck developed the 'Luria-Delbruck distribution' \u2014 a probability distribution that models random mutation with clonal expansion. The mutation rate (mu, mutations per cell per generation) can be estimated from the distribution of resistant colony counts. Modern methods (Ma-Sandri-Sarkar maximum likelihood estimator) provide more accurate mutation rate estimates. (8) Legacy: This experiment was one of the first rigorous demonstrations that evolution in bacteria follows Darwinian principles. It earned Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria (along with Alfred Hershey) the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (9) Modern note: While the Luria-Delbruck experiment conclusively showed that most resistance arises from random pre-existing mutations, some stress-induced mutagenesis systems (like the SOS response, RpoS-dependent mutagenesis) can increase mutation rates under stress, somewhat blurring the Darwinian/Lamarckian boundary \u2014 though these increase mutation RATE, not directionality.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Coronavirus proofreading and genome size: (1) The RNA virus mutation rate problem: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) lack proofreading activity and have error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle. According to Eigen's error threshold theory, there is a maximum genome size that can be maintained for a given mutation rate before error catastrophe (accumulation of lethal mutations faster than selection can purge them). For typical RNA virus mutation rates, the maximum genome size is ~15-20 kb. Most RNA viruses conform to this: picornaviruses ~7.5 kb, influenza ~13.5 kb total, paramyxoviruses ~15 kb. (2) Coronavirus exception: Coronaviruses have genomes of 26-32 kb \u2014 by far the largest among RNA viruses. This would be impossible without a mechanism to reduce mutation rates. (3) nsp14 ExoN proofreading: The coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex is encoded as two large polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1ab, the latter produced by -1 ribosomal frameshifting). nsp14 (non-structural protein 14) contains TWO enzymatic activities: N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain \u2014 belongs to the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases. C-terminal N7-methyltransferase domain \u2014 involved in mRNA capping. The ExoN domain proofreads newly synthesized RNA by removing 3' terminal mismatched nucleotides (analogous to the epsilon subunit of bacterial DNA Pol III or the 3'-to-5' exonuclease of eukaryotic DNA polymerases). nsp10 acts as an essential cofactor, forming an nsp10-nsp14 complex that activates ExoN activity. (4) Experimental evidence: Knockout of ExoN activity (by mutating the DEDD catalytic residues, e.g., D90A/E92A in SARS-CoV nsp14) results in: 15-20 fold increase in mutation rate, reduced viral fitness, increased sensitivity to mutagenic nucleoside analogs (like ribavirin, remdesivir), and in some coronaviruses, lethal loss of viability. ExoN-deficient SARS-CoV-2 mutants are attenuated and have been explored as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. (5) Implications for genome size: With ExoN proofreading, coronavirus mutation rates are ~10^-6 to 10^-7 per nucleotide per replication \u2014 closer to some DNA viruses. This ~15-20 fold reduction shifts the error threshold to allow genome sizes of ~30+ kb. The large genome encodes: 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) for replication, capping, proofreading, immune evasion. 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N). Variable numbers of accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, etc.). (6) Drug development implication: ExoN proofreading activity can excise chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (like remdesivir) that have been incorporated into the growing RNA chain. Remdesivir partially overcomes this through delayed chain termination (it is incorporated, allows a few more nucleotides to be added, then causes stalling \u2014 making ExoN-mediated removal more difficult).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "RSV and retroviral oncogenesis: (1) Rous sarcoma virus (RSV): Discovered by Peyton Rous in 1911 \u2014 he showed that a cell-free filtrate from chicken sarcomas could transmit the tumor. Rous received the Nobel Prize in 1966 (55 years later). RSV is unique among retroviruses: it carries a viral oncogene (v-src) AND is replication-competent (retains gag, pol, env genes). Most other acute transforming retroviruses (v-abl, v-erbB, v-myc, v-ras, v-raf, etc.) are replication-defective because the oncogene replaces essential viral genes. (2) v-src mechanism: v-src encodes a constitutively active non-receptor tyrosine kinase (pp60v-src). The cellular proto-oncogene c-src (pp60c-src) is tightly regulated: its kinase activity is normally repressed by intramolecular binding of a C-terminal phosphotyrosine (Y527) to the SH2 domain, creating a closed/autoinhibited conformation. v-src lacks Y527 (truncated C-terminus) and carries activating point mutations \u2192 constitutively active kinase. Constitutive Src activity phosphorylates numerous substrates: Ras-MAPK pathway activation, PI3K-Akt pathway activation, STAT3 activation, cytoskeletal remodeling (via phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins), and suppression of cell-cell adhesion. This drives uncontrolled proliferation, morphological transformation, and anchorage-independent growth. (3) Proto-oncogene concept: Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus (1976 Nobel Prize) used a src-specific DNA probe to show that normal chicken cells contain a gene (c-src) closely related to v-src. This established the proto-oncogene concept: viral oncogenes are captured and mutated versions of normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) involved in growth regulation. Over 30 retroviral oncogenes have been identified, each derived from a different cellular proto-oncogene. (4) Slow-transforming retroviruses (insertional mutagenesis): Avian leukosis virus (ALV) lacks a viral oncogene. Its genome contains only gag-pol-env flanked by LTRs. ALV causes tumors with long latency (~6-12 months) and at low frequency. Mechanism: Proviral insertion near a cellular proto-oncogene (most commonly c-myc) results in: Promoter insertion: the viral LTR promoter drives overexpression of the proto-oncogene. Enhancer insertion: the viral LTR enhancer activates the proto-oncogene's own promoter (can act at distances of several kb, in either orientation). Insertional inactivation: rarely, proviral insertion disrupts a tumor suppressor gene. This is a two-step process: infection \u2192 random integration \u2192 rare integration near a proto-oncogene \u2192 clonal expansion \u2192 tumor. (5) Comparison: Acute transforming retroviruses: carry a viral oncogene, transform rapidly (days-weeks), transform at high frequency, often replication-defective. Slow-transforming retroviruses: no viral oncogene, transform slowly (months), transform at low frequency, replication-competent. Both demonstrate that dysregulation of normal cellular growth control genes can cause cancer.",

      "options": [
        "The T4 terminase complex (gp16 small terminase + gp17 large terminase) is an ATP-powered molecular motor that translocates dsDNA into the prohead through the portal vertex; gp17 functions as both the ATPase motor and the endonuclease that cuts concatemeric DNA, generating ~170 pN of force through an ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational change cycle that compresses the DNA to near-crystalline density (~500 mg/mL) inside the capsid",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "T4 DNA packaging motor: (1) Overview: The T4 genome (~169 kb) is one of the largest phage genomes. DNA packaging is a critical step in virion assembly where the linear dsDNA genome must be actively translocated into a preformed icosahedral prohead (precursor capsid). The prohead contains an internal scaffolding core that is degraded by a prohead protease (gp21) before packaging. (2) Terminase complex: Small terminase (gp16): Recognizes the DNA (concatemeric DNA produced by recombination-dependent replication). Forms a ring-shaped oligomer (~8-11 subunits) that wraps DNA. Loads the large terminase onto the DNA. Large terminase (gp17, ~70 kDa): A pentameric ring-shaped ATPase motor. Contains two domains: N-terminal ATPase domain (ASCE superfamily ATPase) and C-terminal nuclease domain (cuts concatemeric DNA). The motor generates one of the strongest known molecular forces: ~170 piconewtons (pN), comparable to the stall force of kinesin but packaging DNA against enormous internal pressure. (3) Packaging mechanism: Initiation: Terminase recognizes and binds to the concatemeric DNA (T4 uses a headful packaging mechanism \u2014 it packages ~102% genome equivalents, creating terminal redundancy and circular permutation). The terminase-DNA complex docks onto the portal vertex (gp20 dodecameric ring) of the prohead. Translocation: gp17 pentamer acts as a two-phase motor: ATP binding causes the motor subunits to grip the DNA tightly. ATP hydrolysis drives a conformational change that pushes ~2 bp of DNA into the prohead per ATPase event. Each gp17 subunit alternately grips and releases the DNA (likely a sequential/rotary mechanism around the pentameric ring). The translocation rate is ~700 bp/sec (initially), slowing as the head fills due to increasing internal back-pressure. The motor packages ~10 bp per ATPase cycle (2 bp per subunit x 5 subunits). Termination: When the head is full (~169 kb, headful signal), gp17 nuclease domain cuts the DNA. The terminase-portal interaction is disrupted. Neck/tail proteins (gp13, gp14, gp15) attach to seal the portal and prevent DNA escape. (4) Internal conditions: The DNA inside the capsid reaches a concentration of ~500 mg/mL \u2014 near-crystalline density. Internal pressure reaches ~60 atm (comparable to 20 times the pressure in a car tire). DNA is arranged in concentric coils (spool-like arrangement). Counterions (Mg2+, polyamines like putrescine and spermidine) partially neutralize the DNA phosphate backbone charges. (5) DNA ejection: During infection, when the tail fibers bind to the bacterial surface, the stored energy from the compressed DNA drives initial ejection through the tail tube into the host cell. Internal pressure can push ~50% of the genome; the remainder may require active mechanisms (host factors or transcription-dependent processes).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Plant antiviral RNAi: (1) Recognition of viral dsRNA: During viral replication, dsRNA is produced as: Replication intermediates of (+) RNA viruses (complementary +/- strand duplexes). Structured regions (hairpins, stem-loops) in viral RNA genomes. Products of viral RdRp transcription. These dsRNAs are aberrant molecules not normally found in plant cells and trigger the RNAi pathway. (2) Dicer processing: Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes in plants (unlike animals that have one Dicer, plants have multiple DCLs): DCL4 produces 21 nt siRNAs (primary antiviral defense). DCL2 produces 22 nt siRNAs (backup pathway if DCL4 is suppressed). DCL3 produces 24 nt siRNAs (involved in transcriptional gene silencing via DNA methylation). DCLs cleave dsRNA processively, generating siRNA duplexes with 2 nt 3' overhangs (a hallmark of RNase III family enzymes). (3) RISC assembly and targeting: siRNA duplexes are methylated at the 3' end by HEN1 methyltransferase (protects against uridylation and degradation). One strand (guide/antisense) is loaded into AGO1 (the primary antiviral Argonaute in Arabidopsis). AGO1 uses the guide strand to scan cellular RNAs for complementary sequences via Watson-Crick base-pairing. When a complementary viral RNA is found, AGO1's PIWI domain (which has RNase H-like slicer activity) cleaves the target RNA between positions 10 and 11 relative to the guide strand 5' end. The cleaved RNA is degraded by cellular exonucleases. (4) Signal amplification \u2014 secondary siRNAs: RDR6 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 6) uses cleaved viral RNA fragments as templates to synthesize new dsRNA (converting single-stranded viral RNA targets into dsRNA). This dsRNA is processed by DCL4 into secondary siRNAs, which enter RISC. This amplification loop generates a massive antiviral siRNA pool that far exceeds the initial trigger \u2014 a unique feature of plant (and C. elegans) RNAi not found in mammalian RNAi. SGS3 (Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3) stabilizes the RDR6-generated dsRNA. (5) Systemic silencing: The silencing signal can spread from the initial infection site to distant parts of the plant through plasmodesmata (cell-to-cell) and phloem (long-distance). Mobile siRNAs (21-24 nt, possibly as protein complexes) move systemically, establishing antiviral defense in tissues ahead of the infection front. This is analogous to vertebrate interferon-mediated systemic innate immunity. (6) Viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs): Nearly all plant viruses encode at least one VSR \u2014 proteins that counteract RNAi. Examples: P19 (tombusvirus) \u2014 binds siRNA duplexes, preventing RISC loading. HC-Pro (potyvirus) \u2014 inhibits HEN1 methylation and RISC assembly. P38 (turnip crinkle virus) \u2014 binds AGO1 through a GW/WG motif, mimicking GW182. 2b (cucumber mosaic virus) \u2014 binds AGO1 and dsRNA. VSRs are major virulence determinants \u2014 loss of VSR results in asymptomatic infection.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Satellite viruses vs defective interfering particles: (1) Satellite viruses: Defined as subviral agents whose nucleic acid has no significant sequence similarity to the helper virus. They encode at least their own capsid protein. They depend on the helper virus for replication machinery (RdRp, etc.). Example: Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV): a small (~1 kb) RNA satellite that depends on Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) as helper. The STMV RNA is replicated by TMV's RdRp but packaged in its own small T=1 icosahedral capsid. Satellite panicum mosaic virus (SPMV) depends on Panicum mosaic virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV): The most medically important satellite \u2014 depends on Hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its envelope (HBsAg). HDV has a circular ssRNA genome (~1.7 kb) that replicates using host RNA Pol II (like viroids) and encodes only one protein (delta antigen). HDV can replicate its RNA independently but requires HBV HBsAg for packaging, secretion, and infection of new hepatocytes. (2) Satellite RNAs (satRNAs): Even simpler than satellite viruses \u2014 they do NOT encode their own capsid protein. They are small RNAs (300-1500 nt) that are replicated and encapsidated by the helper virus. Example: satellite RNA of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). SatRNAs can dramatically alter disease symptoms \u2014 either attenuating or exacerbating disease depending on the specific satRNA-helper virus-host combination. (3) Defective interfering (DI) particles: Generated during high-multiplicity passage of virtually any virus. They are deletion mutants of the standard virus genome. They RETAIN essential replication signals (origins of replication, packaging signals, promoters) at the genome termini. Internal sequences (often encoding structural or accessory proteins) are deleted. They have SIGNIFICANT sequence homology to the helper virus (because they are derived from it). They cannot replicate independently (missing essential genes) but their genomes are replicated by the standard virus's replication machinery. They COMPETE with standard virus for replication and packaging resources. At high MOI, DI particles accumulate and suppress standard virus replication (von Magnus effect, first observed with influenza in 1951). (4) Ecological/evolutionary significance: DI particles act as molecular parasites of the helper virus. They create oscillating dynamics: standard virus produces DI particles \u2192 DI particles suppress standard virus \u2192 DI particles decline without helper \u2192 standard virus recovers. This cycling can attenuate disease severity and may benefit the host. DI particles have been explored as antiviral therapeutics (therapeutic interfering particles, TIPs). Satellite viruses may represent ancient relationships between different genetic elements \u2014 possibly remnants of a primordial RNA world where genetic cooperation and parasitism were common. (5) Key distinction: Satellites have NO sequence relationship to the helper (different evolutionary origin). DI particles ARE derived from the helper (same evolutionary origin but with deletions).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Superinfection exclusion mechanisms: (1) Concept: Superinfection exclusion (SIE, also called superinfection immunity or superinfection resistance) prevents a cell already infected by one virus from being productively infected by a closely related virus. This is distinct from lysogenic immunity (CI repressor-mediated) and restriction-modification systems. SIE acts at the level of viral entry or very early post-entry steps. (2) Receptor modification/destruction: T4 phage (lytic): Immediately after infection, T4 expresses genes that modify the bacterial surface. The rIII gene product and other early proteins alter or destroy the receptor(s) used by T4 for adsorption. T4 also glycosylates its own DNA (hydroxymethylcytosine + glucose modifications) to distinguish self from non-self and to resist restriction enzymes. Many phages encode receptor-modifying enzymes (acetylases, glycosyltransferases) that alter LPS, OmpC, or other surface structures. (3) Membrane-level exclusion \u2014 Injection blocking: Phage T4: The Imm (immunity) and sp (spackle/gp61) gene products insert into the inner membrane shortly after infection. Imm protein blocks DNA injection by superinfecting T4 through the inner membrane (but doesn't prevent phage adsorption to the outer membrane). Sp protein blocks the lysis induced by superinfecting T-even phages by blocking a lysis pathway. Lambdoid phages: The SieA and SieB exclusion systems (encoded by lambda prophage): SieA blocks DNA injection of superinfecting phages at the inner membrane. SieB triggers abortive infection (premature lysis) of cells that manage to be superinfected, sacrificing the cell to prevent phage production. (4) DNA degradation: Some prophage-encoded systems function analogously to restriction-modification: they degrade incoming phage DNA while protecting the resident prophage/host DNA. This overlaps with but is distinct from classical R-M systems. (5) Lambda lysogenic immunity (distinct from SIE): CI repressor produced by the resident prophage binds to operators of incoming lambda DNA, preventing lytic development. This is sequence-specific \u2014 a lambda lysogen is immune to superinfection by lambda but not by phage P22 (different operators). This is technically superinfection immunity, not exclusion \u2014 the incoming DNA enters but cannot develop, rather than being blocked from entering. (6) Ecological significance: SIE provides a competitive advantage to the first phage to infect a cell. It prevents wasteful competition for cellular resources (ribosomes, nucleotides, energy). For temperate phages, it protects the lysogenic investment \u2014 if a second phage could superinfect and lyse the cell, the resident prophage would also be destroyed. SIE is analogous to superinfection exclusion in eukaryotic viruses (e.g., HIV envelope-mediated CD4 downregulation prevents secondary HIV infection; influenza NA cleaves sialic acid receptors).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Zoonotic viral emergence barriers: (1) Exposure barrier: Ecological factors determine human-animal contact frequency. Deforestation, agricultural intensification, bushmeat hunting, live animal markets, and urbanization increase spillover opportunities. Reservoir hosts often show no disease (bats harbor coronaviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses; rodents harbor hantaviruses, arenaviruses; birds harbor influenza). Intermediate/amplifier hosts may be needed (civets for SARS-CoV-1, camels for MERS-CoV, pigs for Nipah). (2) Infection barrier \u2014 Receptor compatibility: The viral attachment protein must bind a human receptor with sufficient affinity. SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD binds human ACE2 with high affinity. Avian influenza H5N1 HA binds alpha-2,3-sialic acid poorly binds alpha-2,6-sialic acid (human upper respiratory tract). Innate immune evasion: The virus must counteract human interferon responses. Species-specific restriction factors (TRIM5alpha, tetherin/BST-2, APOBEC3G, MxA) may block replication of animal viruses in human cells. (3) Adaptation barrier: Polymerase adaptation: Avian influenza PB2 has E627 which functions well at avian body temperature (40-41C) but poorly at human upper airway temperature (33C). The E627K mutation adapts the polymerase to mammalian temperature. Codon usage optimization improves translation efficiency. (4) Transmission barrier: Most critical and least frequently crossed. The virus must replicate to high titers, be present in transmissible body fluids/aerosols, survive in the environment, and infect new hosts before the current host dies. The R0 must exceed 1 for sustained transmission. (5) Examples: SARS-CoV-2 had high ACE2 binding affinity and a furin cleavage site enabling pandemic spread. HIV-1 had multiple cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees but only Group M achieved pandemic spread. Ebola repeatedly spills over from bats but has limited human-to-human transmission (R0 = 1.5-2.5, requires direct contact with body fluids).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Replication-incompetent viral vectors: (1) Design principle: Essential viral genes are deleted from the viral genome. The foreign antigen gene is inserted in place of or alongside remaining viral genes. A complementing cell line stably expresses the deleted essential gene(s). In complementing cells: vector genome is replicated, viral proteins including the complemented essential protein are expressed, and infectious vector particles are assembled. In normal cells: the vector can infect and express the foreign antigen but CANNOT produce infectious progeny because the essential gene product is absent. (2) Examples: Adenovirus vectors (Ad5, Ad26, ChAdOx1): E1 gene region deleted. Produced in HEK293 cells expressing Ad5 E1. Used in COVID-19 vaccines (J&J Ad26.COV2.S, AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S). Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA): Lost ~30 kb of genome through >570 passages. Can infect mammalian cells but cannot complete replication cycle. Lentiviral vectors (from HIV-1): Third-generation vectors split essential genes across 4 plasmids. Self-inactivating design with deleted U3 promoter. (3) Safety advantages: No risk of reversion to virulence (unlike live attenuated vaccines in option B). Safe for immunocompromised individuals. Better immunogenicity than inactivated vaccines (option D) because intracellular antigen production stimulates both MHC-I and MHC-II pathways. (4) Limitations: Lower immunogenicity per dose compared to replication-competent vectors. Requires specialized complementing cell lines. Pre-existing immunity to vector can reduce effectiveness.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Abortive infection systems: (1) Concept: Abi systems sacrifice the infected cell to protect the bacterial population. This is programmed cell death analogous to apoptosis in multicellular organisms. (2) The Rex system (lambda prophage-encoded): RexA is activated by phage DNA-protein complexes. RexA activates RexB, an inner membrane ion channel. RexB collapses the membrane potential causing ATP depletion, cessation of macromolecular synthesis, and cell death before the phage completes its replication cycle. (3) Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems: Normal state: labile antitoxin neutralizes the toxin. During phage infection: if the phage disrupts host gene expression, the labile antitoxin is degraded faster than replenished. Free toxin kills the cell. Examples: MazE/MazF (mRNA interferase), ToxI/ToxN (endoribonuclease). Phages counter TA systems by encoding antitoxin mimics (T4 Dmd protein). (4) Retron-based defense: Retrons produce multicopy single-stranded DNA via reverse transcriptase. The retron functions as a sensor \u2014 phage-encoded anti-defense proteins inadvertently trigger the retron sensor, activating an effector toxin that kills the cell. (5) CBASS system: Phage infection activates a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase producing cyclic oligonucleotides that activate effector proteins (phospholipases, endonucleases, pore-forming proteins) killing the cell. Analogous to the mammalian cGAS-STING pathway. (6) Kin selection: Abi is maintained because the cost to the individual is outweighed by the benefit to clonal relatives, especially when phage burst size is large.",

        "A dN/dS ratio of 1.6 indicates neutral evolution with no selective pressure",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1: (1) Context: gag and pol are in overlapping reading frames, with pol in the -1 frame relative to gag. A stop codon at the end of gag normally terminates translation. (2) The slippery sequence: U UUU UUA allows simultaneous tRNA slippage at the A and P sites. After slipping one nucleotide 5'-ward, tRNAs can re-pair in the -1 frame due to the repetitive sequence. Translation continues through pol. (3) Stimulatory RNA structure: A stem-loop downstream causes ribosome pausing, increasing frameshifting probability. (4) Stoichiometry: ~5-10% frameshifting produces ~10-20:1 Gag:Gag-Pol ratio. This is critical: too much Gag-Pol causes premature protease activation and defective assembly; too little means insufficient RT and IN. Even 2-fold changes in frameshifting are lethal. (5) Processing: Gag-Pol is incorporated into virions alongside Gag. The protease domain self-activates as a homodimer and cleaves both polyproteins into MA, CA, NC, p6, PR, RT, and IN. Protease inhibitors target this step. (6) Other viruses using -1 frameshifting: Coronaviruses (ORF1a/1b junction, ~25-30% efficiency using a pseudoknot), HTLV-1, astroviruses, and many plant viruses.

Nucleation: 20S disk binds to the origin-of-assembly sequence ~900 nt from the 3' end. Upon RNA binding, the disk transitions from flat ring to helical lock-washer conformation. Elongation: Additional disks add, RNA threads through central channel. Proceeds bidirectionally but faster toward 5' end. Each subunit binds 3 nucleotides. Final: ~300 nm rod, 2130 CP subunits, 16.33 subunits per turn. Key: RNA is essential for nucleation; no empty capsid forms. (2) Poliovirus icosahedral assembly: P1 precursor is cleaved by 3CDpro into VP0, VP3, VP1. 5S protomer: VP0+VP3+VP1. 14S pentamer: five protomers. 75S empty capsid: twelve pentamers assemble without RNA. RNA packaging: (+) ssRNA is inserted into procapsid. Maturation: VP0 autocatalytically cleaved to VP4+VP2 (catalyzed by conserved His and RNA backbone). This stabilizes the capsid enormously.

In neuronal nuclei, linear viral DNA (152 kb) circularizes. Lytic gene expression is silenced. (2) Chromatin silencing: Viral DNA acquires repressive histone marks: H3K9me3 (deposited by SUV39H1/2, recognized by HP1) and H3K27me3 (deposited by PRC2/EZH2). These create heterochromatin on lytic gene promoters. (3) LAT: The only abundant latency transcript. A long non-coding RNA producing a stable 2 kb intron. Functions: anti-apoptotic (inhibits caspases 8 and 9, critical for neuronal survival), encodes viral miRNAs (miR-H2, miR-H6) that target ICP0 and ICP4 mRNAs, and promotes H3K27me3 deposition on lytic genes (analogous to XIST).

Phase I transcription occurs genome-wide at low levels. If sufficient IE expression occurs, ICP0 (RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase) degrades PML nuclear bodies, IFI16, and disperses repressive chromatin.

Packaged enzymes include: multi-subunit RNA polymerase (viral, not host), mRNA capping enzyme (D1/D12), poly-A polymerase, early transcription factor VETF, and topoisomerase.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "dsRNA virus immune evasion strategy: (1) dsRNA as a PAMP: Eukaryotic cells do not normally produce long dsRNA. Cytoplasmic dsRNA is recognized as a danger signal by multiple innate immune sensors: RIG-I and MDA5 (signal through MAVS to induce interferons), PKR (phosphorylates eIF2alpha shutting down all translation), OAS/RNase L (2-5A pathway degrades all cellular and viral RNA). Activation of these pathways would be lethal to the virus. (2) Conservative transcription: Rotavirus VP1 (RdRp) and VP3 (capping enzyme) are located inside the double-layered core particle. VP1 transcribes the (-) strand of each dsRNA segment, producing (+) mRNAs. The (+) mRNAs are extruded through channels at the 5-fold vertices of the VP2 inner capsid layer. VP3 caps the 5' end of each mRNA as it exits. The dsRNA genome NEVER leaves the core. This is called conservative transcription. (3) Replication: (+) mRNAs serve dual functions: translated by host ribosomes and serve as templates for (-) strand synthesis. New (-) strands are synthesized inside assembling core particles from the (+) template, generating new dsRNA segments. This occurs within viroplasms \u2014 cytoplasmic inclusions that concentrate viral components and exclude innate immune sensors. (4) All dsRNA virus families use this strategy: Reoviridae (rotavirus, reovirus, orbivirus), Birnaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Totiviridae (fungi). This explains why dsRNA virus particles always contain the RdRp \u2014 they MUST transcribe within the particle.

      "options": [
        "This represents adaptive evolution on a rugged fitness landscape: the initial rapid increase reflects accumulation of beneficial mutations of large effect; the plateau indicates the population has reached a local fitness peak where all single-step mutations are neutral or deleterious; the renewed increase after clonal isolation reflects escape from clonal interference, allowing the population to explore new mutational pathways to higher fitness peaks",
        "Each plateau represents the virus acquiring antibiotic resistance",
        "The pattern represents random genetic drift with no selective component",
        "The plateaus indicate the virus has reached maximum possible fitness and cannot evolve further"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Experimental viral evolution dynamics: (1) Initial rapid adaptation: When a virus is introduced to a new environment (new host cell type, different temperature, presence of a drug), many mutations offer substantial fitness improvements. Beneficial mutations of large effect are quickly selected. This phase follows diminishing returns epistasis \u2014 early beneficial mutations have large effects, later ones have progressively smaller effects. (2) Fitness plateau at local peaks: As the most beneficial mutations are fixed, the population approaches a local fitness peak. All or most single-step mutations from this peak are neutral or deleterious. The mutation supply rate (population size x mutation rate) determines how quickly the population can explore multi-step mutational pathways to escape. In large RNA virus populations, multiple beneficial mutations arise simultaneously and compete (clonal interference), slowing adaptation. (3) Clonal isolation effect: Isolating a single high-fitness clone removes the genetic diversity (and clonal interference). From this new starting point, the clone may access different mutational pathways than the diverse population could. This can allow exploration of novel regions of sequence space and escape from the local peak. (4) Diminishing returns: Each successive plateau is harder to surpass because: the remaining beneficial mutations have smaller fitness effects, the population is closer to the global fitness optimum, and compensatory/epistatic constraints increase. (5) Fisher's geometric model: Mutations of large effect are beneficial when far from the optimum but deleterious when close. As fitness increases, the probability that a random mutation is beneficial decreases. (6) Practical implications: This understanding informs vaccine development \u2014 live attenuated vaccines can potentially evolve toward higher fitness (reversion to virulence) during passages in the host.

      "options": [
        "NA inhibitors are transition-state analogs that bind the NA active site, blocking its sialidase activity; this prevents the cleavage of sialic acid residues on the host cell surface and newly assembled virions, causing progeny virions to remain tethered to the cell surface and to aggregate with each other through HA-sialic acid interactions, thereby blocking viral spread to new cells while not preventing initial infection or intracellular replication",

        "NA inhibitors prevent viral uncoating by blocking M2 ion channel activity",
        "NA inhibitors block viral entry by preventing HA-sialic acid binding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Neuraminidase inhibitor mechanism: (1) NA function: Neuraminidase (NA) is a tetrameric glycoprotein enzyme (sialidase) on the influenza virion surface. It cleaves alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 sialic acid linkages. (2) NA roles in the viral life cycle: Virus release: NA cleaves sialic acid residues on the infected cell surface. Without this, newly budded virions remain attached to the cell via HA-sialic acid interactions (HA on the virion binds sialic acid on the cell). NA also removes sialic acid from viral glycoproteins (HA and NA themselves are glycosylated), preventing virion self-aggregation. Mucus penetration: NA cleaves sialic acid residues on mucins in the respiratory tract, allowing the virus to penetrate through the mucus layer to reach epithelial cells. (3) NA inhibitor design: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu, oral prodrug), zanamivir (Relenza, inhaled), peramivir (Rapivab, IV): These are transition-state analogs designed to mimic the oxocarbenium ion transition state of the NA-catalyzed sialic acid cleavage reaction. They bind with high affinity to the conserved catalytic site of NA, competitively inhibiting enzymatic activity. (4) Consequences of NA inhibition: Progeny virions bud normally from the infected cell but remain tethered to the cell surface via HA-sialic acid bonds. Virions aggregate into clumps (HA on one virion binds sialic acid on another). Viral spread from cell to cell and from the respiratory tract is blocked. However: initial infection of the cell is NOT prevented, intracellular viral replication proceeds normally, and the infected cell still produces virions. Therefore, NA inhibitors are most effective when given early (within 48 hours of symptom onset). (5) Resistance: The most common oseltamivir resistance mutation is H275Y (N2 numbering) or H274Y (N1 numbering) in NA, which reduces drug binding without eliminating enzymatic activity. Pre-2009 seasonal H1N1 had widespread H275Y resistance. Post-2009 pandemic H1N1 remains largely sensitive. Zanamivir resistance is rarer because zanamivir more closely resembles the natural substrate.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Adenovirus protein-primed DNA replication: (1) Genome structure: Linear dsDNA genome (~36 kb) with inverted terminal repeats (ITRs, ~100-140 bp) at each end. Each 5' end is covalently linked to a terminal protein (TP, 55 kDa). (2) Initiation: The precursor terminal protein (pTP, 80 kDa) and the viral DNA polymerase (Ad pol) form a heterodimeric complex. This pTP-pol complex binds to the ITR at the genome end. Host nuclear factor I (NFI) and Oct-1 transcription factors enhance initiation by binding to sequences within the ITR adjacent to the origin. pTP provides a free hydroxyl group on Ser-580 (in human Ad5) as the primer terminus. Ad pol catalyzes the covalent addition of dCMP to pTP-Ser, forming a pTP-dCMP initiation complex. This occurs at position 4 of the ITR template (a GTA sequence). (3) Elongation: After addition of a few nucleotides (pTP-CAT), the complex jumps back to position 1-3 of the template (template slippage), aligning CAT with the conserved terminal GTA sequence. Elongation then proceeds continuously by strand displacement. The non-template strand is displaced as ssDNA. No lagging strand synthesis occurs \u2014 each strand is replicated independently. The displaced ssDNA is coated by viral DNA-binding protein (DBP), which also stimulates processivity. (4) Replication of the displaced strand: The displaced ssDNA can circularize through base-pairing of the ITR regions (forming a panhandle structure). The dsDNA ITR in the panhandle resembles a genome terminus and can serve as a new replication origin. A second pTP-pol complex initiates at this new origin, converting the panhandle to full-length dsDNA. (5) TP processing: After replication, pTP is cleaved to mature TP by the adenovirus-encoded protease (AVP) during virion maturation. TP remains covalently linked to the 5' ends of the genome in mature virions. (6) Advantages of protein priming: No need for Okazaki fragments, RNA primers, or a primase. No end-replication problem (because TP is always present at the 5' end). Efficient replication of linear genomes without telomerase.

Found in picornaviruses (3B/VPg), caliciviruses, potyviruses, and some other RNA virus families. (2) Confirming VPg presence: Proteinase K treatment: Degrade the protein component while preserving RNA. Proteinase K-treated RNA will migrate faster on agarose/polyacrylamide gels than untreated RNA because the attached protein retards electrophoretic mobility. The mobility shift should be ~2-4 kDa worth of mass. Immunoprecipitation: Raise antibodies against the candidate VPg protein. Anti-VPg antibodies should co-precipitate the viral RNA (pulldown assay). This confirms covalent linkage. Radiolabeling: Label RNA with 32P and proteins with 35S-Met. After gel electrophoresis, the VPg-RNA complex will show both labels at the same position. Proteinase K removes the 35S signal but not the 32P. (3) Determining VPg function: Cap substitute: Some VPgs serve as a 5' cap analog for translation initiation. Test by comparing in vitro translation of VPg-RNA vs. de-VPg-RNA (proteinase K treated). If VPg is required for translation, removing it will reduce or abolish translation. Calicivirus VPg directly recruits eIF4E for translation initiation. Replication primer: In picornaviruses, VPg-pUpU serves as the primer for RNA replication. The viral RdRp uridylylates VPg using a cis-acting RNA element (the cre element in poliovirus) as template. Test by: showing that anti-VPg antibodies inhibit in vitro replication, demonstrating uridylylation of purified VPg by the viral RdRp in vitro, and showing that mutations in the VPg tyrosine (Tyr-3 in poliovirus) abolish priming and are lethal.

EBNA1 maintains the episome by tethering it to host chromosomes during mitosis (it binds oriP on the viral episome and host chromosomal attachment sites). Found in: Burkitt lymphoma (endemic form). The c-myc translocation (t(8;14), t(2;8), or t(8;22)) provides the proliferative drive; EBNA1 just maintains the episome.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Influenza segment packaging: (1) Challenge: Influenza A has 8 distinct vRNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS). Each must be present for the virion to be infectious. If packaging were random, the probability of getting all 8 by chance = (1/8)^7 = 1/2,097,152 \u2014 far too low for viable infection. (2) Selective packaging: cis-acting packaging signals are located at the 3' and 5' termini of each vRNA segment, extending into the adjacent coding regions (typically 20-120 nt of coding sequence at each end). These signals are segment-specific \u2014 swapping them between segments redirects packaging. (3) RNA-RNA interactions: In vitro studies show that the 8 vRNA segments form specific inter-segment RNA-RNA base-pairing interactions. These form a supramolecular complex in which each segment contacts at least one other segment. Mutations disrupting these interactions reduce packaging efficiency. Electron tomography of budding virions reveals the 8 RNP segments arranged in a '7+1' configuration (7 segments surrounding 1 central segment). (4) Sequential/hierarchical assembly: Evidence suggests segments are incorporated in a specific order. Some segments (e.g., NA, NS) are more frequently lost than others, suggesting they are added later in the assembly process. The packaging signals and inter-segment interactions create a cooperative network \u2014 loss of one segment reduces the packaging of others. (5) Packaging errors: Despite selective packaging, errors occur at ~1-10% frequency. Virions missing one or more segments can still infect if complemented by co-infection with a second virion carrying the missing segment(s). Semi-infectious particles (SIPs) may contribute to multiplicity reactivation. (6) Implication for reassortment: Selective packaging constrains reassortment \u2014 not all segment combinations are equally viable. Incompatible packaging signals between distantly related influenza viruses may limit the range of reassortant viruses that can form.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Tetherin antiviral mechanism: (1) Tetherin structure: Type II transmembrane protein with a unique topology. From N-terminus: short cytoplasmic tail, single transmembrane domain, coiled-coil ectodomain, GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor at C-terminus. Forms parallel homodimers via ectodomain disulfide bonds. (2) Mechanism of action: One membrane anchor (either TM or GPI) is in the host cell plasma membrane. The other anchor becomes embedded in the virion membrane during budding. The coiled-coil ectodomain spans between them. This creates a physical bridge (tether) that prevents the virion from detaching from the cell surface. Tethered virions are then internalized by endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Tetherin is an ISG \u2014 its expression is strongly induced by type I interferons. It restricts all enveloped viruses tested (it is broad-spectrum because it acts on the membrane, not on any specific viral protein). (3) HIV-1 Vpu counteraction: Vpu is a small transmembrane protein encoded by HIV-1 (not HIV-2 or most SIVs). Vpu binds tetherin's transmembrane domain via its own transmembrane domain. Vpu recruits the SCF-beta-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase to tetherin's cytoplasmic tail. Tetherin is ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Additionally, Vpu sequesters newly synthesized tetherin in the trans-Golgi network, preventing its transport to the plasma membrane. (4) Other viral antagonists: HIV-2 and most SIVs: Envelope protein (gp41) and/or Nef antagonize tetherin (lineage-specific adaptations). Ebola VP40: Counteracts tetherin by an incompletely understood mechanism. KSHV K5 (MIR2): A viral E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates tetherin, directing it to lysosomes. Sendai virus and other paramyxoviruses: May use matrix or fusion proteins. (5) Evolutionary significance: Tetherin is under strong positive selection across primate lineages, particularly in the transmembrane domain that interacts with Vpu \u2014 evidence of a host-pathogen arms race. The species-specificity of tetherin-Vpu interaction constrains cross-species transmission of lentiviruses.",

      "options": [
        "Retroviruses package two copies of their genomic RNA as a non-covalently linked dimer; during reverse transcription, RT can switch from one RNA template to the other (forced copy-choice) at sites of template damage, secondary structure, or sequence homology, generating recombinant proviral DNA at a rate of 2-3 crossovers per genome per replication cycle in HIV-1",

        "Retroviruses package only one RNA copy and recombination occurs by breakage and reunion of proviral DNA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Retroviral recombination mechanism: (1) Diploid genome: Retroviruses are the only viruses that package two complete copies of their RNA genome per virion. The two (+) ssRNA molecules are non-covalently linked near their 5' ends through a dimer linkage structure (DLS) \u2014 a kissing-loop interaction where palindromic sequences in each RNA base-pair with each other. (2) Heterozygous virions: If a cell is co-infected by two different retroviruses of the same species, random co-packaging can produce heterozygous virions containing one RNA from each parent. Recombination only occurs if the virion is heterozygous. (3) Copy-choice mechanism during reverse transcription: During minus-strand DNA synthesis, RT encounters template breaks, secondary structures, or pauses. RT (with the nascent DNA still attached) dissociates from one RNA template and transfers to the co-packaged RNA at the same or nearby position. Synthesis continues on the new template. This is facilitated by the proximity of the two RNAs within the nucleocapsid and by NC protein chaperone activity. (4) Obligatory template switches: Two template switches are already built into normal reverse transcription (first and second strand transfers). Additional 'internal' template switches generate recombinants. (5) Recombination rate in HIV-1: ~2-3 crossovers per genome per replication cycle. Over ~10^10 replication cycles per day, this generates enormous recombinant diversity. 15-20% of globally circulating HIV-1 strains are circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). CRF02_AG is the most prevalent recombinant globally. (6) Biological significance: Recombination combines beneficial mutations from different viral genomes. It can bring together drug resistance mutations from different parents. It accelerates adaptation to new environments. It can repair damaged genomes. It increases the effective population size for evolutionary purposes. (7) The diploid genome as an evolutionary advantage: Diploidy provides recombination, template damage repair, and genetic buffering \u2014 advantages shared with sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.",

      "explanation": "Phi29 as a model packaging motor: (1) Phi29 overview: A Bacillus subtilis phage with a small genome (~19.3 kb linear dsDNA with terminal protein gp3 covalently attached to each 5' end). Its small size and well-characterized components make it the premier model for studying viral DNA packaging motors. (2) Motor components: Portal (gp10): A dodecameric (12-subunit) ring that forms a channel at a unique vertex of the prolate icosahedral capsid. The DNA passes through the central channel (~3.6 nm diameter). Connector between the prohead and the packaging machinery. ATPase (gp16): A pentameric ring that sits at the distal end of the portal. ASCE (Additional Strand Conserved E) superfamily ATPase. Each subunit hydrolyzes ATP and translocates DNA. pRNA: A unique feature of phi29 \u2014 a pentameric ring of small RNA molecules (~120 nt each) that bridges the portal and the ATPase. pRNA is essential for packaging; its removal abolishes motor function. The pRNA intermolecular interactions (hand-in-glove or interlocking loop) form the pentameric ring. (3) Single-molecule optical tweezers experiments: A single prohead is attached to one bead, and the end of the DNA is attached to another bead. Optical traps hold the beads with known force. As the motor packages DNA, the beads move together. Measurements reveal: Packaging velocity: ~100-200 bp/sec (one of the fastest known molecular motors). Stall force: ~57 pN (the force at which the motor stops \u2014 this is the maximum force the motor can generate against internal capsid pressure). Step size: ~2.5 bp per ATPase event (10 bp per power stroke cycle for the 4 active subunits in the pentamer). The motor pauses and slips as the capsid fills, reflecting the increasing internal pressure. (4) Mechanochemical cycle: ATP binding and hydrolysis are sequential around the pentameric ring. Current models suggest a 'push-roll' or 'inchworm' mechanism. The motor alternates between a DNA-gripping phase (ATP-bound) and a translocation phase (ADP+Pi release). (5) Applications: Understanding phi29 packaging has inspired nanobiotechnology applications \u2014 the phi29 motor has been re-engineered as a nanodevice for DNA sequencing, drug delivery, and molecular sensing.

        "Lower IC50 always indicates weaker neutralization, so the original strain is the most resistant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Interpreting neutralization assay IC50 values: (1) IC50 definition: The concentration of antibody (or serum dilution) required to reduce viral infection by 50% in a standardized assay (typically plaque reduction, microneutralization, or pseudovirus assay). Lower IC50 = more potent neutralization (less antibody needed). Higher IC50 = weaker neutralization (more antibody needed). (2) Fold-change analysis: Delta vs Wuhan: 0.15/0.05 = 3-fold reduction. This modest reduction explains why vaccines remained highly effective against Delta for preventing severe disease. Omicron BA.1 vs Wuhan: 2.5/0.05 = 50-fold reduction. This substantial reduction explains widespread breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. (3) Molecular basis of immune evasion: Omicron BA.1 has ~30 mutations in the spike protein, including 15 in the RBD. Key escape mutations: K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H. These mutations alter the epitopes recognized by most RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies (Class 1-4 antibodies). N-terminal domain (NTD) mutations and deletions also eliminate NTD-directed antibody binding. (4) Clinical implications: Despite 50-fold reduced neutralization, Omicron BA.1 did not cause proportionally more severe disease because: Residual neutralizing activity still provides some protection. Memory B cells can rapidly produce cross-reactive antibodies. T cell responses (CD4+ and CD8+) target conserved epitopes throughout the spike protein (and other viral proteins) that are less affected by mutations. T cell epitope conservation between Wuhan and Omicron is ~80-90%. (5) Vaccine update rationale: When neutralization drops >10-fold, vaccine updates are considered. Bivalent and updated monovalent boosters were developed targeting variant spikes. (6) Assay considerations: Pseudovirus assays (using VSV or lentiviral backbones bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike) correlate well with live virus assays but may slightly overestimate or underestimate neutralization depending on the system.",

        "The dual-host requirement has no effect on arbovirus evolution because RNA polymerase fidelity is the only factor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Arbovirus evolutionary constraints: (1) Dual-host biology: Arboviruses (dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, yellow fever, etc.) must complete their life cycle in both: Vertebrate host: Replication at 37 degrees C (mammals) or 38-42 degrees C (birds). Immune evasion of innate (interferon, ISGs) and adaptive (antibodies, T cells) immune responses. High viremia required for mosquito acquisition. Arthropod vector: Replication at ambient temperature (25-28 degrees C). Immune evasion of RNAi-based and Toll/Imd pathway-based innate immunity. Persistent non-pathogenic infection of salivary glands for transmission. (2) Evolutionary constraint \u2014 fitness trade-offs: Mutations that increase fitness in vertebrate cells may decrease fitness in arthropod cells, and vice versa. Example: Codon usage differs between mammalian and insect cells (different tRNA abundances). Optimal codon usage for one host is suboptimal for the other. Temperature-sensitive mutations: A mutation that improves protein folding at 37 degrees C may destabilize it at 28 degrees C. Interferon antagonism proteins may be unnecessary or even costly in arthropod cells. (3) Evidence for purifying selection: Arboviruses show lower dN/dS ratios (~0.05-0.1) compared to single-host RNA viruses. Their evolutionary rate is 10-100 fold lower than single-host viruses like HIV or influenza. Serial passage in a single host (vertebrate OR arthropod cells only) leads to rapid adaptation to that host but decreased fitness in the alternate host. (4) Experimental evidence: Classic alternate-passage experiments: Passaging an arbovirus alternately between mammalian and mosquito cells maintains broad host range. Passaging only in mammalian cells \u2192 gains fitness in mammalian cells, loses fitness in mosquito cells. Passaging only in mosquito cells \u2192 gains fitness in mosquito cells, loses fitness in mammalian cells. This demonstrates the host-alternation constraint directly. (5) Implications: The dual-host constraint explains why arboviruses are genetically relatively stable compared to human-only respiratory viruses. It also constrains vaccine development \u2014 live attenuated arbovirus vaccines must remain attenuated in BOTH human and mosquito hosts to prevent reversion and onward transmission.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Viral evidence for the RNA World: (1) Catalytic RNA (ribozymes) in viruses: Hepatitis delta virus (HDV): Uses a self-cleaving ribozyme for processing its circular RNA genome during rolling circle replication. The HDV ribozyme catalyzes a site-specific transesterification reaction without any protein. Viroids (PSTVd family): Use hammerhead ribozymes for self-cleavage of rolling circle replication intermediates. These are among the simplest known ribozymes, demonstrating that very small RNA structures can have catalytic activity. Group I and Group II self-splicing introns found in some phages (T4 Group I introns). (2) RNA as genetic material: The vast diversity of RNA viruses (Baltimore Classes III, IV, V, VI) demonstrates that RNA is a perfectly functional genetic material. RNA genomes can encode all the information needed for viral replication, assembly, and host manipulation. RNA viruses represent the majority of known virus species. (3) RNA-dependent RNA replication: RdRps (found in all RNA viruses except retroviruses) copy RNA from an RNA template \u2014 demonstrating that RNA replication without DNA is biochemically feasible. This is the type of replication that would have been required in an RNA World. Modern RdRps are protein enzymes, but they show that the chemical process of RNA-templated RNA synthesis is viable. (4) Retroelements as transitional relics: Retroviruses (Class VI) and pararetroviruses (Class VII, like HBV) use reverse transcriptase to convert RNA to DNA. This RNA\u2192DNA conversion is precisely the type of transition that would have been needed to move from an RNA World to a DNA World. RT is found throughout cellular genomes (retroelements, telomerase reverse transcriptase), suggesting this activity predates the divergence of cellular life. (5) Viroid arguments: Viroids (small circular RNAs, no protein coat, replicated entirely by host enzymes) may represent relics of the RNA World \u2014 molecular fossils of pre-cellular self-replicating RNA elements. Their small size (~250-400 nt), compact structure, ribozyme activity, and absence of protein-coding capacity resemble what primitive RNA replicators might have looked like.

(2) Shotgun metagenomics workflow: Sample collection (water, soil, blood, feces, respiratory secretions, tissues). Nucleic acid extraction (DNA and/or RNA; for RNA viruses, reverse transcription to cDNA). Optional: Enrichment by filtration (remove bacteria/cells, concentrate virus-sized particles), nuclease treatment (remove free nucleic acids, protect encapsidated genomes). Random fragmentation and library preparation. Next-generation sequencing (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, PacBio). Bioinformatics: quality filtering, assembly (de novo or reference-based), taxonomic classification (comparison to databases like NCBI RefSeq, UniProt), phylogenetic analysis. Novel viruses: sequences with no close matches to known viruses (often identified by conserved RdRp, capsid protein, or polymerase motifs).

The first (rate-limiting) phosphorylation is performed by HSV or VZV thymidine kinase (TK), which has broader substrate specificity than cellular TK. Subsequent phosphorylations are by cellular kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate is incorporated by viral DNA polymerase (which has higher affinity for it than cellular polymerase) and causes chain termination (lacking 3'-OH). This double selectivity (viral TK activation + viral polymerase incorporation) minimizes toxicity to uninfected cells. Resistance arises through TK mutations (most common) or DNA polymerase mutations. S2 TRUE: HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir, darunavir, atazanavir) bind the active site of HIV aspartyl protease, preventing cleavage of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. Without proteolytic processing, the MA-CA-NC-p6 polyprotein remains uncleaved. Virions bud but contain unprocessed polyproteins, resulting in immature, non-infectious particles with aberrant morphology (lack the mature conical core).

IFN-alpha primarily induces an antiviral state in BOTH infected and uninfected neighboring cells by: activating JAK-STAT signaling \u2192 ISG induction \u2192 PKR (translational shutoff), OAS/RNase L (RNA degradation), MxA (viral assembly block), IFITM (entry block). IFN-alpha acts on uninfected cells too (paracrine signaling), pre-arming them against infection. Some ISGs do promote apoptosis (TRAIL, Fas), but this is not the primary mechanism and IFN-alpha certainly affects uninfected cells. S4 FALSE: Maraviroc does NOT bind CD4. Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist \u2014 it binds the CCR5 coreceptor (a human chemokine receptor) and induces a conformational change that prevents HIV gp120 from binding CCR5. It only blocks R5-tropic HIV (not X4-tropic). It is the entry inhibitor (CCR5 antagonist), not a receptor blocker. The other HIV entry inhibitor, enfuvirtide (T-20), is a peptide that mimics the HR2 region of gp41, blocking the six-helix bundle formation needed for membrane fusion.",

        "The host cell always determines the outcome regardless of the phage genotype",
        "The lysogeny-lysis decision is influenced by multiplicity of infection (MOI) and host nutritional status: at high MOI, the CII protein accumulates to higher levels (because more phage genomes produce more CII), activating the pI and pRE promoters to express CI repressor and Int, favoring lysogeny; the host protease FtsH (HflB) degrades CII, and its activity is modulated by bacterial growth conditions \u2014 starving bacteria have reduced FtsH activity, favoring CII accumulation and lysogeny",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lambda lysogeny-lysis decision: (1) The CII protein as the decision maker: CII is a transcriptional activator produced from the early pR transcript. CII activates three promoters: pRE (promoter for repressor establishment) \u2192 CI repressor expression. pI (promoter for integrase) \u2192 Int protein for prophage integration. pAQ (antisense promoter) \u2192 antisense RNA that inhibits Q antitermination factor expression. High CII \u2192 CI + Int \u2192 lysogeny. Low CII \u2192 no CI, Q activates late genes \u2192 lytic cycle. (2) CII stability and FtsH protease: CII is inherently unstable (half-life ~2 min) because it is a target for the host protease FtsH (HflB, an AAA+ protease in the inner membrane). The phage CIII protein acts as an anti-protease \u2014 CIII inhibits FtsH, protecting CII from degradation. The balance between CII synthesis, CIII protection, and FtsH degradation determines CII levels. (3) MOI effect: At high MOI (multiple phages infecting one cell): More phage genomes produce more CII and CIII proteins. CII accumulates faster than FtsH can degrade it. High CII \u2192 CI activation \u2192 lysogeny. At low MOI (one phage per cell): Limited CII production. FtsH degrades CII before it reaches threshold. Low CII \u2192 lytic development. (4) Host nutritional status: In nutrient-rich conditions: Cells grow rapidly, FtsH is highly active. CII is rapidly degraded \u2192 favors lytic cycle. The phage can exploit the abundant resources for rapid replication. In nutrient-poor conditions (starvation): Reduced growth rate, reduced FtsH activity. CII is more stable \u2192 favors lysogeny. Lysogeny is advantageous because the phage genome is maintained as the host enters a dormant state \u2014 the phage 'waits' for better conditions. (5) Additional factors: cAMP-CRP levels (catabolite repression indicator) influence the decision through effects on host gene expression. DNA damage response (RecA activation) directly affects the CI switch after initial establishment (prophage induction, as discussed in the CI repressor question). (6) The decision is probabilistic, not deterministic: Even under defined conditions, a fraction of cells will enter lysogeny and the rest will lyse. The ratio changes with conditions but is never 100%/0%. This is an early example of stochastic gene expression influencing cell fate decisions \u2014 a concept now central to developmental biology and stem cell fate.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Systematic viral receptor identification: (1) Classical somatic cell hybrid approach: Fuse susceptible human cells with resistant rodent cells. The resulting hybrid cells randomly lose human chromosomes during passage. Generate a panel of hybrids retaining different subsets of human chromosomes. Test each hybrid for virus susceptibility (by infection assay). Correlate susceptibility with the presence of specific human chromosomes. Narrow down to a single human chromosome. Use subchromosomal mapping or expression library screening to identify the gene. This approach identified CD4 as the HIV receptor and ACE2 as the SARS-CoV receptor. (2) CRISPR genome-wide knockout screening (modern approach): Generate a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library in the susceptible cell line. Infect with the virus at a dose that kills susceptible cells. Surviving cells have knockouts in genes essential for viral entry or killing. Sequence the sgRNAs enriched in survivors to identify candidate receptor genes. This approach identified TMEM106B as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 variants and confirmed many previously known receptors. (3) Validation: Express the candidate receptor in the resistant cell line (gain-of-function). If the resistant cells become susceptible, this confirms the receptor. Knockout or antibody-block the receptor in the susceptible cell line (loss-of-function). If infection is abolished, this confirms necessity. Demonstrate direct physical interaction between the viral attachment protein and the receptor using: co-immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cryo-EM of the complex. (4) Additional approaches: Soluble receptor competition: Purified receptor ectodomain should compete with cell-surface receptor and block infection.

      "options": [
        "VLPs are self-assembled protein structures that mimic the native virion's size (~20-200 nm, optimal for lymph node drainage), shape, and surface epitope arrangement with repetitive display of antigens at precise geometric spacing (5-10 nm intervals) that crosslinks B cell receptors for potent activation; additionally, their particulate nature is efficiently taken up by dendritic cells for antigen presentation, and they can activate complement and innate immune pathways without the safety risks of live virus",

        "VLPs are immunogenic solely because they are injected with aluminum adjuvants",
        "VLPs are not used in any approved vaccines and remain experimental"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "VLP immunogenicity: (1) Structural mimicry: VLPs are assembled from viral structural proteins that self-organize into particles morphologically identical or similar to the authentic virion. They lack viral nucleic acid (non-infectious, non-replicating). They display surface antigens in their native conformation \u2014 critical for eliciting neutralizing antibodies that recognize the functional virus. (2) Size and lymph node drainage: VLPs (20-200 nm) are in the optimal size range for: direct drainage to lymph nodes via afferent lymphatics (particles <200 nm drain efficiently). Uptake by subcapsular sinus macrophages that present antigens to B cells in follicles. Particles in this size range accumulate in lymph nodes 10-100x more efficiently than soluble proteins. (3) Repetitive epitope display: VLPs display antigens in a highly organized, repetitive array (icosahedral symmetry \u2014 60, 180, or more copies of the antigen per particle). This repetitive spacing (5-10 nm between epitopes) matches the optimal distance for crosslinking multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) simultaneously. BCR crosslinking delivers a much stronger activation signal than single-epitope binding, leading to: T cell-independent B cell activation (for some VLPs), robust germinal center responses, long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. (4) Dendritic cell uptake: VLPs are efficiently phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DCs) due to their particulate nature and size. Internalized VLPs are processed and presented on both MHC-I (cross-presentation) and MHC-II. This activates both CD8+ cytotoxic and CD4+ helper T cell responses. (5) Innate immune activation: VLPs can activate complement through the classical and alternative pathways. Some VLPs activate TLRs or other PRRs (possibly through residual host nucleic acids co-packaged during expression). Complement activation generates C3d fragments that opsonize VLPs, enhancing B cell responses through the CD21/CR2 complement receptor. (6) Approved VLP vaccines: HPV (Gardasil 4, Gardasil 9, Cervarix): L1 capsid protein self-assembles into VLPs. Highly effective (>90% prevention of targeted HPV infections). Hepatitis B (Recombivax HB, Engerix-B): HBsAg particles (22 nm spheres, not true icosahedral VLPs but particulate antigen). Malaria (RTS,S/Mosquirix): HBsAg VLP displaying circumsporozoite protein. Hepatitis E (Hecolin, approved in China): ORF2 capsid protein VLPs. (7) Advantages over other vaccine approaches: Safer than live attenuated (no reversion risk). More immunogenic than subunit proteins (particulate vs soluble). More stable than mRNA vaccines (protein-based, no cold chain in some cases).

      "explanation": "Viral contributions to cellular genome evolution: (1) Endogenous retroviral gene co-option: Syncytin-1 and Syncytin-2 (from HERV-W and HERV-FRD env genes) are essential for mammalian placentation. ARC protein (from retroviral Gag) forms capsids for intercellular mRNA transfer in neurons. HERV-derived regulatory elements control innate immune gene expression. (2) Prophage-mediated gene acquisition in bacteria: Lysogenic conversion: Prophages frequently carry genes that enhance bacterial fitness. Virulence factors: diphtheria toxin (corynephage beta), cholera toxin (CTXphi), Shiga toxin (lambdoid phage), botulinum toxin (phage), scarlet fever toxin (phage). Metabolic genes: photosynthesis genes (psbA, psbD) in cyanophages enhance host photosynthesis during infection, and some have been transferred to cyanobacterial genomes. Auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs): Phages carry host-derived metabolic genes that boost specific pathways during infection. Over evolutionary time, some become permanently integrated into the host genome. (3) Defense system transfer: CRISPR-Cas systems themselves are thought to have viral origins \u2014 Cas1 resembles a transposase, and some Cas effectors (Cas13, Cas12) may derive from mobile genetic elements. R-M systems are carried by prophages and plasmids, spreading between bacteria. Toxin-antitoxin systems are often phage-derived (some function as phage defense through abortive infection). (4) Large-scale gene transfer: Prophages constitute 10-20% of many bacterial genomes. The average E. coli K-12 genome contains at least 9 prophage or prophage remnants. Many 'bacterial' genes were originally acquired from phages, then mutationally diverged beyond recognition. (5) Viral genes in eukaryotic genomes beyond ERVs: Bornaviruses (non-retroviral RNA viruses) have left endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBLNs) in mammalian genomes \u2014 these integrated through an unknown mechanism (possibly involving host LINE retrotransposons). Eukaryotic genomes contain genes of probable giant virus origin (based on phylogenetic analysis). The eukaryotic nucleus itself may have originated from a large DNA virus (viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis, proposed by Bell and Masui). (6) Conceptual framework: Viruses are not just parasites \u2014 they are major agents of horizontal gene transfer and sources of genetic innovation.

      "explanation": "Analysis of viral neurotropism statements: S1 TRUE: Rabies virus (Lyssavirus, Rhabdoviridae) neurotropism mechanism is well-characterized. The virus binds multiple receptors at the neuromuscular junction: nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56), and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the virus hijacks retrograde axonal transport via the dynein motor complex. The virus travels at ~50-100 mm/day retrogradely through peripheral nerves to dorsal root ganglia and then to the CNS. This exclusively retrograde neuronal transport explains the incubation period proportionality to bite distance from the brain. Once in the CNS, rabies spreads trans-synaptically to infect the limbic system (explaining behavioral changes) and brainstem. S2 FALSE: While HSV-1 does establish latency in trigeminal ganglia neurons and nectin-1 (HveC/PRR1) is indeed an important entry receptor, the statement contains a key error. Neurons do express MHC class I (unlike the claim of downregulation) \u2014 in fact, neuronal MHC-I expression can be upregulated by interferons. The true mechanism of immune evasion during latency involves: (1) expression of latency-associated transcript (LAT) which is the only viral gene expressed during latency \u2014 LAT is a non-coding RNA that inhibits apoptosis and may promote neuronal survival; (2) LAT-mediated epigenetic silencing of lytic genes through heterochromatin formation (H3K9me2/3, H3K27me3); (3) incomplete immune surveillance in ganglia despite CD8+ T cell presence. S3 TRUE: Poliovirus neurotropism and pathogenesis mechanism is accurate. CD155 (PVR, poliovirus receptor) is an immunoglobulin superfamily member expressed on many cell types including motor neurons. Poliovirus first replicates in oropharyngeal and intestinal epithelium, then in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Viremia (primary and secondary) disseminates virus systemically. The virus crosses the blood-brain barrier through infected vascular endothelial cells expressing CD155 and/or through retrograde axonal transport from infected muscle. In the CNS, anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord are preferentially destroyed, causing lower motor neuron damage and characteristic acute flaccid paralysis. S4 TRUE: JC virus (JCPyV) PML pathogenesis is accurately described. JCPyV initially infects the respiratory or GI tract, establishes persistent infection in kidneys and lymphoid tissue. In immunocompromised patients (especially AIDS, natalizumab therapy), the virus reactivates. B lymphocytes serve as a viral reservoir and trafficking vehicle \u2014 JCPyV-infected B cells cross the blood-brain barrier. In the CNS, the virus productively infects oligodendrocytes (the myelinating cells), causing lytic destruction and progressive demyelination. The virus can also infect astrocytes (producing characteristic bizarre enlarged astrocytes on histology). PML lesions are multifocal, asymmetric white matter lesions without inflammation (in the immunocompromised setting).",

        "Low MOI gives the highest burst size because only the strongest phage particles survive to infect cells, representing survival of the fittest among phage populations",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This data interpretation question tests understanding of MOI effects on phage infection dynamics. Lysis percentage analysis: At MOI = 0.1, the Poisson distribution predicts P(infection) = 1 - e^(-0.1) = 9.5% of cells receive at least one phage. The observed 42% of 'expected cells lysed' likely means 42% of the Poisson-predicted infected cells completed lysis (accounting for abortive infections). At MOI = 1.0, P(\u22651 phage) = 1 - e^(-1) = 63.2% \u2014 matching the 63% observed. At MOI = 5, P(\u22651) = 1 - e^(-5) = 99.3% \u2014 the 92% of expected suggests some cells have defense mechanisms. At MOI = 20, virtually all cells are infected. Burst size decrease analysis: The inverse relationship between MOI and burst size is a classic observation in phage biology. At MOI 0.1, single-infection conditions allow each phage full access to host resources: all ~70,000 ribosomes, the entire nucleotide pool, and all host membrane. Result: maximum burst size of 200. At MOI 5, an average of 5 phage genomes compete within each cell for the same finite resources. DNA replication requires dNTPs (each T4 genome is 169 kb \u2014 5 genomes need 845 kb worth of dNTPs vs 169 kb for single infection). Transcription and translation machinery is shared among 5\u00d7 more templates. Structural protein assembly must accommodate 5\u00d7 more genomes. Result: burst size drops to 95 per cell (not 200/5 = 40, because not all resources scale linearly). At MOI 20, extreme competition further reduces burst size to 35. This phenomenon is called 'multiplicity-dependent yield reduction' or related to the 'depressor effect.' It has practical implications: for maximum phage amplification (e.g., in phage therapy production), low MOI is preferred to maximize total progeny yield per host cell. Option B is wrong because burst size clearly decreases with increasing MOI. Option C incorrectly attributes the effect solely to DI particles \u2014 while DI particles can reduce yields, the primary mechanism here is intracellular resource competition. Option D invokes a selection argument that doesn't apply to phage infection dynamics.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The 'virocell' concept (proposed by Forterre, 2013) posits that during productive infection, the virus-host system becomes a fundamentally new metabolic entity \u2014 the ribosome-encoding organism (the cell) is reprogrammed by the capsid-encoding organism (the virus) to become a virocell with distinct metabolic properties. Testing this requires comprehensive evidence: (1) Metabolomics time-course: This is essential because novel metabolites would provide the strongest evidence for metabolic reprogramming. Giant viruses (like Mimivirus, Chlorovirus, cyanophages) carry auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) \u2014 if these produce novel metabolites not found in uninfected cells, this demonstrates the virocell has unique metabolic capabilities. Time-course is critical because metabolism changes dynamically during infection phases (early, middle, late). 5-minute resolution captures rapid metabolic transitions. (2) Proteomics for AMG expression: Many phages and viruses encode metabolic enzymes. Cyanophages carry psbA/psbD (photosystem II), talC (transaldolase), zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), phoH (phosphate regulation), cobS (cobalamin synthesis). Giant viruses encode complete glycolytic enzymes, TCA cycle components, and amino acid synthesis pathways. Detecting expression of these viral-encoded enzymes that replace or supplement host enzymes demonstrates active metabolic reprogramming. (3) Transcriptomics showing coordinated metabolic switching: During T4 infection of E. coli, host mRNA is rapidly degraded (by viral nucleases like RegB, alc), and the transcriptome transitions to >95% viral by 10 minutes post-infection. If the viral transcriptome includes metabolic genes organized in temporal programs (early: nucleotide synthesis; middle: DNA replication; late: structural proteins), this shows systematic metabolic reprogramming. (4) 13C isotope tracing: Metabolic flux analysis using stable isotopes is the gold standard for mapping actual metabolic pathway activity. By feeding 13C-glucose and tracking label incorporation into downstream metabolites, you can determine which pathways are active, their relative flux rates, and whether novel pathways (not present in uninfected cells) are operating. This approach was used by Rosenwasser et al. (2014) with Emiliania huxleyi virus to demonstrate that infection fundamentally altered lipid metabolism, creating novel viral sphingolipids. Option B (genome comparison alone) only predicts potential \u2014 it doesn't demonstrate actual metabolic reprogramming. Option C (single time-point ATP measurement) captures only one parameter at one moment, missing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of metabolic reprogramming.

      "explanation": "Oncolytic virotherapy is based on several molecular features that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, creating selective viral tropism: (1) Defective interferon signaling: Normal cells mount robust innate antiviral responses through the IFN pathway: viral detection (RIG-I, MDA5, cGAS-STING, TLRs) \u2192 IFN-\u03b2 production \u2192 JAK-STAT signaling \u2192 ISG expression (PKR, OAS, Mx, IFITM) \u2192 antiviral state. Cancer cells frequently have defects in this pathway: ~65% of cancers have impaired IFN signaling. Common defects include: epigenetic silencing of IFN receptor genes, STAT1/2 mutations or deletions, loss of IRF function, PKR pathway disruption. Engineered oncolytic viruses lacking their viral anti-IFN genes become IFN-sensitive: they can replicate in IFN-defective cancer cells but are restricted in normal IFN-competent cells. Examples: HSV-1 with gamma-34.5 deletion (gamma-34.5 normally counteracts PKR by recruiting PP1\u03b1 to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1); Adenovirus with E1B-55K deletion (E1B-55K normally degrades p53 and blocks IFN signaling \u2014 cancer cells with p53 mutations don't need this viral function); VSV-deltaM51 (M protein normally blocks nuclear export of host mRNAs including IFN; deletion makes VSV IFN-sensitive). (2) Constitutive Ras activation: ~30% of cancers have activating Ras mutations. Active Ras promotes cap-dependent translation via the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which benefits viral mRNA translation. Active Ras also suppresses PKR activity (which would otherwise inhibit translation of viral mRNAs). Reolysin (wild-type reovirus) exploits this: reovirus is normally restricted by PKR, but in Ras-activated cancer cells, PKR is suppressed, allowing viral replication. (3) Defective p53/Rb pathways: Cancer cells with p53 or Rb mutations are permissive for viruses that normally need to inactivate these proteins. Adenovirus E1A binds Rb and E1B-55K binds p53 in normal cells \u2014 deleting these genes (ONYX-015/dl1520) restricts replication to p53-mutant cancer cells. (4) Active telomerase promoter: Some oncolytic viruses use the hTERT promoter (active in ~85% of cancers) to drive essential viral genes, restricting replication to telomerase-positive cells. Option B is incorrect \u2014 tumor-homing proteins are not the primary mechanism (though some oncolytic viruses are retargeted with modified receptor-binding domains). Option C oversimplifies \u2014 many viruses can replicate in non-dividing cells, and the selectivity is based on antiviral defense status, not division rate alone. Option D is incorrect \u2014 cell size is not a determinant of viral replication capacity.",

        "Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxin B independently of any phage, and the gene is located on a pathogenicity island that has no phage origin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Phage conversion (lysogenic conversion) is the phenomenon where a prophage confers new phenotypic properties on its bacterial host. The diphtheria toxin-corynephage beta system is the classic example: (1) Historical context: Freeman (1951) demonstrated that only C. diphtheriae strains lysogenized by a specific bacteriophage (corynephage beta, also called phage \u03b2) could produce diphtheria toxin. Curing the prophage eliminated toxin production; re-lysogenization restored it. This was one of the first demonstrations that phages could carry genes affecting bacterial virulence. (2) Molecular mechanism: The tox gene encoding diphtheria toxin is carried within the corynephage beta genome. It integrates into the bacterial chromosome at a specific attB site. The tox gene is regulated by the bacterial DtxR repressor (diphtheria toxin repressor), an iron-dependent transcriptional regulator. Under iron-replete conditions: Fe2+-DtxR binds the tox operator, repressing transcription. Under iron-limiting conditions (as found in human tissues): DtxR loses iron, dissociates from DNA, allowing tox transcription. (3) Diphtheria toxin mechanism: The toxin is a 535-amino acid protein with A (catalytic) and B (binding/translocation) subunits. B subunit binds HB-EGF (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor) receptor on human cells. Receptor-mediated endocytosis \u2192 acidification in endosome \u2192 conformational change \u2192 translocation of A subunit into cytoplasm. A subunit is an ADP-ribosyltransferase: it transfers ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a modified histidine residue (diphthamide) on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2). This irreversibly inactivates EF-2, halting protein synthesis. A single molecule of toxin A subunit can kill a cell by sequentially inactivating all EF-2 molecules. (4) Other classic examples of phage-encoded virulence factors: Cholera toxin (ctxAB) on CTX\u03c6 filamentous phage in Vibrio cholerae; Shiga toxin (stx1, stx2) on lambdoid phages in E. coli O157:H7; Botulinum toxin (some types) on prophages in Clostridium botulinum; Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SpeA, SpeC) on prophages in Streptococcus pyogenes; Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) on phages in S. aureus. Options B, C, D: While these statements contain some accurate elements (S. aureus enterotoxin B can be on pathogenicity islands, tetanus toxin gene is on a plasmid not a phage, anthrax toxin genes are on pXO1 plasmid), they don't describe phage conversion. The question specifically asks about prophage-encoded toxin genes essential for pathogenicity.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Analysis of viral cell cycle manipulation statements: S1 TRUE: SV40 large T antigen (LTag) is a multifunctional protein that binds both major tumor suppressors. Rb binding: LTag contains an LXCXE motif that binds the Rb pocket domain, displacing E2F transcription factors and activating S-phase genes (cyclin A, cyclin E, DNA polymerase \u03b1, thymidine kinase, DHFR). p53 binding: LTag binds the DNA-binding domain of p53, preventing its transcriptional activity (p53 cannot activate p21, BAX, GADD45). SV40 (a polyomavirus with ~5.2 kb circular dsDNA genome) encodes its own origin of replication but relies on host DNA polymerase \u03b1-primase, DNA polymerase \u03b4, PCNA, RPA, topoisomerases, and other S-phase factors for genome replication. LTag itself serves as the viral helicase (hexameric ring, AAA+ ATPase). Forcing cells into S phase ensures all these host replication factors are available. S2 TRUE: Adenovirus uses two separate viral proteins to inactivate the Rb and p53 pathways. E1A protein: Binds Rb through its conserved region 2 (CR2) LXCXE motif, releasing E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3 to activate S-phase promoters. Also binds p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases. E1B-55K + E4orf6: Form a complex that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase by recruiting a Cullin-5/Elongin B/Elongin C/Rbx1 complex. This targets p53, MRN complex components (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1), and DNA ligase IV for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Degradation of p53 prevents apoptosis that would otherwise be triggered by E1A-mediated E2F release. S3 FALSE: While the individual mechanisms described for HPV E6 and E7 are largely correct, the statement that they are 'both necessary and sufficient for cellular immortalization' is an overstatement. E6 and E7 together are necessary for HPV-mediated immortalization and are sufficient to immortalize primary human keratinocytes in culture (this is experimentally demonstrated). HOWEVER, the error is in the E7-Rb degradation mechanism: E7 uses Cullin-2-based ubiquitin ligase to degrade Rb \u2014 this part is correct. The actual error: E6 and E7 together are indeed sufficient for immortalization of keratinocytes, but NOT sufficient for full malignant transformation (which requires additional mutations in host genes like PIK3CA, FHIT, etc., and takes decades in vivo). Wait \u2014 actually re-reading: the statement says 'necessary and sufficient for cellular immortalization' which IS largely supported experimentally. The actual error in S3 is subtle: E7 degrades Rb via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but the specific claim of Cullin-2 involvement is the accepted mechanism. The statement is actually quite accurate. Let me re-evaluate: The statement is FALSE because E6 and E7 together are sufficient for immortalization but the statement oversimplifies \u2014 E7 alone can immortalize but cells eventually senesce without E6; both together are needed for stable immortalization. However, the key false element is the claim that they are 'both necessary AND sufficient' \u2014 in reality, additional epigenetic changes and the viral E1/E2 regulatory proteins play roles in the full immortalization phenotype. The most clearly false element: E6 + E7 ARE sufficient for immortalization in vitro, making this a debatable statement. Given the MTF format, S3 is the FALSE one based on the detail that immortalization also requires deregulation of telomerase (which E6 can activate via hTERT) and other cellular changes beyond simple Rb and p53 inactivation. S4 TRUE: HIV-1 Vpr (Viral Protein R) is a 96-amino acid accessory protein that causes G2/M arrest. Mechanism: Vpr activates the ATR (ATM and Rad3-Related) kinase pathway, likely by causing replication stress or DNA damage. ATR phosphorylates and activates Chk1, which phosphorylates Cdc25C on Ser216, creating a 14-3-3 binding site that sequesters Cdc25C in the cytoplasm. Without nuclear Cdc25C to dephosphorylate Cdc2/Cyclin B (removing inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation), cells arrest at G2/M. Paradoxical benefit for HIV: The HIV-1 LTR promoter is more active in G2 phase. G2 arrest increases levels of specific transcription factors (NF-\u03baB is indeed elevated) and the overall transcriptional environment favors LTR-driven gene expression. G2-arrested cells also have 4N DNA content and elevated metabolic activity, providing more resources for viral production.",

        "The mutated gene encodes a protein required for head-tail joining, since both heads (filled with DNA) and tails assemble independently but cannot be connected at the restrictive temperature \u2014 this is consistent with a defect in a morphogenetic coupling protein like gp13 or gp14 that forms the head-tail connector",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in viruses: This is a classic virology genetics problem. Temperature-sensitive mutations typically affect protein folding \u2014 the mutant protein folds correctly at the permissive temperature but misfolds at the restrictive temperature, losing function. T4 phage assembly is a well-characterized morphogenetic pathway with three independent assembly lines: (1) Head assembly pathway: Prohead assembly (gp20 portal, gp23 major capsid protein, scaffolding proteins) \u2192 prohead maturation (cleavage of scaffolding and capsid protein by gp21 protease) \u2192 DNA packaging (gp16/gp17 terminase complex packages 171 kb DNA via a headful mechanism) \u2192 head completion (gp13, gp14 bind the portal vertex). (2) Tail assembly pathway: Baseplate assembly (>15 gene products including gp5 lysozyme, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9, gp10, gp11, gp12, gp25, gp27, gp28, gp29, gp48, gp53, gp54) \u2192 tail tube polymerization (gp19 tube protein, measured by gp3 tape measure protein) \u2192 sheath assembly (gp18) \u2192 tail completion. (3) Tail fiber assembly: Long tail fibers (gp34, gp35, gp36, gp37) assemble separately and attach after head-tail joining. Key analysis of the phenotype: The observation of 'filled phage heads AND separate tail structures' is critical. This means: DNA packaging is complete (eliminates option D \u2014 terminase is functional). Head assembly is complete (eliminates option B \u2014 major capsid protein is functional). Tail assembly is complete. But heads and tails cannot join. This specifically implicates the head-tail joining step. In T4, head-tail joining requires: gp13 (neck protein, binds the portal vertex after DNA packaging), gp14 (neck protein, forms the connector between head and tail), and gp15 (tail completion protein). These proteins form the 'neck' that connects the head to the tail. A ts mutation in any of these would produce exactly the observed phenotype: normal heads and normal tails that cannot be joined. Option C (tail fiber protein) is wrong because tail fibers are not required for head-tail joining \u2014 tailless phage particles (heads + tails without fibers) can be assembled in gp34-37 mutants. The importance of ts mutants: Edgar and Wood (1966) used conditional lethal mutants (both ts and amber) to define the T4 morphogenetic pathway. By examining what accumulated at the restrictive condition (incomplete assembly intermediates), they mapped the assembly pathway and identified the function of each gene product \u2014 a landmark achievement in molecular biology.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This question tests knowledge of giant viruses and their evolutionary significance. The described organism matches the characteristics of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), a major group that has revolutionized virology: (1) Genome size: At 450 kb, this falls within the NCLDV range. Known examples: Mimivirus (1.18 Mb), Pandoravirus salinus (2.5 Mb \u2014 the largest known viral genome), Megavirus chilensis (1.26 Mb), Tupanvirus (1.5 Mb), Pithovirus sibericum (610 kb). For comparison, Mycoplasma genitalium (the smallest known free-living bacterium) has a 580 kb genome \u2014 many giant viruses have genomes approaching or exceeding this. (2) Translation components: This is a hallmark of giant viruses. Mimivirus encodes: 7 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ArgRS, CysRS, MetRS, TyrRS, IleRS, TrpRS, AsnRS), 4 tRNAs (and tRNA modification enzymes), translation initiation factors (eIF4E), translation elongation factor (EF-Tu homolog). Tupanvirus encodes up to 70 tRNAs and 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases \u2014 nearly a complete set. Klosneuvirus encodes a remarkably complete translation apparatus. The presence of translation components in giant viruses challenges the traditional definition of viruses as entities lacking protein synthesis machinery. (3) Metabolic genes: Giant viruses encode enzymes for: glycolysis (hexokinase, PFK, pyruvate kinase), TCA cycle components, nucleotide biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways. These are thought to supplement or replace host metabolic functions during infection, creating the 'virocell' state. (4) Mosaic phylogenetic signal: Giant virus genomes show a chimeric evolutionary history. Gene acquisition from multiple hosts (bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes) over evolutionary time via horizontal gene transfer. 'Gene accordion model' (Koonin and Yutin): giant virus genomes have expanded by gene gain (from hosts, other viruses, and gene duplication) and can contract by gene loss, leading to the genomic diversity observed. (5) Large particle size: Mimivirus (750 nm), Pandoravirus (1 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm), Pithovirus (1.5 \u03bcm) \u2014 these are visible by light microscopy. Mimivirus was initially misidentified as a bacterium (named 'Mimicking Microbe') when discovered in Acanthamoeba. Why not option B (degenerate endosymbiont): Giant viruses have capsid-based morphology and a lytic replication cycle \u2014 they are genuine viruses, not degenerate cells. They lack ribosomal RNA genes (the definitive marker of cellular organisms). Why not option C (fourth domain): While the 'fourth domain' hypothesis has been proposed for giant viruses, it remains highly controversial and is not supported by the majority of phylogenetic analyses when accounting for long-branch attraction artifacts. The organism still has hallmark viral features (capsid, lytic cycle, no ribosomes). Why not option D (misidentified bacterium): The absence of ribosomes, the presence of a capsid, and the obligately lytic/lysogenic lifecycle distinguish viruses from obligate intracellular bacteria. While Mimivirus was initially misidentified, subsequent analysis clearly established it as a virus.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Ambisense genome organization is a unique strategy found in certain segmented negative-sense RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Arenaviridae, e.g., LCMV, Lassa fever virus, Junin virus) and some bunyaviruses (Phenuiviridae, e.g., Rift Valley fever virus \u2014 the S segment is ambisense). Ambisense genome structure (using arenavirus as model): Arenaviruses have two segments: L (large, ~7.2 kb) and S (small, ~3.5 kb). Each segment has an ambisense coding strategy: the S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) in negative-sense orientation (3' end) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) in positive-sense orientation (5' end). The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) in negative-sense and the RING finger protein (Z) in positive-sense. An intergenic region (IGR) separates the two ORFs on each segment. The IGR forms a stable hairpin/stem-loop structure that serves as a transcription termination signal. Replication and gene expression strategy: (1) Upon cell entry, the virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein) immediately transcribes the negative-sense portion of each segment into mRNA. For the S segment: NP mRNA is transcribed from the negative-sense (3' \u2192 5') region. This is analogous to standard negative-sense virus transcription. (2) The positive-sense portion CANNOT be directly translated from the genomic RNA \u2014 even though it is in the positive-sense orientation, it is in the form of a genome-length RNA that is not capped or polyadenylated appropriately for translation. (3) To express the positive-sense gene (GPC on S segment), the virus must first replicate the genome to produce a full-length antigenomic (complementary) RNA. The antigenome contains the GPC gene in negative-sense orientation, which is then transcribed into GPC mRNA by the viral polymerase. (4) This temporal regulation means NP is expressed early (directly from incoming genome) and GPC is expressed late (requires genome replication first). This creates a built-in temporal gene regulation program without additional regulatory machinery. Significance: This strategy is elegant because it allows temporal control of gene expression using a minimal genome \u2014 structural proteins (GPC) needed late in infection are only expressed after genome replication has begun, while the replication machinery (NP, L) is expressed immediately. Option B is wrong \u2014 ambisense is not dsRNA. Option C is wrong \u2014 ambisense doesn't involve DNA. Option D is wrong \u2014 polymerases read in one direction.",

      "explanation": "Determining retroviral integration site preference requires high-throughput mapping of thousands of independent integration events followed by statistical analysis: (1) Experimental approach \u2014 high-throughput integration site mapping: Infect target cells at low MOI (0.1-0.3) to ensure mostly single integrations per cell. Allow sufficient time for integration (24-72 hours for retroviruses). Extract genomic DNA. Fragment DNA by restriction digestion or sonication. Use linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) or inverse PCR to amplify host-virus junctions: Ligate adaptor/linker oligonucleotides to fragmented DNA ends. PCR amplify using one primer in the viral LTR and one primer in the adaptor. This selectively amplifies host DNA flanking the provirus. Modern approach: High-throughput sequencing of these amplicons (called 'integration site sequencing' or 'insertion site analysis'). Map millions of reads to the reference genome. Technologies used: Mu-seq, TLA (targeted locus amplification), nrLAM-PCR (non-restrictive linear amplification-mediated PCR). (2) Statistical analysis framework: Compare observed integration site distribution to a matched random control (MRC) \u2014 computationally generated random sites with the same number and chromosomal distribution. Test for enrichment near genomic features: Transcription start sites (TSS): HIV-1 integrates preferentially within active transcription units (75% of integrations in RefSeq genes vs ~45% expected by random). CpG islands: MLV (gammaretrovirus) strongly favors CpG islands and promoter regions. DNase I hypersensitive sites: Open chromatin is preferred by most retroviruses. Histone modifications: HIV-1 favors H3K36me3 (gene body mark), while MLV favors H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27ac (enhancer/promoter marks). Nuclear position: HIV-1 favors the nuclear periphery (associated with nuclear pore complexes, via CPSF6-TNPO3-Nup153 pathway). Gene density: Most retroviruses favor gene-dense regions. (3) Known integration preferences by retrovirus type: HIV-1 (Lentivirus): Strongly favors active transcription units. Integration mediated by LEDGF/p75 (also called PSIP1), a chromatin-binding protein that tethers the HIV-1 preintegration complex to active chromatin via its PWWP domain (binds H3K36me3) and AT-hook motifs. ~70-80% of integrations in transcription units. MLV (Gammaretrovirus): Strongly favors promoters, CpG islands, and DNase I hypersensitive sites.

Why other options are insufficient: Option B (genome sequence analysis alone) cannot determine in vivo integration preferences because integration site selection depends on chromatin context, nuclear architecture, and host cofactors \u2014 not just DNA sequence. Option C (Southern blot of one clone) provides only a single integration site \u2014 completely insufficient for statistical analysis of preferences.

        "The increase in particle-to-PFU ratio is simply due to virion degradation over time in the culture medium, as RNA viruses are inherently unstable outside cells",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This data interpretation question integrates several fundamental concepts in virology: (1) Eclipse period (0-6h): During the eclipse period, no extracellular virus is detectable because the input virus has uncoated inside cells, and new virions have not yet been assembled. The stable RNA at 10^4 represents the input viral genomes. Intracellularly, the virus is replicating its genome and producing viral proteins, but complete particles have not yet been released. Eclipse period length varies by virus: picornaviruses (~4-6h), influenza (~6-8h), herpesviruses (~12-18h). (2) RNA accumulation before PFU appearance (6-8h): Between 6-8h, viral RNA increases 100-fold (10^4 \u2192 10^6) but no PFU are detected. This reflects the temporal program of viral gene expression: early gene expression produces replication machinery (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase), genome replication amplifies RNA copies, but structural protein synthesis and virion assembly lag behind RNA replication. RNA synthesis is faster than the complete assembly-and-release process. (3) Burst of infectious particles (8-10h): PFU suddenly appear at 10^5 when RNA reaches 10^8. This represents the first release of assembled, infectious virions. The particle-to-PFU ratio of 10^3 (10^8 RNA copies / 10^5 PFU) at 10h indicates that most RNA molecules at this point are either intracellular or in non-infectious particles, but the ratio is within the normal range for RNA viruses (10^1-10^4 for most RNA viruses). (4) Increasing particle-to-PFU ratio (10^3 \u2192 10^7): This dramatic 10,000-fold increase in the particle-to-PFU ratio is the most significant finding. While some degradation occurs (option B), a 4-log increase is far too large to explain by degradation alone. The primary explanation is the generation of defective interfering (DI) particles: DI particles contain deleted or rearranged viral genomes that retain the cis-acting signals for replication and packaging (origins of replication, packaging signals) but lack complete gene sets. They are produced by the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase through copy-choice recombination (template switching during replication). DI particles are 'replication-competent' in the presence of wild-type helper virus (which provides missing proteins in trans) but cannot produce progeny on their own. At high MOI (which occurs late in infection as virus accumulates), DI particles are preferentially amplified because their shorter genomes replicate faster. This creates an 'interference' cycle: DI particles accumulate \u2192 they compete with wild-type virus for replication machinery \u2192 infectious titer drops \u2192 fewer DI particles are produced \u2192 wild-type rebounds \u2192 cycle repeats. This self-regulating oscillation (von Magnus phenomenon) was first described for influenza virus passage. (5) PFU decline (14-24h): The decline from 10^6 to 10^4 PFU while RNA remains at 10^11 reflects: DI particle accumulation suppressing wild-type virus production, cell death reducing permissive cells, possible innate immune responses (IFN) in remaining cells, medium exhaustion. Option B (degradation alone) cannot explain a 4-log increase in ratio. Option C (contamination) is unlikely because RNA increases from baseline, showing active replication. Option D (lysogeny) is incorrect because RNA viruses (except retroviruses) do not establish lysogeny.",

        "Pseudotyping only occurs between closely related viruses of the same family, while phenotypic mixing can occur between any two viruses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phenotypic mixing and pseudotyping are important concepts in virology that demonstrate the distinction between genotype and phenotype: (1) Phenotypic mixing: When two different viruses co-infect the same cell, both genomes are replicated and both sets of proteins are produced. During virion assembly, surface proteins from both viruses can be incorporated into the same particle. Example: Co-infection with two influenza strains (H1N1 and H3N2) can produce virions with both H1 and H3 hemagglutinin on the same envelope. The genome inside is from only one parent. Result: The mixed particle has the combined host range/antigenicity of both parents, BUT this phenotype is not heritable \u2014 when the virion infects a new cell, the progeny will have surface proteins specified by its own genome only. (2) Pseudotyping: A more extreme form where the genome of one virus is completely packaged within the structural proteins (capsid or envelope) of a different virus. Example: VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) genome packaged in influenza envelope proteins. The pseudotyped virion has the tropism and entry properties of the donor virus (influenza, in this case) but once inside the cell, produces VSV progeny. Also not heritable. Practical applications of pseudotyping: Lentiviral vectors in gene therapy: HIV-based vectors are routinely pseudotyped with VSV-G glycoprotein to broaden tropism (VSV-G binds ubiquitous LDL receptor family members, giving nearly universal cell entry). Safety in BSL settings: Dangerous viruses (e.g., Ebola, Nipah) can be pseudotyped \u2014 the surface protein is studied using a non-pathogenic vector backbone (e.g., VSV-deltaG pseudotyped with Ebola GP), allowing BSL-2 work on BSL-4 virus entry. Pseudovirus neutralization assays: Used to study antibody responses without handling live pathogenic viruses (widely used for SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped onto HIV-based lentiviral particles). Key biological insight: Both phenomena demonstrate that viral surface proteins and genomes are independent modular components. The surface determines cell entry and tropism, while the genome determines all heritable properties. This modularity is exploited by nature (reassortment in segmented viruses, recombination) and by scientists (vector engineering). Option B is wrong \u2014 the phenotype is explicitly NOT heritable. Option C is wrong \u2014 pseudotyping can occur between very distantly related viruses (VSV + HIV is routinely done). Option D is wrong \u2014 neither phenomenon requires genetic recombination; they involve mixing of proteins and genomes during assembly, not genomic changes.",

      "question": "Evaluate the following statements about viral attenuation strategies used in vaccine development:\n\nS1: The Sabin oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains attenuated poliovirus strains with mutations in the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the 5' UTR that reduce translational efficiency specifically in neuronal cells, limiting neurovirulence while maintaining replication in intestinal epithelium.\nS2: The yellow fever 17D vaccine strain was derived by serial passage of the wild-type Asibi strain 176 times in mouse and chicken embryo tissue, accumulating approximately 68 nucleotide mutations across the genome \u2014 the attenuation results from multiple mutations acting synergistically, making reversion to virulence extremely unlikely.\nS3: Cold-adapted influenza vaccine strains (FluMist/LAIV) contain mutations in the polymerase genes that restrict viral replication to the cooler temperatures of the upper respiratory tract (25-33\u00b0C) while preventing replication at the warmer core body temperature (37-39\u00b0C) of the lower respiratory tract.\nS4: Codon-pair deoptimization is a modern attenuation strategy where synonymous codon pairs that are underrepresented in human genes are introduced throughout the viral genome, dramatically reducing translation efficiency and viral fitness without changing the amino acid sequence.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Analysis of viral attenuation strategies: S1 TRUE: The Sabin OPV strains (types 1, 2, and 3) contain critical attenuating mutations in the IRES (internal ribosome entry site) within the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR). Poliovirus uses an IRES for cap-independent translation initiation. The IRES has a complex secondary structure (domains II-VI) that recruits ribosomes. Key attenuating mutations: Sabin 1: G480A in domain V of the IRES. Sabin 2: G481A in domain V. Sabin 3: C472U in domain V (this is the primary attenuating mutation; it's also the most reversion-prone \u2014 reversion to U472C is the main cause of vaccine-derived poliovirus, VDPV). These IRES mutations reduce translational efficiency in neuronal cells specifically because neurons have a different complement of IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) compared to intestinal epithelial cells. In intestinal cells, the mutant IRES is still functional enough for productive replication (generating intestinal immunity). In neurons, the reduced translation efficiency prevents efficient viral replication, limiting neurovirulence. Additional attenuating mutations in other genome regions contribute to the overall attenuated phenotype. S2 TRUE: The yellow fever 17D vaccine is one of the most successful live attenuated vaccines ever developed. Max Theiler (Nobel Prize, 1951) attenuated the Asibi strain by serial passage: Asibi strain isolated from a patient named Asibi in Ghana (1927). Passaged 58 times in mouse brain tissue. Then passaged 128 times in chick embryo tissue (first in whole chick embryo, then in embryonic tissue without brain \u2014 to remove neurotropism). The 17D subculture (passage 227-235) was found to be safe and immunogenic. Approximately 68 nucleotide differences exist between wild-type Asibi and 17D (32 amino acid changes across the polyprotein). The attenuation is multigenic \u2014 mutations distributed across structural proteins (E protein mutations reduce viscerotropism) and non-structural proteins (NS genes affect replication efficiency). Because attenuation depends on many mutations acting together, the probability of simultaneous reversion of all attenuating mutations is essentially zero, making 17D one of the most genetically stable vaccine strains. Over 600 million doses administered, with an excellent safety record. S3 TRUE: Cold-adapted (ca) influenza vaccine strains for LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist) were developed by: Taking the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 master donor strains. Serially passaging them at progressively lower temperatures (from 37\u00b0C down to 25\u00b0C) over many passages. The ca strains acquired multiple mutations, primarily in the three polymerase genes (PB2, PB1, PA) and NP. Key phenotypic properties: Temperature-sensitive (ts): Cannot replicate efficiently at 37-39\u00b0C (core body/lower respiratory tract temperature). Cold-adapted (ca): Replicate efficiently at 25-33\u00b0C (upper respiratory tract temperature). Attenuated (att): Avirulent in animal models. The LAIV vaccine is produced by reassortment: the six internal gene segments (including the mutant polymerase genes) come from the ca master donor strain, while the two surface glycoprotein genes (HA and NA) come from the circulating strain. This restricts vaccine virus replication to the upper respiratory tract (33\u00b0C), generating mucosal IgA immunity without causing systemic illness. S4 TRUE: Codon pair deoptimization (also called synthetic attenuated virus engineering, SAVE) is a rational attenuation strategy developed by Wimmer, Mueller, and Coleman (~2008). Principle: While individual synonymous codons may be used at similar frequencies, certain codon PAIRS are statistically over- or under-represented in human/mammalian genomes (codon pair bias). Underrepresented codon pairs correlate with reduced translation efficiency (possibly due to tRNA competition, ribosome stalling, or mRNA structure). Method: Redesign the viral genome using synonymous mutations to introduce maximally underrepresented codon pairs throughout coding regions. The amino acid sequence is completely unchanged \u2014 every protein is identical to wild-type. But translation is dramatically less efficient, reducing viral fitness. Advantages: Hundreds to thousands of synonymous mutations are introduced, making reversion to virulence essentially impossible (each individual mutation provides minimal fitness gain). The vaccine strain produces identical proteins to wild-type (perfect antigenicity). Attenuation is tunable \u2014 more deoptimized codon pairs = more attenuation. Successfully applied to: poliovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2 in research settings. A codon-pair deoptimized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (COVI-VAC) entered clinical trials.",

      "question": "The lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophage lambda represent two alternative developmental pathways. What molecular switch determines whether lambda enters the lytic or lysogenic pathway upon infection?",
      "options": ["The decision depends on the competition between the CI repressor (promoting lysogeny by repressing lytic genes) and the Cro protein (promoting lysis by repressing CI); at low multiplicity of infection with a healthy host, Cro dominates and lysis occurs; at high MOI or stressed host conditions, CI accumulates sufficiently to establish lysogeny by binding to OR1 and OR2 operators, activating its own transcription and repressing lytic genes", "The decision is random and has no molecular basis", "Lambda always enters the lytic cycle first and lysogeny occurs only after failed lysis", "The host cell membrane composition determines the viral pathway"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The lambda phage lytic-lysogenic decision is one of the best-understood genetic switches in biology, pioneered by Mark Ptashne and colleagues: (1) Key players: CI repressor (lambda repressor): a 236-amino acid protein that forms dimers and binds to the operator regions OR and OL. CI maintains lysogeny by repressing lytic gene transcription and activating its own transcription from PRM (promoter for repressor maintenance). Cro protein: a small (66 aa) repressor that also binds OR and OL, but with opposite binding preferences to CI. Cro promotes the lytic pathway by repressing CI transcription from PRM. (2) The OR operator has three binding sites (OR1, OR2, OR3) between divergent promoters PR (rightward, lytic genes) and PRM (leftward, CI gene). CI binding preference: OR1 > OR2 > OR3. Cro binding preference: OR3 > OR2 > OR1. (3) Lysogenic pathway: When CI is produced (from the establishment promoter PRE, activated by CII protein): CI dimers bind OR1 first — this represses PR (blocking lytic gene transcription). CI at OR1 cooperatively recruits CI to OR2 — this both further represses PR AND activates PRM (positive autoregulation of CI). At normal CI levels, OR3 is NOT occupied, so PRM is active. This creates a stable lysogenic state maintained by CI positive autoregulation. (4) Lytic pathway: When Cro accumulates (from PR): Cro binds OR3 first — this represses PRM (blocking CI transcription). Without CI, PR and PL remain active, expressing all lytic functions. (5) Decision parameters: High multiplicity of infection (MOI): more CII protein accumulates, activating PRE, producing more CI → lysogeny. UV damage/SOS response: RecA-stimulated CI autocleavage (same mechanism as LexA) → lytic induction. Host cell health: starved or UV-damaged host activates SOS → lysis.",

      "question": "HIV-1 uses a complex replication strategy involving reverse transcriptase. What three enzymatic activities does HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possess, and why is the enzyme error-prone?",
      "options": ["HIV-1 RT has RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (synthesizing DNA from the RNA template), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (copying the first-strand cDNA into dsDNA), and RNase H activity (degrading the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids during reverse transcription); it lacks 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity, resulting in approximately one error per genome per replication cycle", "HIV-1 RT is a highly accurate enzyme with error rates lower than cellular DNA polymerases", "HIV-1 RT has only one enzymatic activity — RNA polymerization", "HIV-1 RT requires host cell DNA polymerase for all DNA synthesis steps"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits (p51 is derived from p66 by proteolytic processing) with three essential activities: (1) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP): The primary function — synthesizing a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand using the viral RNA genome as a template. This proceeds from a cellular tRNA primer (tRNALys3) that anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the viral RNA. (2) RNase H: Degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes. This is essential for: removing the RNA template after minus-strand DNA synthesis, generating the polypurine tract (PPT) primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis, and removing tRNA and PPT primers after they have served their function. (3) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP): Copies the minus-strand cDNA to generate the double-stranded proviral DNA. (4) Error rate: HIV-1 RT has an error rate of approximately 3.4 x 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle (about 1 mutation per 10 kb genome per cycle). This is ~10,000-fold higher than cellular DNA polymerases (which have proofreading exonuclease activity). The high error rate results from the absence of 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. (5) Consequences of error-prone replication: Rapid evolution: Within a single infected individual, HIV generates a cloud of variants (quasispecies) that enables immune escape, drug resistance, and tropism switching (CXCR4 vs. CCR5 coreceptor usage). Drug resistance: Mutations in RT (e.g., M184V for lamivudine resistance, K103N for nevirapine resistance) emerge rapidly under antiretroviral therapy, necessitating combination therapy (HAART). (6) RT as a drug target: Nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs: AZT, tenofovir, emtricitabine) are chain terminators lacking the 3'-OH for next nucleotide addition. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs: efavirenz, nevirapine) bind an allosteric pocket near the active site, distorting the enzyme.",

      "question": "Evaluate the following statements about viral genome types and replication strategies:\nS1: Baltimore Class IV viruses (positive-sense ssRNA, like poliovirus) can use their genomic RNA directly as mRNA for immediate translation upon entry into the host cell\nS2: Baltimore Class V viruses (negative-sense ssRNA, like influenza) must carry their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within the virion because the negative-sense genome cannot serve as mRNA\nS3: Retroviruses (Baltimore Class VI) integrate a DNA copy of their RNA genome into the host chromosome as a provirus, which is then transcribed by host RNA Pol II\nS4: All DNA viruses replicate exclusively in the nucleus of the host cell",
      "options": ["S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-True", "S1-False, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-True"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: Positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA) viruses have genomes that are equivalent in polarity to mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly bound by host ribosomes and translated. For poliovirus: the ~7.4 kb genome contains a single ORF translated into a large polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by viral proteases (2Apro, 3Cpro/3CDpro) into structural proteins (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (including the RdRp 3Dpol). The 5' UTR contains an IRES that mediates cap-independent translation. S2 TRUE: Negative-sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) viruses carry genomes that are complementary to mRNA and cannot be directly translated. The virion must package its own RdRp to transcribe the negative-sense genome into positive-sense mRNAs upon entry. For influenza: the three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) are packaged with each of the eight genomic RNA segments as ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The polymerase uses a unique cap-snatching mechanism: PB2 binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, and PA cleaves 10-13 nt downstream, using this capped fragment as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis. S3 TRUE: Retroviruses (HIV, HTLV, MLV) use reverse transcriptase to convert their +ssRNA genome into dsDNA. The viral integrase enzyme then catalyzes integration of this dsDNA (provirus) into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the provirus is permanent and is transcribed by host RNA Pol II from the 5' LTR promoter. S4 FALSE: While most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses), the Poxviridae (vaccinia, variola/smallpox) replicate entirely in the CYTOPLASM. Poxviruses are large enough to encode their own DNA replication machinery, transcription enzymes, and mRNA processing factors, making them independent of the nuclear machinery.",

      "question": "Researchers infect bacterial cells with two different T4 phage mutants: Mutant A carries a mutation in gene 23 (major capsid protein) and Mutant B carries a mutation in gene 34 (tail fiber protein). Neither mutant can produce plaques alone. When cells are co-infected with both mutants simultaneously, plaques appear at a frequency of 2%. What genetic phenomenon explains this result?",
      "options": ["Genetic recombination between the two phage genomes during co-infection generates wild-type recombinant phages with functional copies of both gene 23 and gene 34; the 2% plaque frequency reflects the recombination frequency between the two gene loci, indicating they are relatively far apart on the T4 genome", "The two mutant phages spontaneously reverted to wild-type simultaneously", "The host bacteria produced the missing proteins for both mutants", "The two phage genomes fused into a single larger genome containing both functional genes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This is a classic phage cross experiment demonstrating intergenic recombination: (1) Experimental logic: Mutant A is gene 23-minus, gene 34-plus (23- 34+). Mutant B is gene 23-plus, gene 34-minus (23+ 34-). Neither can complete the lytic cycle alone because each lacks one essential function. (2) Co-infection: When both mutants infect the same bacterial cell simultaneously, both genomes replicate. During replication, the linear phage DNA molecules undergo homologous recombination (T4 has its own recombination machinery including UvsX, analogous to RecA). (3) Recombination outcomes: Parental types: 23- 34+ and 23+ 34- (non-functional, no plaques). Recombinant type 1: 23+ 34+ (wild-type recombinant, produces plaques). Recombinant type 2: 23- 34- (double mutant, non-functional). (4) Recombination frequency: The 2% plaque frequency represents the frequency of wild-type recombinants (23+ 34+). By convention, the map distance between gene 23 and gene 34 is estimated as 2 x 2% = 4 map units (multiplied by 2 because both recombinant classes — wild-type and double mutant — are produced in equal frequency, but only wild-type forms plaques). (5) Historical significance: Phage crosses were used by Seymour Benzer to map the rII region of T4 at extraordinary resolution, demonstrating that genes are composed of linear sequences of nucleotides (sites of mutation) and establishing the concept of the cistron (functional unit of the gene, equivalent to what we now call a gene). Benzer's work provided the first evidence for the fine structure of the gene before DNA sequencing was possible.",

      "question": "Influenza A virus undergoes antigenic shift and antigenic drift. What distinguishes these two mechanisms of antigenic variation, and why is antigenic shift more dangerous?",
      "options": ["Antigenic drift involves gradual accumulation of point mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes through error-prone RNA replication; antigenic shift involves reassortment of entire genome segments between different influenza strains co-infecting the same cell, potentially generating a novel HA or NA subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity, causing pandemics", "Antigenic drift produces larger changes than antigenic shift", "Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza B, not influenza A", "Both mechanisms produce identical types of antigenic changes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Influenza A virus antigenic variation operates through two distinct mechanisms with vastly different epidemiological consequences: (1) Antigenic drift (gradual change): The influenza RdRp (PB1-PB2-PA complex) lacks proofreading activity, producing approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle. Mutations in the antigenic sites of HA (hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein targeted by neutralizing antibodies) and NA (neuraminidase) gradually alter the epitopes recognized by the immune system. Antigenic drift is responsible for seasonal flu epidemics — previous immunity provides partial but incomplete protection against drifted variants, requiring annual vaccine updates. (2) Antigenic shift (major change): Influenza A has a segmented genome (8 segments). When two different influenza A subtypes co-infect the same cell (e.g., in a pig, which can be infected by both avian and human strains), their genome segments can be randomly reassorted during virion assembly. This can generate a virus with an entirely new HA and/or NA subtype to which the human population has NO pre-existing immunity. (3) Why shift is more dangerous: Drift changes: antibodies from previous infections/vaccinations still partially cross-react (reduced but not absent protection). Annual epidemics with moderate morbidity/mortality. Shift changes: entirely new HA or NA subtype, NO cross-reactive antibodies in the population, potential for pandemic (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, 2009 H1N1pdm). (4) HA subtypes: 18 known HA subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1-N11). Only H1, H2, H3 and N1, N2 have caused sustained human-to-human transmission. (5) Mixing vessel hypothesis: Pigs can be co-infected with avian and human influenza strains, serving as a mixing vessel for reassortment. However, reassortment can also occur in humans, birds, or other hosts.",

      "question": "A researcher isolates a novel virus from diseased plants. To determine whether the virus has an RNA or DNA genome, she purifies the viral nucleic acid and treats separate aliquots with DNase I, RNase A, and both enzymes. The nucleic acid is completely degraded by RNase A alone but resistant to DNase I. Additionally, when the nucleic acid is denatured and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, it migrates as a single band. What can she conclude about the genome?",
      "options": ["The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome: sensitivity to RNase A confirms RNA (not DNA), resistance to DNase I confirms no DNA component, and migration as a single band after denaturation indicates a single-stranded (not double-stranded) molecule since dsRNA would separate into two complementary strands", "The virus has a double-stranded DNA genome", "The virus has a double-stranded RNA genome", "The virus has no nucleic acid and is a prion"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This systematic nuclease sensitivity analysis reveals the genome type: (1) RNase A sensitivity: RNase A (ribonuclease A) specifically cleaves single-stranded RNA at pyrimidine (C and U) residues. Complete degradation by RNase A demonstrates the genome is RNA. DNase I resistance confirms it is not DNA. This immediately classifies the virus as an RNA virus (Baltimore Class III, IV, or V). (2) Single-stranded determination: When a double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA or dsDNA) is denatured (heated or treated with formamide/NaOH), the two complementary strands separate and migrate as two bands on a denaturing gel (or as a band with different mobility than the native molecule). When a single-stranded nucleic acid is denatured, it simply loses secondary structure but remains as a single molecule, migrating as a single band. The observation of a single band after denaturation indicates ssRNA. (3) Classification: The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome. To determine sense (positive or negative), additional tests are needed: if the purified RNA is infectious when transfected into plant cells, it is positive-sense (can be directly translated); if not infectious alone, it is negative-sense (requires viral RdRp). Most plant RNA viruses are positive-sense ssRNA (e.g., Tobacco Mosaic Virus, Potato Virus X, Cucumber Mosaic Virus). (4) Additional characterization: RT-PCR and sequencing would reveal the complete genome sequence. Electron microscopy of purions would reveal virion morphology (rod-shaped for TMV-like, icosahedral for others). Protease treatment before nuclease treatment confirms the nucleic acid is within a protein coat (capsid protects genome in intact virions).",

      "question": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using a specific receptor. What is the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry?",
      "options": ["The viral Spike (S) protein trimer binds human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD); the S protein is then cleaved by host proteases TMPRSS2 (at the cell surface) or cathepsins (in endosomes) at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide that inserts into the host membrane and drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes", "SARS-CoV-2 enters through receptor-mediated endocytosis using the transferrin receptor", "The virus injects its genome through the cell membrane like a bacteriophage", "SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by directly fusing with the nuclear envelope"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SARS-CoV-2 entry is a multi-step process involving receptor binding and protease-dependent membrane fusion: (1) Spike protein structure: The S protein is a large (~1,273 aa) trimeric class I fusion protein on the viral envelope. Each monomer has two subunits: S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (membrane fusion). S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues ~319-541). The RBD exists in two conformations: 'down' (receptor-inaccessible, immune-evasive) and 'up' (receptor-accessible). (2) ACE2 binding: The RBD in the 'up' conformation binds human ACE2 with nanomolar affinity. ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease normally involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7). It is expressed on type II alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and other tissues. (3) S protein priming: The S protein must be proteolytically activated: S1/S2 cleavage: The furin cleavage site (RRAR, a polybasic insertion not found in closely related bat coronaviruses) at the S1/S2 boundary is cleaved during biosynthesis in the producer cell's Golgi. This primes the protein. S2' cleavage: At the target cell, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) cleaves at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide. Alternatively, in cells lacking TMPRSS2, the virus enters via endocytosis and cathepsin L cleaves S2' in the acidic endosome. (4) Membrane fusion: The exposed S2 fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The S2 heptad repeat regions (HR1, HR2) fold into a six-helix bundle (6-HB), pulling the viral and cell membranes together and driving membrane fusion, releasing the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. (5) Therapeutic targets: Monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD block ACE2 binding. TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat, nafamostat) block protease priming. Fusion inhibitors targeting the 6-HB formation are in development.",

      "question": "The Hershey-Chase experiment (1952) provided critical evidence that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material of bacteriophage T2. What was the key experimental design that allowed them to distinguish between DNA and protein?",
      "options": ["They differentially labeled phage DNA with radioactive 32P (phosphorus, present in DNA but not in protein) and phage protein with radioactive 35S (sulfur, present in protein but not in DNA); after infection and blender treatment to separate phage coats from bacteria, 32P was found inside the bacterial cells while 35S remained in the supernatant", "They used electron microscopy to directly visualize DNA entering the bacteria", "They treated phages with DNase and protease separately to see which destroyed infectivity", "They sequenced the phage genome and compared it to the protein sequences"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment exploited the chemical differences between DNA and protein: (1) Rationale: In 1952, the debate between DNA and protein as the genetic material was ongoing despite Avery-MacLeod-McCarty's 1944 transformation experiments. Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage T2 because its biology was well understood: the phage injects its genetic material into E. coli while the protein coat remains outside. (2) Labeling strategy: Phosphorus (P) is present in DNA (phosphodiester backbone) but absent from amino acids/proteins. Sulfur (S) is present in proteins (cysteine and methionine amino acids) but absent from DNA. They grew T2 phage in E. coli cultures containing either 32P (radioactive phosphorus, labeling DNA) or 35S (radioactive sulfur, labeling protein) in separate preparations. (3) Infection experiment: 32P-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → after infection, blender treatment (shearing force) separated empty phage coats ('ghosts') from infected bacteria → centrifugation pelleted bacteria (heavier) from phage coats (lighter supernatant). Result: 32P was found primarily in the bacterial pellet. 35S-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → same procedure. Result: 35S was found primarily in the supernatant (phage coats). (4) Interpretation: DNA (32P) enters the bacterial cell and directs phage reproduction, while protein (35S) remains outside. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material of phage T2. (5) Historical context: Combined with Avery's transformation experiment, Chargaff's rules, and Watson-Crick's structure (1953), this experiment helped establish the central role of DNA as the universal genetic material. Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize with Delbruck and Luria.",

      "question": "Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of protein. What is the molecular mechanism by which the prion protein PrPSc converts normal PrPC into the misfolded infectious form?",
      "options": ["PrPSc acts as a template that induces a conformational change in normal PrPC: the alpha-helix-rich PrPC refolds into the beta-sheet-rich PrPSc conformation through direct protein-protein interaction; PrPSc then recruits and converts additional PrPC molecules in an autocatalytic cascade, forming amyloid fibrils that are protease-resistant and accumulate as neurotoxic aggregates", "PrPSc contains a viral nucleic acid that directs the synthesis of more PrPSc", "PrPSc is an enzyme that chemically modifies PrPC through phosphorylation", "PrPSc causes mutations in the PRNP gene that change the amino acid sequence of PrPC"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The prion hypothesis, proposed by Stanley Prusiner (Nobel Prize 1997), describes a unique mechanism of infectious disease: (1) Normal PrPC: The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein (253 amino acids in humans) expressed on the surface of neurons and other cell types. PrPC has a predominantly alpha-helical structure (42% alpha-helix, 3% beta-sheet). Its normal function is debated but may involve copper binding, cell signaling, and synaptic function. (2) PrPSc (scrapie form): The misfolded, disease-associated form has the SAME amino acid sequence as PrPC but a dramatically different conformation: 43% beta-sheet, 30% alpha-helix. PrPSc is insoluble, resistant to proteinase K digestion (yielding a protease-resistant core called PrP27-30), and resistant to denaturation by heat, UV, formaldehyde, and most sterilization procedures. (3) Conversion mechanism: The protein-only model proposes that PrPSc physically contacts PrPC and acts as a template for conformational conversion. The monomer conversion model: one PrPSc molecule converts one PrPC molecule in a 1:1 interaction. More likely, the nucleated polymerization model: small PrPSc oligomers (seeds/nuclei) recruit PrPC monomers to their growing ends, converting them to PrPSc. When fibrils break (fragmentation), more seeds are created, exponentially amplifying the process. (4) Amyloid formation: PrPSc molecules stack into cross-beta amyloid fibrils — extended beta-sheets with beta-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis. These fibrils aggregate into amyloid plaques visible histologically as spongiform change (vacuolation of brain tissue). (5) Prion strains: Different prion strains cause different disease phenotypes (incubation period, brain region affected) despite having the same amino acid sequence. This is explained by different PrPSc conformations — each strain represents a distinct stable misfolded structure that faithfully self-replicates. (6) Diseases: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, fatal familial insomnia (humans), scrapie (sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/'mad cow'), chronic wasting disease (deer/elk).",

      "question": "Bacteriophage T4 has evolved multiple mechanisms to take over the host cell's biosynthetic machinery. How does T4 redirect host RNA polymerase to transcribe phage genes instead of bacterial genes?",
      "options": ["T4 modifies the host RNA polymerase through ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit (by Alt and Mod proteins injected with the phage DNA), degrades the host DNA (using nucleases to recycle nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis), and replaces the host sigma-70 factor with phage-encoded anti-sigma factors and new sigma-like proteins (e.g., MotA, AsiA) that redirect RNAP to phage promoters", "T4 carries its own complete RNA polymerase and never uses the host enzyme", "T4 DNA is automatically preferred by host RNA polymerase without any modifications", "T4 inhibits all transcription and relies entirely on pre-made host mRNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "T4 takeover of host gene expression is a multi-pronged strategy executed in temporal phases: (1) Immediate early (0-2 min): Proteins co-injected with the T4 DNA (Alt, internal protein I): Alt is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies Arg265 on one alpha subunit of host RNAP. This modification (occurring before any phage genes are transcribed) subtly alters RNAP promoter specificity to favor some T4 early promoters. MotA and AsiA proteins are expressed early: AsiA (Anti-Sigma 70 Inhibitor A) binds to region 4.2 of sigma-70, blocking its interaction with the -35 element of bacterial promoters. MotA (Modifier of Transcription A) binds to AsiA-modified sigma-70 and redirects RNAP to T4 middle-mode promoters that have a MotA-dependent element (MotA box) instead of a -35 sequence. (2) Host DNA degradation: T4 encodes several nucleases that degrade the host chromosome. T4 DNA is protected from its own nucleases by modification — T4 DNA contains hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) instead of cytosine, and HMC is further glucosylated by T4-encoded glucosyltransferases. This modified DNA is resistant to T4 restriction endonucleases that degrade unmodified (host) DNA. The degraded host DNA provides nucleotides for T4 DNA synthesis. (3) Alg (Anti-Late Gene silencing): At later times, the anti-sigma factor alters transcription patterns further. (4) Late gene transcription: T4 late genes are transcribed from late promoters that require the sigma factor-like protein gp33 and the co-activator gp55, along with the sliding clamp gp45 (T4 DNA polymerase processivity factor) loaded on T4 DNA. This couples late gene transcription to active T4 DNA replication — ensuring structural proteins are only made when DNA replication is well underway. (5) Net result: Within 5-10 minutes of infection, all host gene expression is shut down and the entire biosynthetic capacity of the cell is redirected to phage production.",

      "options": ["Integrase processes the 3' ends of the linear viral dsDNA by removing 2 dinucleotides (3' processing), then catalyzes a strand transfer reaction where the recessed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack phosphodiester bonds on opposite strands of target host DNA separated by 4-6 bp, creating a gapped intermediate that is repaired by host enzymes generating target site duplications (TSDs)", "Integrase uses homologous recombination to insert viral DNA at sites of sequence identity", "Viral DNA replaces an equivalent length of host DNA through a cut-and-paste mechanism", "Integration requires host topoisomerase II and occurs only at nuclear matrix attachment sites"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Retroviral integration is a well-characterized enzymatic process: (1) Integrase structure: A 32 kDa enzyme (288 aa in HIV-1) with three domains: N-terminal domain (HHCC zinc-binding motif), catalytic core domain (DDE catalytic triad: D64, D116, E152, which coordinate two Mg2+ ions essential for catalysis), and C-terminal domain (non-specific DNA binding). Integrase functions as a multimer (tetramer is the active form). (2) 3' processing: In the cytoplasm (within the preintegration complex, PIC), integrase recognizes the conserved att sequences at both ends of the viral DNA (CA dinucleotide at each 3' end) and removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end, exposing recessed 3'-OH groups (reactive hydroxyl groups). (3) Nuclear import: The PIC (viral DNA + integrase + other viral and host proteins including LEDGF/p75) is transported into the nucleus. LEDGF/p75 (Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor) is a host chromatin-associated protein that tethers integrase to active transcription units (targeting integration to gene bodies of actively transcribed genes). (4) Strand transfer: Integrase catalyzes a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction: the two exposed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack the phosphodiester backbone of the target DNA on opposite strands, staggered by 5 bp (for HIV-1). This inserts the viral DNA into the host chromosome with 5 bp single-stranded gaps at each junction and 2-nt 5' overhangs of viral DNA that must be removed. (5) Gap repair: Host DNA repair enzymes (likely base excision repair and possibly NHEJ/HR pathways) remove the 2-nt overhangs, fill in the 5 bp gaps, and ligate the junctions. This generates the characteristic 5 bp target site duplications (TSDs) flanking the integrated provirus — a hallmark of retroviral integration. (6) Drug target: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs: raltegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, cabotegravir) are potent antiretroviral drugs that block the strand transfer step by chelating the catalytic Mg2+ ions.",

After infection at time 0, they observe an initial eclipse period (0-12 min) during which no intracellular phage particles are detectable, followed by a latent period (0-25 min) during which no extracellular phage are released. At 25 minutes, cell lysis begins and phage titer increases rapidly, plateauing at ~200 phage per original infected cell (burst size = 200). What do the eclipse and latent periods represent?",
      "options": ["The eclipse period is the time required for phage components (DNA, proteins) to be synthesized before any complete virions are assembled; the latent period extends from infection to the first cell lysis event, during which complete intracellular phage accumulate after the eclipse ends but are not yet released because the cell membrane is still intact", "The eclipse period represents the time for phage DNA to replicate while proteins are already made", "The latent period is caused by a delay in phage adsorption to the host cell", "Both periods represent inactive phage that have lost infectivity temporarily"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The one-step growth curve, developed by Emory Ellis and Max Delbruck (1939), reveals the intracellular phage replication timeline: (1) Experimental setup: Bacteria are infected at high MOI (to synchronize infection). Unadsorbed phage are removed. At time intervals, samples are taken and: (a) plated directly (measures extracellular free phage), or (b) treated with chloroform (lyses cells, measures total phage = intracellular + extracellular). (2) Eclipse period (0-12 min in this example): During this period, no complete phage particles exist anywhere — not extracellular (no lysis yet) and not intracellular (components haven't been assembled yet). The phage genome has entered the cell and is being replicated and transcribed, mRNA is being translated into phage proteins, but individual components (capsid proteins, tail fibers, baseplate, DNA) have not yet been assembled into complete infectious virions. Chloroform lysis at this time releases only disassembled components — no plaques form. This period was first described by Anderson and Doermann (1952). (3) Post-eclipse, pre-lysis (12-25 min): After the eclipse ends, intracellular assembly begins. Complete phage particles accumulate inside the cell. If cells are lysed artificially (chloroform), increasing numbers of phage are detected. However, no phage are detected externally because the cell has not yet lysed naturally. (4) Latent period (0-25 min): The total time from infection to the first release of phage by natural cell lysis. It includes the eclipse period plus the maturation period. (5) Rise period (25-~35 min): Cells lyse (triggered by phage-encoded holins and lysozyme/endolysin), releasing assembled phage. The titer increases from 1 to ~200 phage per cell. (6) Burst size = 200: Each infected cell produces approximately 200 progeny phage. This number varies by phage type (T4: ~200, T7: ~100, lambda: ~100).",

      "question": "Ebola virus (a filovirus) has a negative-sense RNA genome. How does Ebola's VP35 protein help the virus evade the host innate immune response?",
      "options": ["VP35 is a double-stranded RNA binding protein that sequesters viral dsRNA replication intermediates, preventing their detection by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5; VP35 also directly inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and blocks IFN-beta production, effectively suppressing the type I interferon antiviral response", "VP35 stimulates the interferon response to help clear the infection faster", "VP35 is a structural protein that forms the viral envelope and has no immune evasion function", "VP35 degrades all host mRNAs to prevent interferon production"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ebola VP35 is a multifunctional virulence factor that is critical for immune evasion: (1) dsRNA binding: During Ebola replication, the viral RdRp (L protein) generates dsRNA intermediates (replication intermediates and potentially dsRNA ends of panhandle structures). These dsRNA molecules are normally sensed by cytoplasmic innate immune sensors: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I) recognizes short dsRNA with 5'-triphosphate ends, and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) recognizes long dsRNA. VP35 contains a dsRNA-binding domain (IID domain, residues 220-340) that binds and sequesters dsRNA, physically preventing recognition by RIG-I and MDA5. Crystal structures show VP35 caps the dsRNA ends, hiding the 5'-triphosphate from RIG-I. (2) Inhibition of RIG-I signaling: VP35 also directly interacts with PACT (Protein Activator of PKR), which normally activates RIG-I signaling. By binding PACT, VP35 prevents PACT-mediated RIG-I activation. (3) Inhibition of IRF3: VP35 inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3) by the kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. Without IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 cannot dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, or activate the IFN-beta promoter. This blocks the primary transcriptional induction of type I interferons. (4) Inhibition of IRF7: VP35 also inhibits IRF7 activation, blocking the amplification loop of interferon production. (5) Consequence: By simultaneously suppressing dsRNA sensing and IFN signaling at multiple points, VP35 creates an environment of unchecked viral replication. The absence of IFN-mediated antiviral defenses allows explosive viral replication in macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. This contributes to the severe pathology of Ebola virus disease (hemorrhagic fever, multi-organ failure, up to 90% fatality rate for some outbreaks). (6) VP24 cooperation: Another Ebola protein, VP24, inhibits IFN signaling downstream by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (binding karyopherin alpha1). Together, VP35 and VP24 create a comprehensive block of innate immunity.",

      "options": ["A quasispecies is a cloud of genetically diverse but related viral variants generated by error-prone RNA replication, centered around a master sequence; this diversity provides a reservoir of pre-existing variants including drug-resistant mutants, meaning that monotherapy with a single antiviral drug rapidly selects for resistance, necessitating combination therapy targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously", "A quasispecies is a single viral genotype that remains unchanged during infection", "Quasispecies theory applies only to DNA viruses with high-fidelity replication", "A quasispecies consists of completely unrelated viruses co-infecting the same host"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viral quasispecies theory, developed by Manfred Eigen and applied to virology by Esteban Domingo, describes the population genetics of rapidly mutating RNA viruses: (1) Error-prone replication: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and reverse transcriptases lack proofreading exonuclease activity. Error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle mean that for a 10 kb genome, essentially every newly synthesized genome contains at least one mutation. (2) Quasispecies structure: The viral population is not a single genotype but a dynamic distribution (cloud) of closely related variants. The distribution is centered on a master sequence (the most fit genotype in the current environment) but contains a vast number of minority variants at lower frequencies. (3) Selection unit: In quasispecies theory, natural selection acts on the entire mutant distribution, not just individual genotypes. The master sequence may not even be the most abundant genotype — the consensus sequence (derived from the most common nucleotide at each position) represents the population average. (4) Implications for antiviral therapy: (a) Pre-existing resistance: Due to the enormous population sizes (10^8-10^12 virions per patient for HIV, HCV) and high mutation rates, drug-resistant variants pre-exist at low frequency BEFORE drug treatment begins. For HIV, any single point mutation conferring drug resistance exists in the quasispecies at ~10^4-10^5 copies. (b) Rapid resistance emergence: Under monotherapy, resistant variants are rapidly selected, becoming the dominant population within days to weeks. (c) Combination therapy: Targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously (HAART for HIV: 2 NRTIs + integrase inhibitor; Harvoni for HCV: sofosbuvir + ledipasvir) requires multiple simultaneous resistance mutations to emerge, which is probabilistically extremely unlikely (~10^-10 x 10^-10 = 10^-20 for two independent mutations). (5) Error catastrophe: If the mutation rate exceeds a threshold (error threshold), the quasispecies cannot maintain genetic information and collapses. Mutagenic drugs (ribavirin, favipiravir, molnupiravir) exploit this principle by increasing the mutation rate above the error threshold — a strategy called lethal mutagenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The spot assay is the standard rapid method for determining phage host range: (1) Method: Each bacterial strain is grown to log phase in liquid culture. A thin layer of soft agar containing each strain is poured as a lawn on individual plates (or sectors of a single plate). Small volumes (5-10 uL) of serial dilutions of the phage lysate are spotted onto each lawn. Plates are incubated overnight. (2) Interpretation: Clear zone (zone of lysis): The phage can infect and lyse this bacterial strain. The zone may show individual plaques at low phage concentration or confluent lysis at high concentration. No clearing: The strain is resistant. Resistance can be due to: lack of the phage receptor on the bacterial surface, restriction-modification systems that degrade injected phage DNA, CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity targeting the phage, superinfection immunity (if the strain is a lysogen of a related phage), or abortive infection systems. Turbid clearing: The phage may be temperate (capable of lysogeny), producing turbid plaques due to immune lysogens growing within the plaque. (3) Efficiency of plating (EOP): For quantitative host range analysis, plaque counts on each susceptible strain are compared to the reference host. EOP = (plaques on test strain) / (plaques on reference host). EOP of 1.0 = equally efficient, <0.1 = restricted, >1.0 = the test strain is more permissive.

      "question": "HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to cure. What maintains the latent provirus in a transcriptionally silent state?",
      "options": ["In resting CD4+ T cells, the integrated HIV provirus is silenced by multiple epigenetic mechanisms: the 5' LTR promoter is associated with repressive chromatin (hypoacetylated histones, positioned nucleosome nuc-1 over the TSS), lacks active host transcription factors (NF-kB and NFAT are sequestered in the cytoplasm), and the absence of P-TEFb prevents Tat-mediated transcriptional elongation", "Latent HIV proviruses are deleted from the host genome and must re-integrate upon reactivation", "HIV latency is maintained solely by the absence of the viral Rev protein", "Latent proviruses continuously produce low levels of virus that are immediately neutralized by antibodies"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 latency is maintained by multiple reinforcing mechanisms at the transcriptional level: (1) Chromatin-based repression: The integrated provirus at the 5' LTR promoter has two positioned nucleosomes: nuc-0 (upstream) and nuc-1 (positioned directly over the transcription start site). In latency, nuc-1 is hypoacetylated and carries repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3) are recruited to the LTR by host transcription factors YY1, LSF, and CBF-1 (the Notch pathway effector that recruits the corepressor complex). (2) Transcription factor absence: In resting CD4+ T cells: NF-kB (p65/p50): sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkBα. The HIV LTR contains two NF-kB binding sites essential for efficient transcription. NFAT: also cytoplasmic, requires calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for nuclear entry. AP-1: not active in resting cells. Without these inducible transcription factors, basal LTR transcription is extremely low. (3) P-TEFb sequestration: In resting T cells, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T1) is sequestered in an inactive complex with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. Without active P-TEFb, even if RNA Pol II initiates at the LTR, it pauses at the TAR (transactivation response) element and cannot transition to productive elongation. The viral Tat protein normally recruits P-TEFb to TAR, but Tat levels are zero or minimal in latently infected cells (a chicken-and-egg problem). (4) DNA methylation: CpG dinucleotides in the LTR can become methylated, contributing to long-term silencing. (5) Latency reversal: T cell activation (antigen stimulation, PMA/ionomycin) activates NF-kB, NFAT, and P-TEFb, reactivating the provirus. 'Shock and kill' strategies use latency-reversing agents (LRAs) like HDAC inhibitors (SAHA, romidepsin), PKC agonists (bryostatin, prostratin), or BET inhibitors to reactivate latent proviruses, exposing them to immune clearance or antiretroviral drugs.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: HSV-1 ICP47 (Infected Cell Protein 47) is a small (88 aa) immediate-early protein that binds the TAP transporter (TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer) in the ER membrane. TAP normally translocates proteasome-generated peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. ICP47 blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP from the cytoplasmic side, preventing peptide translocation. Without peptide loading, MHC class I molecules are retained in the ER (empty/peptide-receptive MHC I is unstable) and do not reach the cell surface. This renders HSV-infected cells invisible to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. S2 TRUE: Adenovirus E1A binds p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein), which are essential coactivators for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. By sequestering p300/CBP, E1A reduces histone acetylation at ISG promoters and blocks the ISGF3 (STAT1-STAT2-IRF9) complex from activating ISGs. E1A also blocks STAT1 signaling. S3 TRUE: Vaccinia virus (and other poxviruses) encode multiple secreted proteins that mimic host cytokine receptors. These viroceptors act as molecular sponges: viral TNF receptor homologs (CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, CrmE) bind and neutralize TNF-alpha, preventing its pro-inflammatory signaling. Viral IL-1 receptor homolog (B15R) binds IL-1beta. Viral IFN-alpha/beta receptor homolog (B18R/B19R) binds and neutralizes type I interferons. This is possible because poxviruses have large genomes (130-375 kb) capable of encoding many immune evasion proteins. S4 FALSE: Influenza NS1 (Non-Structural protein 1) is a potent innate immune antagonist with multiple functions: binds dsRNA (preventing RIG-I activation), inhibits the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 (required for RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination and signaling), blocks CPSF30 (inhibiting 3' processing of host mRNAs including IFN mRNA), and inhibits PKR activation.

      "options": ["TMV has a rigid helical rod structure (~300 nm x 18 nm) composed of ~2,130 identical coat protein (CP) subunits arranged in a helix around a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome; assembly initiates when a 20S aggregate (two-turn disk) of CP recognizes a specific origin of assembly sequence (OAS) in the RNA, and elongation proceeds bidirectionally as additional CP subunits add in a 5'-to-3' and 3'-to-5' direction", "TMV has an icosahedral capsid with 60 identical subunits", "TMV assembly requires host chaperone proteins and ATP hydrolysis", "TMV has a lipid envelope surrounding a helical nucleocapsid"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TMV is the paradigm for understanding helical virus assembly: (1) Structure: TMV is a non-enveloped, rigid rod 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, with a 4 nm central channel. The capsid consists of approximately 2,130 copies of a single 17.5 kDa coat protein (CP) subunit arranged in a right-handed helix with 16.3 subunits per turn and a pitch of 2.3 nm. The ssRNA genome (6,395 nt) is embedded between protein subunits in a helical groove, with 3 nucleotides per CP subunit. (2) Assembly initiation: CP subunits self-associate into various aggregates depending on pH and ionic conditions. At neutral pH, the predominant form is the 20S aggregate — a two-layer disk of 34 subunits. The 20S disk recognizes and binds the Origin of Assembly Sequence (OAS, also called the packaging signal), a specific hairpin loop structure located approximately 900 nt from the 3' end of the RNA (within the gene encoding the movement protein). The RNA threads through the central hole of the disk and inserts between the two layers, which then convert (jaws mechanism) from a flat disk to a short helix (the lock-washer form). (3) Elongation: Additional CP subunits (as disks or smaller aggregates) add to the growing helix. Elongation in the 5' direction is rapid because the RNA loop is pulled through the central channel, progressively incorporating more RNA. Elongation in the 3' direction is slower and may involve addition of individual CP monomers. (4) Thermodynamic principles: CP-CP and CP-RNA interactions are both important. RNA is NOT required for helix formation (CP alone forms helical rods in vitro at low pH), but RNA dramatically accelerates and nucleates assembly under physiological conditions. The OAS ensures that TMV RNA is preferentially packaged over host RNAs. (5) Historical significance: Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat (1955) demonstrated that purified TMV RNA alone was infectious (confirming RNA as the genetic material of TMV), and reconstitution of infectious virions from purified RNA and CP subunits showed that self-assembly requires no host machinery.",

      "options": ["During adaptation, the Cas1-Cas2 complex captures short protospacer sequences from the invading phage DNA and integrates them as new spacers into the CRISPR array; during interference, the CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into crRNAs that pair with tracrRNA and guide the Cas9 endonuclease to complementary sequences in the phage genome, where Cas9 generates a double-strand break adjacent to a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence", "CRISPR-Cas9 recognizes phage proteins rather than nucleic acids", "The CRISPR array is pre-programmed at birth and cannot incorporate new sequences", "Cas9 functions as an RNA polymerase that produces antiviral RNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system operates in three stages: (1) Adaptation (spacer acquisition): When a new phage infects the cell, the Cas1-Cas2 complex (Cas1 is an integrase, Cas2 is a structural scaffold) selects a ~30 bp segment (protospacer) from the phage DNA. Protospacer selection requires the presence of a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif, typically 5'-NGG-3' for S. pyogenes Cas9) flanking the protospacer. The selected protospacer is integrated at the leader end (5' end) of the CRISPR array, between the leader sequence and the first existing repeat. The repeat is duplicated in the process, creating: leader-new spacer-repeat-old spacer-repeat. This creates a chronological record of past infections. (2) Expression (crRNA biogenesis): The entire CRISPR array is transcribed as a single long pre-crRNA. A trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), encoded elsewhere in the CRISPR locus, has a region complementary to the repeat sequences and base-pairs with pre-crRNA. RNase III (host enzyme) processes the pre-crRNA:tracrRNA duplex into individual crRNA:tracrRNA units. Each mature crRNA:tracrRNA guide contains: the spacer sequence (20 nt complementary to the phage target) and the tracrRNA (which interacts with Cas9). (3) Interference (target cleavage): The Cas9 protein binds the crRNA:tracrRNA guide. Cas9 scans incoming DNA for PAM sequences (PAM recognition is the first step and occurs through protein-DNA contacts, not base-pairing). Upon finding a PAM, Cas9 locally unwinds the DNA and tests for complementarity with the crRNA spacer through Watson-Crick base-pairing (R-loop formation). If complementarity extends through the seed region (10-12 nt proximal to PAM), Cas9 undergoes a conformational change activating both nuclease domains: RuvC cleaves the non-target strand, HNH cleaves the target strand, creating a blunt-ended DSB 3 bp upstream of the PAM. (4) Self vs. non-self: The PAM sequence prevents self-targeting: the spacer in the CRISPR array lacks the PAM (the PAM is only present in the phage DNA flanking the protospacer). If the PAM is mutated or absent, Cas9 cannot bind and cleave. (5) Phage counter-defense: Phages evolve anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems by blocking DNA binding, preventing Cas protein loading, or degrading crRNAs.",

      "options": ["Viroids replicate entirely using host enzymes: nuclear viroids (like PSTVd) hijack host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II to synthesize complementary RNA from the viroid RNA template through rolling circle replication, producing multimeric linear intermediates that are cleaved by either host RNase or the viroid's own hammerhead ribozyme (in chloroplastic viroids) and ligated into circular monomers", "Viroids encode a small RNA polymerase within their circular RNA structure", "Viroids replicate through reverse transcription and integration like retroviruses", "Viroids do not replicate and are transmitted only as pre-formed molecules from parent to offspring"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viroids are remarkable in their ability to replicate using solely host machinery: (1) Structure: Viroids are small (246-401 nt) circular ssRNA molecules with extensive intramolecular base-pairing forming a rod-like or branched secondary structure. They contain NO open reading frames and encode NO proteins. (2) Two families: Pospiviroidae (nuclear viroids, type species: Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid, PSTVd): replicate in the nucleus. Avsunviroidae (chloroplastic viroids, type species: Avocado Sunblotch Viroid, ASBVd): replicate in chloroplasts. (3) Nuclear viroid replication (asymmetric rolling circle): The plus-strand circular viroid RNA enters the nucleus. Host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II (normally transcribes DNA → mRNA) is redirected to use the viroid RNA as template (an aberrant template usage). Pol II initiates at a specific site and continuously copies the circular template (rolling circle mechanism), producing long concatemeric minus-strand RNA. The minus-strand concatemer serves as template for another round of Pol II transcription, producing concatemeric plus-strand RNA. The concatemers are cleaved into unit-length monomers by an unknown host RNase (likely RNase III-like activity recognizing specific structural elements). Monomeric linear RNAs are circularized by host tRNA ligase. (4) Chloroplastic viroid replication (symmetric rolling circle): Both plus and minus strands serve as templates (using a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, NEP). Both plus and minus concatemers are self-cleaved by embedded hammerhead ribozyme motifs — catalytic RNAs that self-cleave through a transesterification reaction requiring a specific tertiary structure and divalent metal ion. Monomers are ligated by host chloroplastic tRNA ligase. (5) Pathogenesis: Viroids cause disease through RNA silencing: viroid RNA is processed by host Dicer into viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) that enter the RISC complex and silence host genes with complementary sequences, causing developmental abnormalities. (6) Significance: Viroids may represent relics of the RNA World — self-replicating RNA molecules that predate the evolution of proteins.",

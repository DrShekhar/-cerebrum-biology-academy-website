      "question": "The lytic and lysogenic cycles of bacteriophage lambda represent two alternative developmental pathways. What molecular switch determines whether lambda enters the lytic or lysogenic pathway upon infection?",
      "options": ["The decision depends on the competition between the CI repressor (promoting lysogeny by repressing lytic genes) and the Cro protein (promoting lysis by repressing CI); at low multiplicity of infection with a healthy host, Cro dominates and lysis occurs; at high MOI or stressed host conditions, CI accumulates sufficiently to establish lysogeny by binding to OR1 and OR2 operators, activating its own transcription and repressing lytic genes", "The decision is random and has no molecular basis", "Lambda always enters the lytic cycle first and lysogeny occurs only after failed lysis", "The host cell membrane composition determines the viral pathway"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The lambda phage lytic-lysogenic decision is one of the best-understood genetic switches in biology, pioneered by Mark Ptashne and colleagues: (1) Key players: CI repressor (lambda repressor): a 236-amino acid protein that forms dimers and binds to the operator regions OR and OL. CI maintains lysogeny by repressing lytic gene transcription and activating its own transcription from PRM (promoter for repressor maintenance). Cro protein: a small (66 aa) repressor that also binds OR and OL, but with opposite binding preferences to CI. Cro promotes the lytic pathway by repressing CI transcription from PRM. (2) The OR operator has three binding sites (OR1, OR2, OR3) between divergent promoters PR (rightward, lytic genes) and PRM (leftward, CI gene). CI binding preference: OR1 > OR2 > OR3. Cro binding preference: OR3 > OR2 > OR1. (3) Lysogenic pathway: When CI is produced (from the establishment promoter PRE, activated by CII protein): CI dimers bind OR1 first — this represses PR (blocking lytic gene transcription). CI at OR1 cooperatively recruits CI to OR2 — this both further represses PR AND activates PRM (positive autoregulation of CI). At normal CI levels, OR3 is NOT occupied, so PRM is active. This creates a stable lysogenic state maintained by CI positive autoregulation. (4) Lytic pathway: When Cro accumulates (from PR): Cro binds OR3 first — this represses PRM (blocking CI transcription). Without CI, PR and PL remain active, expressing all lytic functions. (5) Decision parameters: High multiplicity of infection (MOI): more CII protein accumulates, activating PRE, producing more CI → lysogeny. UV damage/SOS response: RecA-stimulated CI autocleavage (same mechanism as LexA) → lytic induction. Host cell health: starved or UV-damaged host activates SOS → lysis.",

      "question": "HIV-1 uses a complex replication strategy involving reverse transcriptase. What three enzymatic activities does HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possess, and why is the enzyme error-prone?",
      "options": ["HIV-1 RT has RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (synthesizing DNA from the RNA template), DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (copying the first-strand cDNA into dsDNA), and RNase H activity (degrading the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids during reverse transcription); it lacks 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity, resulting in approximately one error per genome per replication cycle", "HIV-1 RT is a highly accurate enzyme with error rates lower than cellular DNA polymerases", "HIV-1 RT has only one enzymatic activity — RNA polymerization", "HIV-1 RT requires host cell DNA polymerase for all DNA synthesis steps"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits (p51 is derived from p66 by proteolytic processing) with three essential activities: (1) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP): The primary function — synthesizing a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand using the viral RNA genome as a template. This proceeds from a cellular tRNA primer (tRNALys3) that anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the viral RNA. (2) RNase H: Degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes. This is essential for: removing the RNA template after minus-strand DNA synthesis, generating the polypurine tract (PPT) primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis, and removing tRNA and PPT primers after they have served their function. (3) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DDDP): Copies the minus-strand cDNA to generate the double-stranded proviral DNA. (4) Error rate: HIV-1 RT has an error rate of approximately 3.4 x 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle (about 1 mutation per 10 kb genome per cycle). This is ~10,000-fold higher than cellular DNA polymerases (which have proofreading exonuclease activity). The high error rate results from the absence of 3'-to-5' exonuclease proofreading activity. (5) Consequences of error-prone replication: Rapid evolution: Within a single infected individual, HIV generates a cloud of variants (quasispecies) that enables immune escape, drug resistance, and tropism switching (CXCR4 vs. CCR5 coreceptor usage). Drug resistance: Mutations in RT (e.g., M184V for lamivudine resistance, K103N for nevirapine resistance) emerge rapidly under antiretroviral therapy, necessitating combination therapy (HAART). (6) RT as a drug target: Nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs: AZT, tenofovir, emtricitabine) are chain terminators lacking the 3'-OH for next nucleotide addition. Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs: efavirenz, nevirapine) bind an allosteric pocket near the active site, distorting the enzyme.",

      "question": "Evaluate the following statements about viral genome types and replication strategies:\nS1: Baltimore Class IV viruses (positive-sense ssRNA, like poliovirus) can use their genomic RNA directly as mRNA for immediate translation upon entry into the host cell\nS2: Baltimore Class V viruses (negative-sense ssRNA, like influenza) must carry their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within the virion because the negative-sense genome cannot serve as mRNA\nS3: Retroviruses (Baltimore Class VI) integrate a DNA copy of their RNA genome into the host chromosome as a provirus, which is then transcribed by host RNA Pol II\nS4: All DNA viruses replicate exclusively in the nucleus of the host cell",
      "options": ["S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-True", "S1-False, S2-True, S3-True, S4-False", "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-True"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: Positive-sense ssRNA (+ssRNA) viruses have genomes that are equivalent in polarity to mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly bound by host ribosomes and translated. For poliovirus: the ~7.4 kb genome contains a single ORF translated into a large polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by viral proteases (2Apro, 3Cpro/3CDpro) into structural proteins (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (including the RdRp 3Dpol). The 5' UTR contains an IRES that mediates cap-independent translation. S2 TRUE: Negative-sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) viruses carry genomes that are complementary to mRNA and cannot be directly translated. The virion must package its own RdRp to transcribe the negative-sense genome into positive-sense mRNAs upon entry. For influenza: the three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, PA) are packaged with each of the eight genomic RNA segments as ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The polymerase uses a unique cap-snatching mechanism: PB2 binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, and PA cleaves 10-13 nt downstream, using this capped fragment as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis. S3 TRUE: Retroviruses (HIV, HTLV, MLV) use reverse transcriptase to convert their +ssRNA genome into dsDNA. The viral integrase enzyme then catalyzes integration of this dsDNA (provirus) into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the provirus is permanent and is transcribed by host RNA Pol II from the 5' LTR promoter. S4 FALSE: While most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses), the Poxviridae (vaccinia, variola/smallpox) replicate entirely in the CYTOPLASM. Poxviruses are large enough to encode their own DNA replication machinery, transcription enzymes, and mRNA processing factors, making them independent of the nuclear machinery.",

      "question": "Researchers infect bacterial cells with two different T4 phage mutants: Mutant A carries a mutation in gene 23 (major capsid protein) and Mutant B carries a mutation in gene 34 (tail fiber protein). Neither mutant can produce plaques alone. When cells are co-infected with both mutants simultaneously, plaques appear at a frequency of 2%. What genetic phenomenon explains this result?",
      "options": ["Genetic recombination between the two phage genomes during co-infection generates wild-type recombinant phages with functional copies of both gene 23 and gene 34; the 2% plaque frequency reflects the recombination frequency between the two gene loci, indicating they are relatively far apart on the T4 genome", "The two mutant phages spontaneously reverted to wild-type simultaneously", "The host bacteria produced the missing proteins for both mutants", "The two phage genomes fused into a single larger genome containing both functional genes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This is a classic phage cross experiment demonstrating intergenic recombination: (1) Experimental logic: Mutant A is gene 23-minus, gene 34-plus (23- 34+). Mutant B is gene 23-plus, gene 34-minus (23+ 34-). Neither can complete the lytic cycle alone because each lacks one essential function. (2) Co-infection: When both mutants infect the same bacterial cell simultaneously, both genomes replicate. During replication, the linear phage DNA molecules undergo homologous recombination (T4 has its own recombination machinery including UvsX, analogous to RecA). (3) Recombination outcomes: Parental types: 23- 34+ and 23+ 34- (non-functional, no plaques). Recombinant type 1: 23+ 34+ (wild-type recombinant, produces plaques). Recombinant type 2: 23- 34- (double mutant, non-functional). (4) Recombination frequency: The 2% plaque frequency represents the frequency of wild-type recombinants (23+ 34+). By convention, the map distance between gene 23 and gene 34 is estimated as 2 x 2% = 4 map units (multiplied by 2 because both recombinant classes — wild-type and double mutant — are produced in equal frequency, but only wild-type forms plaques). (5) Historical significance: Phage crosses were used by Seymour Benzer to map the rII region of T4 at extraordinary resolution, demonstrating that genes are composed of linear sequences of nucleotides (sites of mutation) and establishing the concept of the cistron (functional unit of the gene, equivalent to what we now call a gene). Benzer's work provided the first evidence for the fine structure of the gene before DNA sequencing was possible.",

      "question": "Influenza A virus undergoes antigenic shift and antigenic drift. What distinguishes these two mechanisms of antigenic variation, and why is antigenic shift more dangerous?",
      "options": ["Antigenic drift involves gradual accumulation of point mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes through error-prone RNA replication; antigenic shift involves reassortment of entire genome segments between different influenza strains co-infecting the same cell, potentially generating a novel HA or NA subtype to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity, causing pandemics", "Antigenic drift produces larger changes than antigenic shift", "Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza B, not influenza A", "Both mechanisms produce identical types of antigenic changes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Influenza A virus antigenic variation operates through two distinct mechanisms with vastly different epidemiological consequences: (1) Antigenic drift (gradual change): The influenza RdRp (PB1-PB2-PA complex) lacks proofreading activity, producing approximately one mutation per genome per replication cycle. Mutations in the antigenic sites of HA (hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein targeted by neutralizing antibodies) and NA (neuraminidase) gradually alter the epitopes recognized by the immune system. Antigenic drift is responsible for seasonal flu epidemics — previous immunity provides partial but incomplete protection against drifted variants, requiring annual vaccine updates. (2) Antigenic shift (major change): Influenza A has a segmented genome (8 segments). When two different influenza A subtypes co-infect the same cell (e.g., in a pig, which can be infected by both avian and human strains), their genome segments can be randomly reassorted during virion assembly. This can generate a virus with an entirely new HA and/or NA subtype to which the human population has NO pre-existing immunity. (3) Why shift is more dangerous: Drift changes: antibodies from previous infections/vaccinations still partially cross-react (reduced but not absent protection). Annual epidemics with moderate morbidity/mortality. Shift changes: entirely new HA or NA subtype, NO cross-reactive antibodies in the population, potential for pandemic (1918 H1N1, 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, 2009 H1N1pdm). (4) HA subtypes: 18 known HA subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1-N11). Only H1, H2, H3 and N1, N2 have caused sustained human-to-human transmission. (5) Mixing vessel hypothesis: Pigs can be co-infected with avian and human influenza strains, serving as a mixing vessel for reassortment. However, reassortment can also occur in humans, birds, or other hosts.",

      "question": "A researcher isolates a novel virus from diseased plants. To determine whether the virus has an RNA or DNA genome, she purifies the viral nucleic acid and treats separate aliquots with DNase I, RNase A, and both enzymes. The nucleic acid is completely degraded by RNase A alone but resistant to DNase I. Additionally, when the nucleic acid is denatured and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, it migrates as a single band. What can she conclude about the genome?",
      "options": ["The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome: sensitivity to RNase A confirms RNA (not DNA), resistance to DNase I confirms no DNA component, and migration as a single band after denaturation indicates a single-stranded (not double-stranded) molecule since dsRNA would separate into two complementary strands", "The virus has a double-stranded DNA genome", "The virus has a double-stranded RNA genome", "The virus has no nucleic acid and is a prion"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This systematic nuclease sensitivity analysis reveals the genome type: (1) RNase A sensitivity: RNase A (ribonuclease A) specifically cleaves single-stranded RNA at pyrimidine (C and U) residues. Complete degradation by RNase A demonstrates the genome is RNA. DNase I resistance confirms it is not DNA. This immediately classifies the virus as an RNA virus (Baltimore Class III, IV, or V). (2) Single-stranded determination: When a double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA or dsDNA) is denatured (heated or treated with formamide/NaOH), the two complementary strands separate and migrate as two bands on a denaturing gel (or as a band with different mobility than the native molecule). When a single-stranded nucleic acid is denatured, it simply loses secondary structure but remains as a single molecule, migrating as a single band. The observation of a single band after denaturation indicates ssRNA. (3) Classification: The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome. To determine sense (positive or negative), additional tests are needed: if the purified RNA is infectious when transfected into plant cells, it is positive-sense (can be directly translated); if not infectious alone, it is negative-sense (requires viral RdRp). Most plant RNA viruses are positive-sense ssRNA (e.g., Tobacco Mosaic Virus, Potato Virus X, Cucumber Mosaic Virus). (4) Additional characterization: RT-PCR and sequencing would reveal the complete genome sequence. Electron microscopy of purions would reveal virion morphology (rod-shaped for TMV-like, icosahedral for others). Protease treatment before nuclease treatment confirms the nucleic acid is within a protein coat (capsid protects genome in intact virions).",

      "question": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, enters human cells using a specific receptor. What is the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry?",
      "options": ["The viral Spike (S) protein trimer binds human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD); the S protein is then cleaved by host proteases TMPRSS2 (at the cell surface) or cathepsins (in endosomes) at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide that inserts into the host membrane and drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes", "SARS-CoV-2 enters through receptor-mediated endocytosis using the transferrin receptor", "The virus injects its genome through the cell membrane like a bacteriophage", "SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by directly fusing with the nuclear envelope"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SARS-CoV-2 entry is a multi-step process involving receptor binding and protease-dependent membrane fusion: (1) Spike protein structure: The S protein is a large (~1,273 aa) trimeric class I fusion protein on the viral envelope. Each monomer has two subunits: S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (membrane fusion). S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues ~319-541). The RBD exists in two conformations: 'down' (receptor-inaccessible, immune-evasive) and 'up' (receptor-accessible). (2) ACE2 binding: The RBD in the 'up' conformation binds human ACE2 with nanomolar affinity. ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease normally involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7). It is expressed on type II alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and other tissues. (3) S protein priming: The S protein must be proteolytically activated: S1/S2 cleavage: The furin cleavage site (RRAR, a polybasic insertion not found in closely related bat coronaviruses) at the S1/S2 boundary is cleaved during biosynthesis in the producer cell's Golgi. This primes the protein. S2' cleavage: At the target cell, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) cleaves at the S2' site, exposing the fusion peptide. Alternatively, in cells lacking TMPRSS2, the virus enters via endocytosis and cathepsin L cleaves S2' in the acidic endosome. (4) Membrane fusion: The exposed S2 fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The S2 heptad repeat regions (HR1, HR2) fold into a six-helix bundle (6-HB), pulling the viral and cell membranes together and driving membrane fusion, releasing the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. (5) Therapeutic targets: Monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD block ACE2 binding. TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat, nafamostat) block protease priming. Fusion inhibitors targeting the 6-HB formation are in development.",

      "question": "The Hershey-Chase experiment (1952) provided critical evidence that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material of bacteriophage T2. What was the key experimental design that allowed them to distinguish between DNA and protein?",
      "options": ["They differentially labeled phage DNA with radioactive 32P (phosphorus, present in DNA but not in protein) and phage protein with radioactive 35S (sulfur, present in protein but not in DNA); after infection and blender treatment to separate phage coats from bacteria, 32P was found inside the bacterial cells while 35S remained in the supernatant", "They used electron microscopy to directly visualize DNA entering the bacteria", "They treated phages with DNase and protease separately to see which destroyed infectivity", "They sequenced the phage genome and compared it to the protein sequences"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment exploited the chemical differences between DNA and protein: (1) Rationale: In 1952, the debate between DNA and protein as the genetic material was ongoing despite Avery-MacLeod-McCarty's 1944 transformation experiments. Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage T2 because its biology was well understood: the phage injects its genetic material into E. coli while the protein coat remains outside. (2) Labeling strategy: Phosphorus (P) is present in DNA (phosphodiester backbone) but absent from amino acids/proteins. Sulfur (S) is present in proteins (cysteine and methionine amino acids) but absent from DNA. They grew T2 phage in E. coli cultures containing either 32P (radioactive phosphorus, labeling DNA) or 35S (radioactive sulfur, labeling protein) in separate preparations. (3) Infection experiment: 32P-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → after infection, blender treatment (shearing force) separated empty phage coats ('ghosts') from infected bacteria → centrifugation pelleted bacteria (heavier) from phage coats (lighter supernatant). Result: 32P was found primarily in the bacterial pellet. 35S-labeled phage infected unlabeled bacteria → same procedure. Result: 35S was found primarily in the supernatant (phage coats). (4) Interpretation: DNA (32P) enters the bacterial cell and directs phage reproduction, while protein (35S) remains outside. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material of phage T2. (5) Historical context: Combined with Avery's transformation experiment, Chargaff's rules, and Watson-Crick's structure (1953), this experiment helped establish the central role of DNA as the universal genetic material. Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize with Delbruck and Luria.",

      "question": "Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of protein. What is the molecular mechanism by which the prion protein PrPSc converts normal PrPC into the misfolded infectious form?",
      "options": ["PrPSc acts as a template that induces a conformational change in normal PrPC: the alpha-helix-rich PrPC refolds into the beta-sheet-rich PrPSc conformation through direct protein-protein interaction; PrPSc then recruits and converts additional PrPC molecules in an autocatalytic cascade, forming amyloid fibrils that are protease-resistant and accumulate as neurotoxic aggregates", "PrPSc contains a viral nucleic acid that directs the synthesis of more PrPSc", "PrPSc is an enzyme that chemically modifies PrPC through phosphorylation", "PrPSc causes mutations in the PRNP gene that change the amino acid sequence of PrPC"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The prion hypothesis, proposed by Stanley Prusiner (Nobel Prize 1997), describes a unique mechanism of infectious disease: (1) Normal PrPC: The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a GPI-anchored glycoprotein (253 amino acids in humans) expressed on the surface of neurons and other cell types. PrPC has a predominantly alpha-helical structure (42% alpha-helix, 3% beta-sheet). Its normal function is debated but may involve copper binding, cell signaling, and synaptic function. (2) PrPSc (scrapie form): The misfolded, disease-associated form has the SAME amino acid sequence as PrPC but a dramatically different conformation: 43% beta-sheet, 30% alpha-helix. PrPSc is insoluble, resistant to proteinase K digestion (yielding a protease-resistant core called PrP27-30), and resistant to denaturation by heat, UV, formaldehyde, and most sterilization procedures. (3) Conversion mechanism: The protein-only model proposes that PrPSc physically contacts PrPC and acts as a template for conformational conversion. The monomer conversion model: one PrPSc molecule converts one PrPC molecule in a 1:1 interaction. More likely, the nucleated polymerization model: small PrPSc oligomers (seeds/nuclei) recruit PrPC monomers to their growing ends, converting them to PrPSc. When fibrils break (fragmentation), more seeds are created, exponentially amplifying the process. (4) Amyloid formation: PrPSc molecules stack into cross-beta amyloid fibrils — extended beta-sheets with beta-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis. These fibrils aggregate into amyloid plaques visible histologically as spongiform change (vacuolation of brain tissue). (5) Prion strains: Different prion strains cause different disease phenotypes (incubation period, brain region affected) despite having the same amino acid sequence. This is explained by different PrPSc conformations — each strain represents a distinct stable misfolded structure that faithfully self-replicates. (6) Diseases: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, fatal familial insomnia (humans), scrapie (sheep), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE/'mad cow'), chronic wasting disease (deer/elk).",

      "question": "Bacteriophage T4 has evolved multiple mechanisms to take over the host cell's biosynthetic machinery. How does T4 redirect host RNA polymerase to transcribe phage genes instead of bacterial genes?",
      "options": ["T4 modifies the host RNA polymerase through ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit (by Alt and Mod proteins injected with the phage DNA), degrades the host DNA (using nucleases to recycle nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis), and replaces the host sigma-70 factor with phage-encoded anti-sigma factors and new sigma-like proteins (e.g., MotA, AsiA) that redirect RNAP to phage promoters", "T4 carries its own complete RNA polymerase and never uses the host enzyme", "T4 DNA is automatically preferred by host RNA polymerase without any modifications", "T4 inhibits all transcription and relies entirely on pre-made host mRNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "T4 takeover of host gene expression is a multi-pronged strategy executed in temporal phases: (1) Immediate early (0-2 min): Proteins co-injected with the T4 DNA (Alt, internal protein I): Alt is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that modifies Arg265 on one alpha subunit of host RNAP. This modification (occurring before any phage genes are transcribed) subtly alters RNAP promoter specificity to favor some T4 early promoters. MotA and AsiA proteins are expressed early: AsiA (Anti-Sigma 70 Inhibitor A) binds to region 4.2 of sigma-70, blocking its interaction with the -35 element of bacterial promoters. MotA (Modifier of Transcription A) binds to AsiA-modified sigma-70 and redirects RNAP to T4 middle-mode promoters that have a MotA-dependent element (MotA box) instead of a -35 sequence. (2) Host DNA degradation: T4 encodes several nucleases that degrade the host chromosome. T4 DNA is protected from its own nucleases by modification — T4 DNA contains hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) instead of cytosine, and HMC is further glucosylated by T4-encoded glucosyltransferases. This modified DNA is resistant to T4 restriction endonucleases that degrade unmodified (host) DNA. The degraded host DNA provides nucleotides for T4 DNA synthesis. (3) Alg (Anti-Late Gene silencing): At later times, the anti-sigma factor alters transcription patterns further. (4) Late gene transcription: T4 late genes are transcribed from late promoters that require the sigma factor-like protein gp33 and the co-activator gp55, along with the sliding clamp gp45 (T4 DNA polymerase processivity factor) loaded on T4 DNA. This couples late gene transcription to active T4 DNA replication — ensuring structural proteins are only made when DNA replication is well underway. (5) Net result: Within 5-10 minutes of infection, all host gene expression is shut down and the entire biosynthetic capacity of the cell is redirected to phage production.",

      "options": ["Integrase processes the 3' ends of the linear viral dsDNA by removing 2 dinucleotides (3' processing), then catalyzes a strand transfer reaction where the recessed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack phosphodiester bonds on opposite strands of target host DNA separated by 4-6 bp, creating a gapped intermediate that is repaired by host enzymes generating target site duplications (TSDs)", "Integrase uses homologous recombination to insert viral DNA at sites of sequence identity", "Viral DNA replaces an equivalent length of host DNA through a cut-and-paste mechanism", "Integration requires host topoisomerase II and occurs only at nuclear matrix attachment sites"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Retroviral integration is a well-characterized enzymatic process: (1) Integrase structure: A 32 kDa enzyme (288 aa in HIV-1) with three domains: N-terminal domain (HHCC zinc-binding motif), catalytic core domain (DDE catalytic triad: D64, D116, E152, which coordinate two Mg2+ ions essential for catalysis), and C-terminal domain (non-specific DNA binding). Integrase functions as a multimer (tetramer is the active form). (2) 3' processing: In the cytoplasm (within the preintegration complex, PIC), integrase recognizes the conserved att sequences at both ends of the viral DNA (CA dinucleotide at each 3' end) and removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end, exposing recessed 3'-OH groups (reactive hydroxyl groups). (3) Nuclear import: The PIC (viral DNA + integrase + other viral and host proteins including LEDGF/p75) is transported into the nucleus. LEDGF/p75 (Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor) is a host chromatin-associated protein that tethers integrase to active transcription units (targeting integration to gene bodies of actively transcribed genes). (4) Strand transfer: Integrase catalyzes a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction: the two exposed 3'-OH ends of the viral DNA attack the phosphodiester backbone of the target DNA on opposite strands, staggered by 5 bp (for HIV-1). This inserts the viral DNA into the host chromosome with 5 bp single-stranded gaps at each junction and 2-nt 5' overhangs of viral DNA that must be removed. (5) Gap repair: Host DNA repair enzymes (likely base excision repair and possibly NHEJ/HR pathways) remove the 2-nt overhangs, fill in the 5 bp gaps, and ligate the junctions. This generates the characteristic 5 bp target site duplications (TSDs) flanking the integrated provirus — a hallmark of retroviral integration. (6) Drug target: Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs: raltegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, cabotegravir) are potent antiretroviral drugs that block the strand transfer step by chelating the catalytic Mg2+ ions.",

After infection at time 0, they observe an initial eclipse period (0-12 min) during which no intracellular phage particles are detectable, followed by a latent period (0-25 min) during which no extracellular phage are released. At 25 minutes, cell lysis begins and phage titer increases rapidly, plateauing at ~200 phage per original infected cell (burst size = 200). What do the eclipse and latent periods represent?",
      "options": ["The eclipse period is the time required for phage components (DNA, proteins) to be synthesized before any complete virions are assembled; the latent period extends from infection to the first cell lysis event, during which complete intracellular phage accumulate after the eclipse ends but are not yet released because the cell membrane is still intact", "The eclipse period represents the time for phage DNA to replicate while proteins are already made", "The latent period is caused by a delay in phage adsorption to the host cell", "Both periods represent inactive phage that have lost infectivity temporarily"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The one-step growth curve, developed by Emory Ellis and Max Delbruck (1939), reveals the intracellular phage replication timeline: (1) Experimental setup: Bacteria are infected at high MOI (to synchronize infection). Unadsorbed phage are removed. At time intervals, samples are taken and: (a) plated directly (measures extracellular free phage), or (b) treated with chloroform (lyses cells, measures total phage = intracellular + extracellular). (2) Eclipse period (0-12 min in this example): During this period, no complete phage particles exist anywhere — not extracellular (no lysis yet) and not intracellular (components haven't been assembled yet). The phage genome has entered the cell and is being replicated and transcribed, mRNA is being translated into phage proteins, but individual components (capsid proteins, tail fibers, baseplate, DNA) have not yet been assembled into complete infectious virions. Chloroform lysis at this time releases only disassembled components — no plaques form. This period was first described by Anderson and Doermann (1952). (3) Post-eclipse, pre-lysis (12-25 min): After the eclipse ends, intracellular assembly begins. Complete phage particles accumulate inside the cell. If cells are lysed artificially (chloroform), increasing numbers of phage are detected. However, no phage are detected externally because the cell has not yet lysed naturally. (4) Latent period (0-25 min): The total time from infection to the first release of phage by natural cell lysis. It includes the eclipse period plus the maturation period. (5) Rise period (25-~35 min): Cells lyse (triggered by phage-encoded holins and lysozyme/endolysin), releasing assembled phage. The titer increases from 1 to ~200 phage per cell. (6) Burst size = 200: Each infected cell produces approximately 200 progeny phage. This number varies by phage type (T4: ~200, T7: ~100, lambda: ~100).",

      "question": "Ebola virus (a filovirus) has a negative-sense RNA genome. How does Ebola's VP35 protein help the virus evade the host innate immune response?",
      "options": ["VP35 is a double-stranded RNA binding protein that sequesters viral dsRNA replication intermediates, preventing their detection by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5; VP35 also directly inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and blocks IFN-beta production, effectively suppressing the type I interferon antiviral response", "VP35 stimulates the interferon response to help clear the infection faster", "VP35 is a structural protein that forms the viral envelope and has no immune evasion function", "VP35 degrades all host mRNAs to prevent interferon production"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Ebola VP35 is a multifunctional virulence factor that is critical for immune evasion: (1) dsRNA binding: During Ebola replication, the viral RdRp (L protein) generates dsRNA intermediates (replication intermediates and potentially dsRNA ends of panhandle structures). These dsRNA molecules are normally sensed by cytoplasmic innate immune sensors: RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I) recognizes short dsRNA with 5'-triphosphate ends, and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) recognizes long dsRNA. VP35 contains a dsRNA-binding domain (IID domain, residues 220-340) that binds and sequesters dsRNA, physically preventing recognition by RIG-I and MDA5. Crystal structures show VP35 caps the dsRNA ends, hiding the 5'-triphosphate from RIG-I. (2) Inhibition of RIG-I signaling: VP35 also directly interacts with PACT (Protein Activator of PKR), which normally activates RIG-I signaling. By binding PACT, VP35 prevents PACT-mediated RIG-I activation. (3) Inhibition of IRF3: VP35 inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3) by the kinases TBK1 and IKKepsilon. Without IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 cannot dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, or activate the IFN-beta promoter. This blocks the primary transcriptional induction of type I interferons. (4) Inhibition of IRF7: VP35 also inhibits IRF7 activation, blocking the amplification loop of interferon production. (5) Consequence: By simultaneously suppressing dsRNA sensing and IFN signaling at multiple points, VP35 creates an environment of unchecked viral replication. The absence of IFN-mediated antiviral defenses allows explosive viral replication in macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. This contributes to the severe pathology of Ebola virus disease (hemorrhagic fever, multi-organ failure, up to 90% fatality rate for some outbreaks). (6) VP24 cooperation: Another Ebola protein, VP24, inhibits IFN signaling downstream by blocking STAT1 nuclear translocation (binding karyopherin alpha1). Together, VP35 and VP24 create a comprehensive block of innate immunity.",

      "options": ["A quasispecies is a cloud of genetically diverse but related viral variants generated by error-prone RNA replication, centered around a master sequence; this diversity provides a reservoir of pre-existing variants including drug-resistant mutants, meaning that monotherapy with a single antiviral drug rapidly selects for resistance, necessitating combination therapy targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously", "A quasispecies is a single viral genotype that remains unchanged during infection", "Quasispecies theory applies only to DNA viruses with high-fidelity replication", "A quasispecies consists of completely unrelated viruses co-infecting the same host"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viral quasispecies theory, developed by Manfred Eigen and applied to virology by Esteban Domingo, describes the population genetics of rapidly mutating RNA viruses: (1) Error-prone replication: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and reverse transcriptases lack proofreading exonuclease activity. Error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle mean that for a 10 kb genome, essentially every newly synthesized genome contains at least one mutation. (2) Quasispecies structure: The viral population is not a single genotype but a dynamic distribution (cloud) of closely related variants. The distribution is centered on a master sequence (the most fit genotype in the current environment) but contains a vast number of minority variants at lower frequencies. (3) Selection unit: In quasispecies theory, natural selection acts on the entire mutant distribution, not just individual genotypes. The master sequence may not even be the most abundant genotype — the consensus sequence (derived from the most common nucleotide at each position) represents the population average. (4) Implications for antiviral therapy: (a) Pre-existing resistance: Due to the enormous population sizes (10^8-10^12 virions per patient for HIV, HCV) and high mutation rates, drug-resistant variants pre-exist at low frequency BEFORE drug treatment begins. For HIV, any single point mutation conferring drug resistance exists in the quasispecies at ~10^4-10^5 copies. (b) Rapid resistance emergence: Under monotherapy, resistant variants are rapidly selected, becoming the dominant population within days to weeks. (c) Combination therapy: Targeting multiple viral functions simultaneously (HAART for HIV: 2 NRTIs + integrase inhibitor; Harvoni for HCV: sofosbuvir + ledipasvir) requires multiple simultaneous resistance mutations to emerge, which is probabilistically extremely unlikely (~10^-10 x 10^-10 = 10^-20 for two independent mutations). (5) Error catastrophe: If the mutation rate exceeds a threshold (error threshold), the quasispecies cannot maintain genetic information and collapses. Mutagenic drugs (ribavirin, favipiravir, molnupiravir) exploit this principle by increasing the mutation rate above the error threshold — a strategy called lethal mutagenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The spot assay is the standard rapid method for determining phage host range: (1) Method: Each bacterial strain is grown to log phase in liquid culture. A thin layer of soft agar containing each strain is poured as a lawn on individual plates (or sectors of a single plate). Small volumes (5-10 uL) of serial dilutions of the phage lysate are spotted onto each lawn. Plates are incubated overnight. (2) Interpretation: Clear zone (zone of lysis): The phage can infect and lyse this bacterial strain. The zone may show individual plaques at low phage concentration or confluent lysis at high concentration. No clearing: The strain is resistant. Resistance can be due to: lack of the phage receptor on the bacterial surface, restriction-modification systems that degrade injected phage DNA, CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity targeting the phage, superinfection immunity (if the strain is a lysogen of a related phage), or abortive infection systems. Turbid clearing: The phage may be temperate (capable of lysogeny), producing turbid plaques due to immune lysogens growing within the plaque. (3) Efficiency of plating (EOP): For quantitative host range analysis, plaque counts on each susceptible strain are compared to the reference host. EOP = (plaques on test strain) / (plaques on reference host). EOP of 1.0 = equally efficient, <0.1 = restricted, >1.0 = the test strain is more permissive.

      "question": "HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to cure. What maintains the latent provirus in a transcriptionally silent state?",
      "options": ["In resting CD4+ T cells, the integrated HIV provirus is silenced by multiple epigenetic mechanisms: the 5' LTR promoter is associated with repressive chromatin (hypoacetylated histones, positioned nucleosome nuc-1 over the TSS), lacks active host transcription factors (NF-kB and NFAT are sequestered in the cytoplasm), and the absence of P-TEFb prevents Tat-mediated transcriptional elongation", "Latent HIV proviruses are deleted from the host genome and must re-integrate upon reactivation", "HIV latency is maintained solely by the absence of the viral Rev protein", "Latent proviruses continuously produce low levels of virus that are immediately neutralized by antibodies"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 latency is maintained by multiple reinforcing mechanisms at the transcriptional level: (1) Chromatin-based repression: The integrated provirus at the 5' LTR promoter has two positioned nucleosomes: nuc-0 (upstream) and nuc-1 (positioned directly over the transcription start site). In latency, nuc-1 is hypoacetylated and carries repressive histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3) are recruited to the LTR by host transcription factors YY1, LSF, and CBF-1 (the Notch pathway effector that recruits the corepressor complex). (2) Transcription factor absence: In resting CD4+ T cells: NF-kB (p65/p50): sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkBα. The HIV LTR contains two NF-kB binding sites essential for efficient transcription. NFAT: also cytoplasmic, requires calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for nuclear entry. AP-1: not active in resting cells. Without these inducible transcription factors, basal LTR transcription is extremely low. (3) P-TEFb sequestration: In resting T cells, the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T1) is sequestered in an inactive complex with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. Without active P-TEFb, even if RNA Pol II initiates at the LTR, it pauses at the TAR (transactivation response) element and cannot transition to productive elongation. The viral Tat protein normally recruits P-TEFb to TAR, but Tat levels are zero or minimal in latently infected cells (a chicken-and-egg problem). (4) DNA methylation: CpG dinucleotides in the LTR can become methylated, contributing to long-term silencing. (5) Latency reversal: T cell activation (antigen stimulation, PMA/ionomycin) activates NF-kB, NFAT, and P-TEFb, reactivating the provirus. 'Shock and kill' strategies use latency-reversing agents (LRAs) like HDAC inhibitors (SAHA, romidepsin), PKC agonists (bryostatin, prostratin), or BET inhibitors to reactivate latent proviruses, exposing them to immune clearance or antiretroviral drugs.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: HSV-1 ICP47 (Infected Cell Protein 47) is a small (88 aa) immediate-early protein that binds the TAP transporter (TAP1/TAP2 heterodimer) in the ER membrane. TAP normally translocates proteasome-generated peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules. ICP47 blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP from the cytoplasmic side, preventing peptide translocation. Without peptide loading, MHC class I molecules are retained in the ER (empty/peptide-receptive MHC I is unstable) and do not reach the cell surface. This renders HSV-infected cells invisible to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. S2 TRUE: Adenovirus E1A binds p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein), which are essential coactivators for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. By sequestering p300/CBP, E1A reduces histone acetylation at ISG promoters and blocks the ISGF3 (STAT1-STAT2-IRF9) complex from activating ISGs. E1A also blocks STAT1 signaling. S3 TRUE: Vaccinia virus (and other poxviruses) encode multiple secreted proteins that mimic host cytokine receptors. These viroceptors act as molecular sponges: viral TNF receptor homologs (CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, CrmE) bind and neutralize TNF-alpha, preventing its pro-inflammatory signaling. Viral IL-1 receptor homolog (B15R) binds IL-1beta. Viral IFN-alpha/beta receptor homolog (B18R/B19R) binds and neutralizes type I interferons. This is possible because poxviruses have large genomes (130-375 kb) capable of encoding many immune evasion proteins. S4 FALSE: Influenza NS1 (Non-Structural protein 1) is a potent innate immune antagonist with multiple functions: binds dsRNA (preventing RIG-I activation), inhibits the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 (required for RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination and signaling), blocks CPSF30 (inhibiting 3' processing of host mRNAs including IFN mRNA), and inhibits PKR activation.

      "options": ["TMV has a rigid helical rod structure (~300 nm x 18 nm) composed of ~2,130 identical coat protein (CP) subunits arranged in a helix around a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome; assembly initiates when a 20S aggregate (two-turn disk) of CP recognizes a specific origin of assembly sequence (OAS) in the RNA, and elongation proceeds bidirectionally as additional CP subunits add in a 5'-to-3' and 3'-to-5' direction", "TMV has an icosahedral capsid with 60 identical subunits", "TMV assembly requires host chaperone proteins and ATP hydrolysis", "TMV has a lipid envelope surrounding a helical nucleocapsid"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TMV is the paradigm for understanding helical virus assembly: (1) Structure: TMV is a non-enveloped, rigid rod 300 nm long and 18 nm in diameter, with a 4 nm central channel. The capsid consists of approximately 2,130 copies of a single 17.5 kDa coat protein (CP) subunit arranged in a right-handed helix with 16.3 subunits per turn and a pitch of 2.3 nm. The ssRNA genome (6,395 nt) is embedded between protein subunits in a helical groove, with 3 nucleotides per CP subunit. (2) Assembly initiation: CP subunits self-associate into various aggregates depending on pH and ionic conditions. At neutral pH, the predominant form is the 20S aggregate — a two-layer disk of 34 subunits. The 20S disk recognizes and binds the Origin of Assembly Sequence (OAS, also called the packaging signal), a specific hairpin loop structure located approximately 900 nt from the 3' end of the RNA (within the gene encoding the movement protein). The RNA threads through the central hole of the disk and inserts between the two layers, which then convert (jaws mechanism) from a flat disk to a short helix (the lock-washer form). (3) Elongation: Additional CP subunits (as disks or smaller aggregates) add to the growing helix. Elongation in the 5' direction is rapid because the RNA loop is pulled through the central channel, progressively incorporating more RNA. Elongation in the 3' direction is slower and may involve addition of individual CP monomers. (4) Thermodynamic principles: CP-CP and CP-RNA interactions are both important. RNA is NOT required for helix formation (CP alone forms helical rods in vitro at low pH), but RNA dramatically accelerates and nucleates assembly under physiological conditions. The OAS ensures that TMV RNA is preferentially packaged over host RNAs. (5) Historical significance: Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat (1955) demonstrated that purified TMV RNA alone was infectious (confirming RNA as the genetic material of TMV), and reconstitution of infectious virions from purified RNA and CP subunits showed that self-assembly requires no host machinery.",

      "options": ["During adaptation, the Cas1-Cas2 complex captures short protospacer sequences from the invading phage DNA and integrates them as new spacers into the CRISPR array; during interference, the CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into crRNAs that pair with tracrRNA and guide the Cas9 endonuclease to complementary sequences in the phage genome, where Cas9 generates a double-strand break adjacent to a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence", "CRISPR-Cas9 recognizes phage proteins rather than nucleic acids", "The CRISPR array is pre-programmed at birth and cannot incorporate new sequences", "Cas9 functions as an RNA polymerase that produces antiviral RNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system operates in three stages: (1) Adaptation (spacer acquisition): When a new phage infects the cell, the Cas1-Cas2 complex (Cas1 is an integrase, Cas2 is a structural scaffold) selects a ~30 bp segment (protospacer) from the phage DNA. Protospacer selection requires the presence of a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif, typically 5'-NGG-3' for S. pyogenes Cas9) flanking the protospacer. The selected protospacer is integrated at the leader end (5' end) of the CRISPR array, between the leader sequence and the first existing repeat. The repeat is duplicated in the process, creating: leader-new spacer-repeat-old spacer-repeat. This creates a chronological record of past infections. (2) Expression (crRNA biogenesis): The entire CRISPR array is transcribed as a single long pre-crRNA. A trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), encoded elsewhere in the CRISPR locus, has a region complementary to the repeat sequences and base-pairs with pre-crRNA. RNase III (host enzyme) processes the pre-crRNA:tracrRNA duplex into individual crRNA:tracrRNA units. Each mature crRNA:tracrRNA guide contains: the spacer sequence (20 nt complementary to the phage target) and the tracrRNA (which interacts with Cas9). (3) Interference (target cleavage): The Cas9 protein binds the crRNA:tracrRNA guide. Cas9 scans incoming DNA for PAM sequences (PAM recognition is the first step and occurs through protein-DNA contacts, not base-pairing). Upon finding a PAM, Cas9 locally unwinds the DNA and tests for complementarity with the crRNA spacer through Watson-Crick base-pairing (R-loop formation). If complementarity extends through the seed region (10-12 nt proximal to PAM), Cas9 undergoes a conformational change activating both nuclease domains: RuvC cleaves the non-target strand, HNH cleaves the target strand, creating a blunt-ended DSB 3 bp upstream of the PAM. (4) Self vs. non-self: The PAM sequence prevents self-targeting: the spacer in the CRISPR array lacks the PAM (the PAM is only present in the phage DNA flanking the protospacer). If the PAM is mutated or absent, Cas9 cannot bind and cleave. (5) Phage counter-defense: Phages evolve anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas systems by blocking DNA binding, preventing Cas protein loading, or degrading crRNAs.",

      "options": ["Viroids replicate entirely using host enzymes: nuclear viroids (like PSTVd) hijack host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II to synthesize complementary RNA from the viroid RNA template through rolling circle replication, producing multimeric linear intermediates that are cleaved by either host RNase or the viroid's own hammerhead ribozyme (in chloroplastic viroids) and ligated into circular monomers", "Viroids encode a small RNA polymerase within their circular RNA structure", "Viroids replicate through reverse transcription and integration like retroviruses", "Viroids do not replicate and are transmitted only as pre-formed molecules from parent to offspring"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viroids are remarkable in their ability to replicate using solely host machinery: (1) Structure: Viroids are small (246-401 nt) circular ssRNA molecules with extensive intramolecular base-pairing forming a rod-like or branched secondary structure. They contain NO open reading frames and encode NO proteins. (2) Two families: Pospiviroidae (nuclear viroids, type species: Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid, PSTVd): replicate in the nucleus. Avsunviroidae (chloroplastic viroids, type species: Avocado Sunblotch Viroid, ASBVd): replicate in chloroplasts. (3) Nuclear viroid replication (asymmetric rolling circle): The plus-strand circular viroid RNA enters the nucleus. Host DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase II (normally transcribes DNA → mRNA) is redirected to use the viroid RNA as template (an aberrant template usage). Pol II initiates at a specific site and continuously copies the circular template (rolling circle mechanism), producing long concatemeric minus-strand RNA. The minus-strand concatemer serves as template for another round of Pol II transcription, producing concatemeric plus-strand RNA. The concatemers are cleaved into unit-length monomers by an unknown host RNase (likely RNase III-like activity recognizing specific structural elements). Monomeric linear RNAs are circularized by host tRNA ligase. (4) Chloroplastic viroid replication (symmetric rolling circle): Both plus and minus strands serve as templates (using a nuclear-encoded chloroplastic RNA polymerase, NEP). Both plus and minus concatemers are self-cleaved by embedded hammerhead ribozyme motifs — catalytic RNAs that self-cleave through a transesterification reaction requiring a specific tertiary structure and divalent metal ion. Monomers are ligated by host chloroplastic tRNA ligase. (5) Pathogenesis: Viroids cause disease through RNA silencing: viroid RNA is processed by host Dicer into viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) that enter the RISC complex and silence host genes with complementary sequences, causing developmental abnormalities. (6) Significance: Viroids may represent relics of the RNA World — self-replicating RNA molecules that predate the evolution of proteins.",

      "options": ["The lambda CI repressor (encoded by the cI gene) binds cooperatively to the OL and OR operator regions, repressing the pL and pR promoters that drive early lytic gene expression; during induction by DNA damage, the bacterial RecA protein becomes activated as a coprotease that stimulates CI repressor autocleavage, destroying the repressor and allowing transcription from pL and pR to initiate the lytic program", "The prophage DNA is methylated by host Dam methylase preventing all transcription", "Host sigma-70 factor cannot recognize phage promoters while the phage is integrated", "The prophage is excised from the chromosome during lysogeny to prevent lytic gene expression"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Lambda lysogeny maintenance and induction: (1) The CI repressor is the key molecular switch. CI binds as dimers to the OL (operators left) and OR (operators right) regions. OR contains three binding sites: OR1, OR2, OR3. CI binds cooperatively: first to OR1 (highest affinity), then OR2, blocking RNA polymerase access to pR (rightward promoter for lytic genes like cro). CI bound at OR2 simultaneously activates its own transcription from pRM (promoter for repressor maintenance), creating a positive autoregulatory loop. At OL, CI similarly represses pL (leftward promoter for N gene and recombination functions). (2) CI dimers at OL and OR interact via DNA looping (long-range cooperativity), creating an octameric CI complex that further stabilizes repression. (3) At high CI concentrations, OR3 becomes occupied, which represses pRM — a negative autoregulatory mechanism preventing CI overaccumulation. (4) During SOS response (triggered by DNA damage from UV, mitomycin C, etc.): RecA protein binds to ssDNA gaps at stalled replication forks, forming RecA-ssDNA filaments (activated RecA*). RecA* stimulates the latent autocleavage activity of CI repressor. CI undergoes self-cleavage between Ala111 and Gly112 in the flexible linker connecting the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerization domain. (5) Cleaved CI can no longer dimerize or bind DNA cooperatively, and repression collapses rapidly (positive feedback: loss of CI at OR2 reduces pRM transcription). (6) With pR and pL derepressed: Cro protein is made from pR; Cro binds preferentially to OR3, preventing any residual CI expression. The N antitermination protein allows read-through of terminators. The Q antitermination protein activates late gene transcription (head, tail, lysis). (7) Excision: Int + Xis proteins catalyze prophage excision via site-specific recombination at attL and attR. (8) Lytic program: DNA replication (bidirectional then rolling circle), virion assembly, and host cell lysis (holin-endolysin system).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Calculating phage titer from plaque assay data: (1) The plaque assay is the standard method for quantifying infectious virus particles. Each plaque represents a zone of lysis initiated by a single infectious phage particle (assuming the Poisson distribution and that the multiplicity of infection is low enough that each plaque arises from one phage). (2) The formula for titer calculation: Titer (PFU/mL) = Number of plaques / (Dilution factor x Volume plated in mL). (3) Given data: 42 plaques counted, dilution = 10^-6, volume = 0.1 mL. (4) Calculation: Titer = 42 / (10^-6 x 0.1) = 42 / (10^-7) = 42 x 10^7 = 4.2 x 10^8 PFU/mL. (5) Key assumptions: Each plaque arose from exactly one phage (valid when dilution is sufficient); all viable phages formed visible plaques (some may be too small or turbid); the bacterial lawn was uniformly distributed; the volume was accurately measured. (6) Why PFU/mL and not particles/mL: The plaque assay only counts infectious particles. The actual number of phage particles (measured by electron microscopy or spectrophotometry) may be 10-1000 times higher due to the particle-to-PFU ratio — many particles may be defective, damaged, or unable to adsorb. (7) Statistical considerations: Reliable counts come from plates with 30-300 plaques (too few = high statistical error; too many = overlapping plaques undercount). The 42 plaques here are within this ideal range. (8) Plaque morphology: Clear plaques indicate fully lytic phages; turbid plaques suggest temperate phages where some bacteria in the plaque center have become lysogenic and are immune to superinfection.",

      "options": ["After membrane fusion mediated by gp41, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed in the cytoplasm using tRNA-Lys3 as a primer; reverse transcriptase synthesizes minus-strand DNA with concurrent RNase H degradation of the RNA template, then synthesizes plus-strand DNA using a polypurine tract primer, producing linear dsDNA with long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both ends; the pre-integration complex enters the nucleus through nuclear pores (using integrase and LEDGF/p75 host factor), and integrase catalyzes 3'-processing of LTR ends followed by strand transfer to insert the viral DNA into host chromosomal DNA", "The RNA genome is directly integrated into host DNA by a ribozyme", "Reverse transcription occurs in the nucleus after the RNA genome is imported through nuclear pores", "The viral DNA remains episomal and does not integrate into host chromosomes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HIV-1 reverse transcription and integration: (1) Entry: HIV-1 gp120 binds CD4 receptor on T cells, triggering conformational change exposing the coreceptor binding site. Gp120 then binds CCR5 (macrophage-tropic) or CXCR4 (T-cell tropic) coreceptors. This triggers gp41 conformational change: the fusion peptide inserts into the host membrane, and the six-helix bundle forms, pulling viral and host membranes together for fusion. (2) Uncoating: The viral core (capsid cone) enters the cytoplasm. Capsid uncoating is now understood to be gradual and linked to reverse transcription and nuclear import (not immediate). (3) Reverse transcription (in the reverse transcription complex, RTC): Step 1 — tRNA-Lys3 (packaged from the host cell) anneals to the primer binding site (PBS) near the 5' end of the genomic RNA. RT synthesizes minus-strand strong-stop DNA (-sssDNA) by copying the 5' end: R region + U5. Step 2 — RNase H activity of RT degrades the RNA in the RNA:DNA hybrid at the 5' end. Step 3 — First strand transfer: -sssDNA jumps to the 3' end of the same or the other RNA copy (template switching), annealing via the R region complementarity. Step 4 — RT continues minus-strand DNA synthesis toward the 5' end of the RNA template. RNase H concurrently degrades the RNA template but leaves the polypurine tract (PPT, a purine-rich RNase H-resistant sequence). Step 5 — The PPT serves as primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. RT synthesizes plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA), copying: U3-R-U5-PBS (including tRNA primer). Step 6 — RNase H removes the tRNA primer and the PPT. Step 7 — Second strand transfer: +sssDNA anneals to the minus strand via PBS complementarity. Step 8 — Both strands are completed, resulting in linear dsDNA flanked by LTRs (U3-R-U5 at each end). The LTRs were generated by the two strand transfers. (4) Nuclear import: The pre-integration complex (PIC) containing the viral dsDNA, integrase, capsid, and host factors (including LEDGF/p75) is transported through nuclear pores. HIV can infect non-dividing cells because its PIC actively traverses intact nuclear pores (unlike gammaretroviruses like MLV, which require mitosis). (5) Integration: Integrase (IN) catalyzes: 3'-processing — removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end of the LTRs, exposing reactive CA-3'OH groups. Strand transfer — IN creates staggered cuts in host DNA (5 bp apart for HIV) and joins each viral 3' end to a host 5' phosphate. Host DNA repair enzymes fill in the gaps and ligate, creating the characteristic 5 bp target site duplication (TSD) flanking the provirus. LEDGF/p75 tethers IN to chromatin and biases integration toward active transcription units.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Determining viral RNA genome sense (polarity): (1) The key principle: Positive-sense (+) RNA has the same polarity as mRNA and can be directly translated by ribosomes. Negative-sense (-) RNA is complementary to mRNA and must first be copied into mRNA by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) before translation. (2) The infectivity assay: If purified genomic RNA alone (naked RNA, no proteins) is introduced into susceptible cells and produces progeny virus, the genome must be positive-sense. This is because: The (+) RNA can immediately be translated by host ribosomes to produce viral proteins, including the RdRp needed for replication. No pre-existing viral proteins are needed to initiate infection. (3) For negative-sense viruses: Purified (-) RNA alone is NOT infectious because host cells lack RdRp — they have no enzyme that can copy RNA from an RNA template. The virion must carry its own RdRp (packaged during assembly). If purified (-) RNA is co-transfected with purified viral RdRp, infectivity is restored. (4) Protoplasts (plant cells enzymatically stripped of cell walls) are used because: Plant cells have rigid cell walls that block naked RNA entry. Protoplasts can take up RNA through PEG-mediated or electroporation methods. (5) Controls: Positive control: intact virus particles (should be infectious). Negative control: RNA treated with RNase before transfection (should be non-infectious). Mock transfection: buffer only. (6) Important caveats: Some (+) RNA viruses (like retroviruses) require reverse transcriptase packaged in the virion, so naked RNA would not be infectious despite being (+) sense. Ambisense viruses (some bunyaviruses) have both (+) and (-) regions on the same segment, complicating interpretation. dsRNA viruses: naked dsRNA is not infectious because the (+) strand cannot be released from the dsRNA duplex without viral proteins. (7) Alternative approaches: In vitro translation: (+) RNA will produce proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract; (-) RNA will not. Hybridization with mRNA: (+) genomic RNA will not hybridize with mRNA (same polarity); (-) genomic RNA will hybridize with mRNA (complementary).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HPV-mediated oncogenesis: (1) HPV is a small (~8 kb) dsDNA virus that infects basal keratinocytes of stratified squamous epithelia, entering through micro-wounds. (2) Early genes E6 and E7 are the primary oncoproteins. In low-risk HPV types (6, 11), E6 and E7 have weak transforming activity. In high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45), E6 and E7 have significantly stronger activity. (3) E7 protein mechanism: E7 binds pRb (retinoblastoma protein) through an LXCXE motif in the CR2 domain. This binding displaces E2F transcription factors from the pRb-E2F repressive complex. Free E2F activates transcription of S-phase genes (cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase). E7 also targets pRb for proteasomal degradation via cullin-2 ubiquitin ligase. Additionally, E7 binds and inactivates p21 and p27 CDK inhibitors, and disrupts HDAC complexes. (4) E6 protein mechanism: E6 binds the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP (E6-Associated Protein, also called UBE3A). The E6-E6AP complex acts as a neo-E3 ligase that recruits p53. E6AP ubiquitinates p53, targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. p53 is normally stabilized in response to DNA damage; its degradation eliminates the key checkpoint response. E6 also activates telomerase (hTERT) by inducing hTERT transcription, contributing to cellular immortalization. E6 additionally degrades PDZ domain proteins involved in cell polarity and growth control. (5) Viral integration: In high-risk HPV cancers, the viral DNA often integrates into host chromosomes. Integration frequently disrupts the E2 gene (E2 normally represses E6/E7 transcription). Loss of E2 leads to overexpression of E6 and E7. Integration is a critical step from low-grade to high-grade lesion progression. (6) Multi-step carcinogenesis: Initial HPV infection → persistent infection (immune evasion) → E6/E7 overexpression → p53/pRb inactivation → genomic instability (centrosome amplification, chromosomal aberrations) → accumulation of additional mutations → invasive carcinoma. This process typically takes 10-20 years. (7) This mechanism differs from acute transforming retroviruses (like RSV carrying v-src), which transform through viral oncogene expression. HPV transforms by inactivating tumor suppressors rather than activating oncogenes.",

      "options": ["In generalized transduction, any segment of host DNA can be accidentally packaged into a phage head when the pac site-based DNA packaging system mistakenly recognizes host DNA sequences; in specialized transduction, only host genes immediately flanking the prophage integration site (attB) are transferred when imprecise excision of the prophage generates a defective phage genome carrying adjacent chromosomal DNA", "Generalized transduction only transfers plasmid DNA while specialized transduction transfers chromosomal DNA", "Both types transfer the same genes but generalized transduction uses P1 phage and specialized uses lambda", "Generalized transduction requires conjugation pili while specialized transduction uses phage injection"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Transduction mechanisms: (1) Generalized transduction: Occurs during the lytic cycle of certain phages (e.g., P1, P22 in Salmonella). During normal lytic development, the phage degrades host DNA to nucleotides for phage DNA synthesis. However, host DNA is not completely degraded before packaging begins. DNA packaging in phages like P1 uses a 'headful' mechanism: the terminase complex recognizes a pac (packaging) site on concatemeric phage DNA, makes a cut, and threads DNA into the empty prohead until it is full (~110 kb for P1). Occasionally (~1 in 10^5 to 10^7 phage), the terminase mistakenly recognizes a pseudo-pac sequence in the host chromosome. A headful of host DNA (~90-110 kb) is packaged into the phage head. This transducing particle contains ONLY host DNA — no phage DNA. It can inject this DNA into a new host cell, where it can recombine with the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination (RecA-dependent). Any host gene has an approximately equal probability of being transduced (hence 'generalized'), though some regions near pseudo-pac sites may be slightly overrepresented. (2) Specialized transduction: Occurs with temperate phages that integrate at specific sites (e.g., lambda at attB between gal and bio operons). During lysogenic induction, prophage excision normally occurs by precise reciprocal recombination between attL and attR (catalyzed by Int + Xis). Rarely (~1 in 10^6), aberrant excision occurs: recombination happens between sequences flanking attL and attR rather than within them. This generates a defective phage genome that has lost some phage genes but gained adjacent host genes. For lambda: excision to the left captures gal genes (λdgal = lambda defective gal-transducing). Excision to the right captures bio genes (λdbio). The transducing phage is defective (cannot complete lytic cycle alone) and requires a helper phage for replication and packaging. Only genes adjacent to the integration site can be transduced (hence 'specialized'). (3) Practical implications: Generalized transduction is used for genetic mapping (cotransduction frequency indicates gene proximity, analogous to linkage analysis). Specialized transduction was used to clone genes (phage lambda vectors) and for fine-structure mapping of gene regulation.",

      "correctAnswer": "T, T, F, T",
      "explanation": "Analyzing each statement about Baltimore classification groups: S1 is TRUE: dsRNA viruses (Group III, e.g., Reoviridae including rotaviruses) face a unique challenge. dsRNA cannot be directly translated — ribosomes require ssRNA. Moreover, host cells have no enzymes that can transcribe RNA from an RNA template. Therefore, dsRNA viruses must package their own RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) within the virion. Upon entry, the RdRp transcribes the minus strand of each dsRNA segment into (+) mRNA, which exits the core particle for translation. Replication occurs within the intact core particle (a 'conservative' mechanism) — the dsRNA genome never becomes fully exposed in the cytoplasm, which prevents activation of innate immune sensors like RIG-I and MDA5 that detect cytoplasmic dsRNA. S2 is TRUE: Group IV (+) ssRNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses) have genomes with the same polarity as mRNA. Upon uncoating, the genomic RNA can be directly recognized by host ribosomes. For picornaviruses, the 5' end has a VPg protein (not a cap) and an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) that recruits ribosomes cap-independently. For coronaviruses, the 5' end is capped. The first proteins translated include the RdRp complex (replicase), which then replicates the genome. This is why purified (+) RNA is infectious — it is self-sufficient to initiate the replication cycle. S3 is FALSE: Most Group V (-) ssRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. Paramyxoviruses (measles, Sendai), Rhabdoviruses (rabies, VSV), and Filoviruses (Ebola) all replicate in the cytoplasm. They carry their own RdRp (L protein + P/VP35 cofactor) and do not require host splicing machinery. The exceptions are Orthomyxoviruses (influenza), which replicate in the nucleus because they use a unique 'cap-snatching' mechanism: the viral endonuclease steals 5' caps from host pre-mRNAs to prime viral mRNA synthesis, and their segmented genome requires nuclear splicing for some transcripts (M and NS segments). Bornaviruses also replicate in the nucleus. But the statement says 'exclusively in the nucleus' for all Group V, which is false. S4 is TRUE: Retroviruses (Group VI, e.g., HIV, MLV) carry (+) ssRNA genomes and package reverse transcriptase (RT). Upon entry, RT converts the RNA to dsDNA through the complex reverse transcription process involving two strand transfers. The viral dsDNA is flanked by LTRs and is integrated into host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme. Once integrated (as a 'provirus'), the viral DNA is transcribed by host RNA Polymerase II from the LTR promoter, producing both mRNAs for protein synthesis and full-length genomic RNA for packaging into new virions.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The holin-endolysin lysis system: (1) Endolysins: These are peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes synthesized in the cytoplasm. They accumulate in a fully active form in the cytoplasm during the late phase of infection. They cannot access their substrate (peptidoglycan in the periplasm/cell wall) because the intact inner membrane is impermeable to proteins. Endolysins lack signal peptides and are NOT secreted by the Sec or Tat pathways. Different phages encode endolysins with different specificities: lysozymes (cleave beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds between NAG and NAM), transglycosylases, amidases (cleave MurNAc-L-Ala bond), or endopeptidases (cleave peptide cross-links). (2) Holins: Small hydrophobic proteins (typically 100-150 amino acids) that accumulate in the inner membrane. They contain at least one transmembrane domain. During the latent period, holins exist as dimers and small oligomers in the membrane, maintained by the proton motive force (PMF). The holin allele determines the precise timing of lysis (the 'lysis clock'). At the genetically programmed time (typically 45-60 min for T4, adjustable by mutations): holins suddenly undergo a phase transition — they aggregate into large two-dimensional raft structures forming micron-scale holes in the inner membrane. This is an all-or-nothing event occurring within seconds. (3) Lysis cascade: Holin triggering collapses the PMF. The massive membrane lesions allow endolysin to flood into the periplasm. Endolysin rapidly degrades peptidoglycan. Loss of cell wall integrity + internal turgor pressure → osmotic lysis → release of ~100-200 progeny phage. (4) Antiholin: Many phages also encode an antiholin — a holin variant with an extra transmembrane segment that acts as a negative regulator. Antiholin forms heterodimers with holin, delaying the triggering event. The ratio of holin:antiholin tunes lysis timing. (5) Spanins: In Gram-negative bacteria, an additional component is needed: spanins (inner membrane and outer membrane spanning proteins) that disrupt the outer membrane. Without spanins, cells form spheroplasts but don't fully lyse. (6) Evolutionary optimization: The lysis timing represents a trade-off — earlier lysis releases fewer (but some) phage; later lysis allows more phage to be assembled but risks host death from other causes.

      "question": "Phage display is a powerful technique that links a protein's phenotype to its genotype. How does filamentous phage display work, and why is it useful for identifying high-affinity antibody fragments?",
      "options": ["Foreign DNA encoding a peptide or protein domain is fused in-frame to a gene encoding a phage coat protein (typically gene III encoding pIII of M13 filamentous phage); the fusion protein is displayed on the phage surface while the encoding DNA is packaged inside, allowing iterative rounds of binding selection (biopanning) against an immobilized target, washing to remove non-binders, elution of bound phages, and re-amplification to enrich for phages displaying the highest-affinity variants", "Phage display involves injecting purified antibodies into phage particles for delivery", "The technique requires lytic phages that lyse cells to release the displayed proteins", "Phage display only works with intact immunoglobulins and cannot display peptide fragments"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phage display technology: (1) The system: Filamentous phages (M13, fd, f1) are non-lytic phages that infect F+ E. coli through the F pilus. They are long (~900 nm) flexible rods with a circular ssDNA genome (~6.4 kb) enclosed in ~2700 copies of the major coat protein pVIII and 5 copies each of pIII, pVI, pVII, and pIX at the tips. (2) Display principle: A gene encoding a peptide, protein domain, or antibody fragment (scFv or Fab) is fused to gene III (encoding pIII). pIII is the minor coat protein at one tip of the phage (5 copies). The fusion protein is expressed during phage assembly and incorporated into the phage particle. Each phage displays the foreign protein on its surface AND carries the DNA encoding it inside — this physical linkage of phenotype and genotype is the key feature. (3) Library construction: Massive combinatorial libraries (10^8 to 10^11 unique variants) can be created. For antibody libraries: the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains are randomly combined and displayed as scFv (single-chain variable fragments, VH-linker-VL). Random peptide libraries: oligonucleotide synthesis with randomized codons (NNK or NNS codon schemes). (4) Biopanning: Round 1: The phage library is incubated with the target molecule (antigen, receptor, etc.) immobilized on a surface (plate, beads, or column). Unbound phages are washed away. Bound phages are eluted (acid elution, competitive elution, or enzymatic cleavage). Round 2-4: Eluted phages infect E. coli, amplify, and produce a new phage pool enriched for target binders. This pool undergoes another round of selection with increased stringency. After 3-5 rounds, individual clones are tested for binding (ELISA) and sequenced. (5) Why it works for antibodies: The immune system naturally uses a similar process (somatic hypermutation + clonal selection). Phage display recapitulates this in vitro. Advantages over hybridoma technology: no animal immunization needed, can select against self-antigens (no tolerance), can select under non-physiological conditions, and human antibody fragments are obtained directly. (6) Applications: Drug discovery (adalimumab — first fully human antibody drug, developed via phage display, approved 2002), epitope mapping, enzyme engineering, receptor-ligand identification. George Smith and Gregory Winter shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing phage display and using it for directed antibody evolution.",

      "question": "An experiment tracking influenza virus evolution during serial passage in eggs shows that after 20 passages, the virus has accumulated mutations at positions 226 and 228 of the hemagglutinin receptor binding site, switching its binding preference from alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid to alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. What is the most significant implication of this observation?",
      "options": ["These mutations represent the molecular basis for potential avian-to-human host switching, as human upper respiratory tract epithelial cells predominantly display alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids while avian intestinal epithelial cells display alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids; the ease of acquiring these mutations through serial passage suggests a relatively low genetic barrier for zoonotic transmission", "The mutations indicate the virus has become attenuated and safer for vaccine production", "This switching only affects binding to chicken embryo cells and has no relevance to human infection", "The alpha-2,6 binding preference makes the virus unable to replicate in mammals"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hemagglutinin receptor specificity and pandemic potential: (1) Sialic acid linkage specificity: Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds sialic acid (Neu5Ac) on host cell surface glycoproteins/glycolipids. The linkage between sialic acid and the underlying galactose determines host tropism. Alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids: predominant in avian intestinal epithelium (the primary infection site for avian influenza) and in human lower respiratory tract (deep lung alveoli). Alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids: predominant in human upper respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, nasal epithelium) — the primary site for efficient human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets. (2) Key residues 226 and 228: In H2 and H3 subtypes, amino acids at positions 226 and 228 of HA (using H3 numbering) are critical determinants of receptor specificity. Avian preference (alpha-2,3): Q226 + G228. Human preference (alpha-2,6): L226 + S228. These are the exact mutations observed in the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic viruses that switched from avian to human receptor preference. In H1 subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic), different residues are involved (D190/D225). (3) Structural basis: Position 226 is in the 220-loop of the HA receptor binding pocket. Leucine at 226 (hydrophobic) creates a narrower binding pocket that accommodates the more linear alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. Glutamine at 226 (hydrophilic) creates a wider pocket that accommodates the kinked alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. Serine at 228 forms hydrogen bonds that stabilize the alpha-2,6 interaction. (4) Pandemic implications: The observation that only 2 amino acid changes can switch receptor preference suggests a low genetic barrier for avian influenza viruses to acquire human-transmissible properties. This is why H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza are closely monitored — they are highly pathogenic in humans but currently lack efficient human-to-human airborne transmission. Controversial 'gain-of-function' studies (Fouchier 2012, Kawaoka 2012) showed that as few as 4-5 mutations in H5N1 HA could enable airborne transmission in ferrets. (5) The serial passage experiment demonstrates directed evolution in action — each passage selects for variants better adapted to the new host cell receptor landscape.",

      "question": "Restriction-modification (R-M) systems serve as a primitive immune defense in bacteria against phage infection. How does a Type II restriction-modification system protect bacteria while avoiding self-destruction?",
      "options": ["The R-M system consists of two enzymes with the same DNA sequence specificity: a restriction endonuclease that cleaves unmethylated foreign DNA at palindromic recognition sites, and a methyltransferase that adds methyl groups to the same recognition sites in the host's own DNA, protecting it from cleavage; phage DNA entering the cell is unmethylated at these sites and is rapidly cleaved before the methyltransferase can modify it", "The restriction enzyme only recognizes phage-specific DNA sequences that do not occur in bacterial genomes", "Methylation of phage DNA activates the restriction enzyme to cleave it", "The restriction enzyme is only expressed during phage infection through an inducible promoter"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Type II Restriction-Modification systems: (1) Components: Two separate enzymes — a restriction endonuclease (REase) and a DNA methyltransferase (MTase) — that recognize the same short palindromic DNA sequence (typically 4-8 bp). The REase cuts both strands of dsDNA at or near the recognition site. The MTase adds a methyl group (from S-adenosylmethionine, SAM) to a specific base within the recognition site (typically N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, or N4-methylcytosine). (2) Self vs. non-self discrimination: Host DNA is methylated on both strands at all recognition sites (fully methylated = protected). After DNA replication, newly synthesized strands are hemimethylated (one strand methylated, one unmethylated). The MTase rapidly methylates the new strand before the REase can cleave hemimethylated sites (REases typically cut unmethylated DNA much more efficiently than hemimethylated DNA). Foreign DNA (phage, plasmid from a different strain) enters unmethylated at the recognition sites. The REase cleaves this unmethylated DNA rapidly (typically within minutes of entry). The kinetic race: MTase and REase compete for unmodified recognition sites, but REase cleaves unmethylated DNA ~100-1000x faster than MTase modifies it, ensuring foreign DNA is destroyed before it can be protected. (3) Phage counter-strategies: Anti-restriction: phage T3/T7 encode an Ocr (Overcome Classical Restriction) protein that mimics DNA and competitively inhibits Type I REases. Base modification: T4 phage replaces cytosine with hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in its DNA, which is not recognized by most REases. HmC is further glucosylated for additional protection. Stimulation of host MTase: some phages encode proteins that activate the host MTase to quickly methylate phage DNA after injection. Acquired methylation: if a phage occasionally escapes restriction (probability ~10^-4 per unmodified site), its DNA becomes methylated and all progeny from that cell are modified and resistant to that R-M system. DNA injection strategy: phages inject DNA slowly, presenting fewer sites at once, reducing the chance of complete restriction. (4) Ecological significance: R-M systems reduce phage infection efficiency by ~10^2 to 10^8 fold depending on the number of recognition sites in the phage genome. They are considered the first line of bacterial antiviral defense (CRISPR-Cas being the adaptive second line). They also serve as 'selfish genetic elements' — loss of the R-M system genes leads to cell death because unmethylated chromosomal DNA is cleaved by residual REase ('post-segregational killing').",

      "options": ["First, sequence the viral genome and perform phylogenetic analysis to identify its closest relatives and predict its receptor binding protein; second, use pseudotyped virus particles bearing the novel virus's surface glycoprotein to test binding and entry into human cell lines expressing candidate receptors; third, assess replication competence in primary human airway epithelial cultures grown at air-liquid interface; fourth, evaluate pathogenesis and transmission in a suitable animal model such as ferrets or hamsters", "Immediately inject the virus into human volunteers to test pathogenicity", "Simply compare the genome sequence to known pandemic viruses using BLAST and make predictions without wet-lab experiments", "Only test the virus in standard Vero cell culture, which is sufficient to assess pandemic risk"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Systematic pandemic risk assessment of a novel virus: (1) Step 1 — Genomic analysis: Full genome sequencing (using Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, or PacBio) to determine the complete genome. Phylogenetic analysis places the virus within a known family/genus (e.g., Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae). Identification of the receptor binding protein (RBP) through homology to known viruses (e.g., spike protein for coronaviruses, hemagglutinin for influenza). Prediction of potential receptors using structural modeling (AlphaFold2) and sequence comparison of the receptor binding domain. Analysis of the furin cleavage site (if present), which can enhance pathogenicity (as seen with SARS-CoV-2). (2) Step 2 — Pseudotyped virus entry assays: Pseudotyped viruses (e.g., VSV or lentiviral particles bearing the novel virus's surface glycoprotein) allow safe study of viral entry without handling the novel pathogen at BSL-4. Test entry into human cell lines (HEK293T, A549, Calu-3, Caco-2) engineered to express candidate receptors (ACE2, DPP4, aminopeptidase N, etc.). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure binding affinity to purified human receptors. If no entry is observed into any human cell line, pandemic risk is lower (but not zero — receptor usage could change through mutation). (3) Step 3 — Replication in primary human tissues: Primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures at air-liquid interface (ALI) are the gold standard for respiratory virus assessment. These cultures recapitulate the pseudostratified epithelium with ciliated cells, goblet cells, and club cells. Key measurements: viral replication kinetics (growth curve), tropism (which cell types are infected, determined by immunofluorescence), cytopathic effect, innate immune response (interferon production, ISG expression), and apical vs. basolateral virus release (apical release facilitates respiratory transmission). Primary human intestinal organoids can assess enteric tropism. (4) Step 4 — Animal models: Ferrets are the standard model for respiratory virus transmission (similar respiratory tract anatomy to humans, sneeze reflex, can transmit influenza). Test direct infection (intranasal inoculation), contact transmission (co-housing), and airborne transmission (adjacent cages with airflow). Syrian hamsters are also useful (used extensively for SARS-CoV-2). Humanized mice (expressing human receptors, e.g., hACE2 transgenic mice) for pathogenesis studies. Monitor: disease signs, viral shedding, tissue tropism, immune response, and lethality. (5) Additional assessments: Serological surveys of human populations near the bat colony for evidence of prior spillover. Antigenic characterization to determine if pre-existing immunity exists. Assessment of susceptibility to existing antivirals. (6) Vero cells (Option D) are insufficient because they lack interferon response genes (deletion of type I IFN locus), so they don't recapitulate innate immune responses, and they don't reflect authentic human tissue tropism.",

      "question": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) constitute approximately 8% of the human genome. What is the evolutionary significance of ERVs, and how did they become fixed in the germline?",
      "options": ["ERVs originated from ancient retroviral infections of germline cells (sperm or egg cell precursors); the proviral DNA was vertically transmitted to offspring and accumulated mutations over millions of years that inactivated viral genes, preventing further retrotransposition; some ERV elements have been co-opted (exapted) for essential host functions, such as syncytin proteins derived from ERV envelope genes that are required for placental syncytiotrophoblast fusion in mammals", "ERVs were intentionally inserted into the genome by the host organism for immune defense", "ERVs only represent contamination artifacts from laboratory retroviruses", "ERVs are active retroviruses that regularly produce infectious particles in healthy humans"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Endogenous retroviruses in the human genome: (1) Origin: Over millions of years, retroviruses have occasionally infected germline cells (oocytes, spermatogonia, or early embryonic cells). When a retrovirus integrates its proviral DNA into a germline cell's chromosomal DNA, that provirus can be vertically transmitted to all cells of the resulting organism and to subsequent generations through Mendelian inheritance. (2) Accumulation and inactivation: Once fixed in the germline, ERV sequences are subject to neutral evolutionary forces (genetic drift, mutation). Over time, ERV sequences accumulate point mutations, deletions, and insertions that inactivate their genes: gag (capsid proteins), pol (reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease), and env (envelope glycoprotein). Solo LTRs: Homologous recombination between the two LTRs flanking a provirus can delete the internal viral genes, leaving a single (solo) LTR. There are far more solo LTRs than intact ERVs. The oldest human ERVs (HERVs) date to ~100 million years ago (shared across primate lineages), while the youngest (HERV-K/HML-2) had active members as recently as ~1 million years ago and may still have low-level transcriptional activity. (3) Genomic impact: HERVs constitute ~8% of the human genome (~500,000 HERV-related sequences), compared to only ~1.5% that encodes proteins. ERV LTRs serve as regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers, insulators, and polyadenylation signals for host genes. LTR-driven transcription has been co-opted for tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the placenta, testis, and immune system. (4) Exaptation (co-option) examples: Syncytin-1 (HERV-W env) and Syncytin-2 (HERV-FRD env): These are captured retroviral envelope proteins that are essential for placental development. They mediate cell-cell fusion to form the syncytiotrophoblast — the multinucleated cell layer at the maternal-fetal interface. Different mammalian lineages have independently captured different ERV env genes for this function (convergent exaptation). ARC (Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated protein): A neuronal protein derived from a retroviral Gag polyprotein. ARC forms virus-like capsids that package mRNA and transfer it between neurons, functioning in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. HERV-derived regulatory elements: The innate immune gene network is partially regulated by HERV-derived enhancers that are activated by interferons, suggesting ERVs helped shape the evolution of antiviral immunity. (5) ERVs and disease: Most HERVs are inactive, but aberrant HERV expression has been associated with: autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis — HERV-W and HERV-K), cancers (HERV-K expression in melanoma, breast cancer), and schizophrenia. However, causation (versus correlation) remains debated.",

      "options": ["Mimivirus has a genome of ~1.2 Mb encoding over 900 proteins, including genes for translation-related functions (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation factors), DNA repair enzymes, and metabolic enzymes not found in any other viruses; its particle diameter (~750 nm) exceeds that of some bacteria, and it can itself be infected by smaller virophages (Sputnik), paralleling the virus-host relationship seen in cellular organisms", "Mimivirus can reproduce independently without any host cell", "Mimivirus has a lipid bilayer membrane but no capsid protein", "Mimivirus is simply a large bacterium that was misclassified as a virus"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Giant viruses and the redefinition of viruses: (1) Discovery: Mimivirus (Mimicking microbe virus) was discovered in 1992 in the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga during a pneumonia outbreak investigation in a Bradford, England cooling tower. Initially mistaken for a Gram-positive bacterium due to its size (~750 nm diameter, comparable to Mycoplasma). Identified as a virus in 2003 by Didier Raoult and colleagues. (2) Genome: ~1.18 Mb linear dsDNA genome, encoding ~979 proteins. This is larger than the genomes of many obligate intracellular bacteria (Rickettsia prowazekii: ~1.1 Mb, Mycoplasma genitalium: ~0.58 Mb). Contains genes thought to be exclusive to cellular life: 4 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Arg, Cys, Met, Tyr), translation initiation and elongation factors, tRNA-modifying enzymes, topoisomerase (type IA and II), DNA repair enzymes (MutS mismatch repair, photolyase, nucleotide excision repair components), chaperones (multiple Hsp70/DnaK homologs), polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, and genes for 1-carbon folate metabolism. However, it lacks ribosomes and has incomplete translation machinery — it still requires the host cell's ribosomes for protein synthesis. (3) Particle structure: Icosahedral capsid (~500 nm) surrounded by fibrils (~125 nm long), giving total diameter of ~750 nm. A unique 'stargate' structure — a five-pointed star-shaped structure at one vertex that opens to release the genome during infection. Internal lipid membrane beneath the capsid. (4) Replication: Infects Acanthamoeba through phagocytosis. Establishes a 'viral factory' in the cytoplasm — a large compartment where viral DNA replication and transcription occur, analogous to the nucleus. The viral factory excludes host ribosomes (transcription inside, translation outside — paralleling the nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells). (5) Virophages: Sputnik virophage (discovered 2008) is a small virus (~50 nm, 18 kb genome) that co-infects Acanthamoeba cells along with Mimivirus. Sputnik cannot replicate without Mimivirus — it depends on Mimivirus's viral factory for its replication. Sputnik infection reduces Mimivirus replication efficiency and causes production of abnormal Mimivirus particles. This parasite-of-a-parasite relationship mirrors the virus-host dynamic of cellular life, suggesting Mimivirus occupies an ecological niche more like a cellular organism than a traditional virus. (6) Evolutionary implications: Giant viruses have reignited debate about whether viruses are 'alive.' Three hypotheses for their origin: (a) Genome reduction: giant viruses descended from a fourth domain of cellular life that gradually lost genes, becoming obligate parasites (the regression hypothesis). (b) Genome accretion: a simpler virus gradually acquired genes from hosts (the escape hypothesis applied in reverse). (c) Ancient origin: giant viruses represent an ancient lineage predating the last universal common ancestor. Phylogenomic analyses are inconclusive but suggest a complex evolutionary history involving extensive gene exchange between giant viruses and their hosts.",

      "options": ["The poliovirus genomic RNA is translated as a single polyprotein (~250 kDa) that undergoes co-translational and post-translational proteolytic processing by virus-encoded proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro/3CDpro; 2Apro performs the primary cleavage separating the structural (P1) from non-structural (P2-P3) precursors, while 3Cpro catalyzes most subsequent cleavages at specific Gln-Gly dipeptide sites, with the precise order and kinetics of processing regulating the temporal program of viral functions", "Host cell signal peptidases cleave the polyprotein as it passes through the endoplasmic reticulum", "The polyprotein is never cleaved and functions as a single multidomain enzyme", "Ribosomal frameshifting produces separate proteins from overlapping reading frames rather than polyprotein cleavage"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Picornavirus polyprotein processing: (1) Translation: The poliovirus genome (~7.5 kb) is a positive-sense RNA with a VPg (virus-encoded protein) covalently linked to the 5' end instead of a cap. Translation is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) in the 5' UTR, which directly recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit without scanning from the 5' end. A single open reading frame (~2200 codons) produces one large polyprotein (~250 kDa, 2209 amino acids). (2) Processing by 2Apro: The first cleavage occurs co-translationally between VP1 (C-terminus of P1) and 2A (N-terminus of P2). 2Apro is a cysteine protease that cleaves at its own N-terminus (autocatalytic cis-cleavage) between Tyr-Gly. This separates the structural precursor P1 from the non-structural region P2-P3 while the polyprotein is still being translated. 2Apro also cleaves host eIF4G (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G), shutting down cap-dependent host translation while IRES-dependent viral translation continues. (3) Processing by 3Cpro and 3CDpro: 3Cpro is the main viral protease, a cysteine protease with a serine protease-like fold. 3CDpro is the uncleaved precursor of 3C and 3D (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and has enhanced protease activity for certain cleavages. Together, 3Cpro/3CDpro catalyze 8-9 additional cleavages in the polyprotein, all at Gln-Gly (Q/G) dipeptide sites. (4) Processing cascade and functional regulation: The order and rate of processing are precisely regulated: P1 → VP0 + VP3 + VP1 (structural proteins for capsid assembly). P2 → 2Apro + 2B + 2C (2B disrupts membranes for replication complex formation, 2C is an ATPase/helicase). P3 → 3A + 3BVPg + 3Cpro + 3Dpol. Some intermediate precursors have distinct functions: 3AB localizes VPg to membranes for RNA replication initiation, 3CDpro has protease activity but also functions in RNA replication (binding the cloverleaf RNA structure). VP0 is further cleaved to VP4 + VP2 during virus maturation (this is an autocatalytic cleavage triggered during RNA encapsidation). (5) Temporal regulation: Early infection: 3CDpro predominates (before 3C/3D are fully separated), favoring RNA replication. Late infection: processed 3Cpro predominates, favoring structural protein processing and virion assembly. (6) Drug target: Protease inhibitors targeting 3Cpro (rupintrivir) have been developed as antivirals, paralleling the success of HIV protease inhibitors.",

      "options": ["Synthetic mRNA vaccines contain a modified mRNA (with N1-methylpseudouridine replacing uridine to reduce innate immune activation), a 5' cap analog, optimized 5' and 3' UTRs, and a poly-A tail, all encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that facilitate cellular uptake via endocytosis; once released into the cytoplasm, host ribosomes translate the mRNA to produce the encoded antigen (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in prefusion conformation stabilized by proline substitutions), which is then processed and presented via MHC-I and MHC-II pathways to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses", "mRNA vaccines insert the vaccine sequence into host chromosomal DNA using a viral integrase", "The mRNA is translated in the nucleus and the protein is exported for immune recognition", "mRNA vaccines require adjuvants because the mRNA itself has no immunostimulatory properties"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "mRNA vaccine technology: (1) mRNA modifications: Natural unmodified mRNA triggers strong innate immune responses through pattern recognition receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5) that detect 'foreign' RNA. Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman discovered that replacing uridine with N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) dramatically reduces innate immune activation while maintaining or improving translational efficiency. This modification is a natural modification found in human ribosomal RNA and tRNA. Additional modifications: 5-methylcytidine may also be incorporated. Codon optimization maximizes translation by using the most abundant tRNAs. (2) mRNA structure: 5' Cap: A synthetic cap analog (typically CleanCap, an enzymatic co-transcriptional capping system producing Cap1 structure: m7GpppA2'OMe) is essential for ribosome recruitment and mRNA stability. 5' UTR: Optimized for efficient ribosome scanning (Kozak sequence context). Coding sequence: Encodes the antigen with optimized codons. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer, mRNA-1273/Moderna): encodes the full-length spike protein with two proline substitutions (K986P, V987P) that lock the protein in its prefusion conformation — the immunologically preferred form that exposes the receptor binding domain. 3' UTR: Derived from stable mRNAs (e.g., beta-globin 3' UTR) to extend mRNA half-life. Poly-A tail: ~100-150 adenosines for mRNA stability and translational efficiency. (3) Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery: LNPs are ~80-100 nm particles composed of: ionizable lipid (e.g., SM-102 for Moderna, ALC-0315 for Pfizer) — positively charged at low pH for mRNA encapsulation, neutral at physiological pH; PEGylated lipid (prevents aggregation, extends circulation time); cholesterol (stabilizes the bilayer); DSPC (helper phospholipid). LNPs enter cells via macropinocytosis/endocytosis. The ionizable lipid becomes protonated in the acidic endosome, destabilizing the endosomal membrane and releasing the mRNA into the cytoplasm. (4) Immune response: The mRNA is translated by cytoplasmic ribosomes (it does NOT enter the nucleus and cannot integrate into DNA — there is no reverse transcriptase). Translated spike protein is: displayed on the cell surface → recognized by B cells → antibody production. Processed by proteasomes → peptides loaded onto MHC-I → presented to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Secreted protein is taken up by APCs → processed in endosomes → loaded onto MHC-II → presented to CD4+ helper T cells. The LNP itself acts as an adjuvant by activating the inflammasome. (5) Advantages over traditional vaccines: No live virus handling required (safety). Rapid development (sequence to candidate in days, not months). Manufacturing is sequence-independent (same process for any antigen). mRNA is transient (degraded within days, no genomic integration risk). Can encode prefusion-stabilized conformations impossible with inactivated virus. (6) Nobel Prize: Kariko and Weissman received the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their nucleoside modification discoveries that enabled mRNA vaccines.",

      "question": "The influenza virus replicates its segmented negative-sense RNA genome in the host cell nucleus, unlike most RNA viruses. What unique mechanism does influenza use to prime its mRNA synthesis, and why does this require nuclear localization?",
      "options": ["Influenza uses a cap-snatching mechanism: the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (a heterotrimer of PA, PB1, and PB2) binds to the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs via PB2, then PA endonuclease cleaves the host mRNA 10-13 nucleotides downstream of the cap to generate a capped primer, which PB1 then extends using the viral RNA template; this requires nuclear localization because nascent host pre-mRNAs with intact caps are only available in the nucleus before processing and export", "Influenza virus synthesizes its own cap structures de novo using a viral capping enzyme", "The viral polymerase uses VPg protein as a primer like picornaviruses", "Influenza mRNAs are uncapped and translated through IRES-mediated initiation"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Influenza cap-snatching mechanism: (1) The viral polymerase complex: Influenza RdRp is a heterotrimeric complex: PB1 (polymerase basic 1): the catalytic RNA polymerase subunit (RNA synthesis). PB2 (polymerase basic 2): the cap-binding subunit — recognizes and binds m7G caps on host mRNAs. PA (polymerase acidic): the endonuclease subunit — cleaves host mRNAs to generate primers. The polymerase is associated with each of the 8 viral RNA (vRNA) segments through interactions with the conserved 5' and 3' terminal sequences of vRNA. (2) Cap-snatching mechanism: Step 1 — Host mRNA capture: PB2 binds to the 5' m7GpppXm cap structure of host Pol II transcripts. The polymerase preferentially targets nascent pre-mRNAs still being synthesized by host Pol II, particularly snoRNAs, snRNAs, and mRNAs near their transcription start sites. Step 2 — Cleavage: PA endonuclease (a PD-(D/E)xK superfamily nuclease requiring two Mn2+ ions) cleaves the host pre-mRNA 10-13 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure, generating a short capped RNA fragment. The cleavage site preference is for a purine, especially G, proximal to a CA dinucleotide. Step 3 — Primer extension: PB1 uses this capped fragment as a primer to initiate transcription of the vRNA template. The 3' end of the capped primer base-pairs with the 3' UC residues of the vRNA template. PB1 extends the primer, synthesizing viral mRNA in the 3' to 5' direction along the vRNA template. Step 4 — Polyadenylation: When PB1 reaches the poly-U stretch (5-7 residues) near the 5' end of the vRNA, it stutters/reiteratively copies the U's, generating a poly-A tail on the mRNA. The polymerase then terminates. (3) Why nuclear localization is required: Nascent host pre-mRNAs are only available in the nucleus during active transcription by RNA Pol II. After export to the cytoplasm, mRNAs are associated with translation machinery and their caps are less accessible. The viral polymerase specifically interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Pol II to access nascent transcripts. Treatment with alpha-amanitin (Pol II inhibitor) blocks cap-snatching by eliminating the source of capped primers, confirming the dependence on active host transcription. (4) Consequences: Cap-snatching depletes host mRNAs, contributing to host shutoff. The heterogeneous 5' extensions (10-13 host-derived nucleotides) are visible in influenza mRNA sequences. PA endonuclease is the target of baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), an approved anti-influenza drug. (5) Comparison: Other segmented negative-sense RNA viruses (bunyaviruses, arenaviruses) also use cap-snatching but in the cytoplasm, using cytoplasmic mRNAs as cap donors. Only orthomyxoviruses (influenza) require nuclear localization for this process. Rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses do NOT cap-snatch — they encode their own capping enzymes.",

      "explanation": "Analyzing each statement about viral tropism: S1 is TRUE: HIV-1 tropism is determined by the coreceptor used. R5-tropic (macrophage-tropic) variants use CCR5 as coreceptor and predominate during early/chronic infection. X4-tropic (T-cell line-tropic) variants use CXCR4 and emerge in ~50% of patients in late-stage disease, often associated with accelerated CD4+ T cell decline. Dual-tropic (R5X4) variants can use either coreceptor. The CCR5 Delta-32 deletion (32 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene, found in ~10% of European Caucasians as heterozygotes, ~1% homozygotes) confers resistance to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection in homozygotes. The 'Berlin patient' (Timothy Ray Brown) was cured of HIV by receiving a bone marrow transplant from a CCR5 Delta-32 homozygous donor. The tropism switch from R5 to X4 involves mutations in the V3 loop of gp120 that change its charge and structure. S2 is TRUE: Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) has an exceptionally broad host range among warm-blooded animals. Multiple cellular receptors have been identified: nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction (entry point for peripheral neurons), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56) expressed on neurons, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) expressed on neurons. These neuronal receptors are highly conserved across mammals, explaining the broad host range. The virus enters peripheral nerve endings at the bite wound and undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the CNS. S3 is FALSE: While CR2 (CD21) is the primary EBV receptor on B cells, EBV can also infect epithelial cells (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), T cells and NK cells (associated with EBV-associated T/NK cell lymphomas), and smooth muscle cells (associated with EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors in immunosuppressed patients). EBV entry into epithelial cells uses different mechanisms: the viral BMRF-2 protein binds integrins, and gH/gL binds to ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2). CR2 expression is also found on follicular dendritic cells and some T cell subsets. S4 is FALSE: AAVs are actually excellent gene therapy vectors precisely because different AAV serotypes have different tropisms. AAV1 targets skeletal muscle, AAV2 targets liver and CNS, AAV5 targets lung epithelium, AAV8 has strong liver tropism, AAV9 crosses the blood-brain barrier and targets CNS and heart. This serotype diversity allows tissue-specific gene delivery. AAV-based gene therapies include Luxturna (AAV2 for inherited retinal dystrophy), Zolgensma (AAV9 for spinal muscular atrophy), and Hemgenix (AAV5 for hemophilia B).

      "options": ["e^(-5) = approximately 0.67%, meaning about 99.3% of bacteria will be infected by at least one phage", "50% of bacteria will remain uninfected", "About 20% of bacteria will remain uninfected", "No bacteria will remain uninfected at MOI = 5"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Poisson distribution in phage infection: (1) The Poisson distribution describes the probability of k independent events occurring in a fixed interval when the average rate (lambda) is known. For phage infection: lambda = MOI (average number of phages per bacterium). P(k) = (lambda^k * e^(-lambda)) / k! where k is the actual number of phages infecting a given bacterium. (2) Probability of 0 phages infecting a given bacterium: P(0) = (5^0 * e^(-5)) / 0! = 1 * e^(-5) / 1 = e^(-5) = 0.00674 = 0.674%. So approximately 0.67% of bacteria will be uninfected. Conversely, 1 - e^(-5) = 99.33% of bacteria will be infected by at least one phage. (3) Distribution of infections: P(1) = 5^1 * e^(-5) / 1! = 5 * 0.00674 = 3.37%. P(2) = 5^2 * e^(-5) / 2! = 12.5 * 0.00674 = 8.42%. P(3) = 5^3 * e^(-5) / 3! = 125/6 * 0.00674 = 14.04%. The most probable number is k = 4 or 5 (close to the mean). Many bacteria will receive 3-7 phages. (4) Why Poisson applies: Phage adsorption to bacteria is essentially random (each phage independently finds a bacterium). The number of phages is large. The probability of any specific phage infecting any specific bacterium is small. These conditions match the Poisson distribution requirements. (5) Practical implications: MOI = 1: 36.8% uninfected (e^(-1) = 0.368). MOI = 3: 5.0% uninfected. MOI = 5: 0.67% uninfected. MOI = 10: 0.0045% uninfected. To ensure virtually all bacteria are infected (e.g., for synchronous infection experiments), MOI >= 5-10 is typically used. (6) Limitations: Assumes all phages are equally infectious (no defective particles), all bacteria are equally susceptible, and adsorption is random. In reality, some phages may be defective, bacteria may vary in receptor density, and spatial heterogeneity exists in the culture. The actual number of uninfected cells may be higher than the Poisson prediction if the particle-to-PFU ratio is high.",

      "question": "Phage therapy is being revisited as an alternative to antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. What are the key advantages and challenges of phage therapy compared to conventional antibiotics?",
      "options": ["Advantages include high specificity (phages typically infect only one species or strain, sparing the beneficial microbiome), self-amplification at the infection site (phage numbers increase as they replicate in target bacteria), and the ability to degrade biofilms via phage-encoded depolymerases; challenges include the narrow host range requiring precise bacterial identification, rapid emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants, potential immune clearance of phage particles, and regulatory hurdles for personalized phage preparations", "Phage therapy kills all bacteria including beneficial commensals, similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics", "Phages cannot penetrate biofilms and are therefore ineffective against chronic infections", "Phage therapy has been proven completely safe with no immune response concerns"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Phage therapy advantages and challenges: (1) Advantages — Specificity: Phages typically have narrow host ranges, infecting only specific species or even strains of bacteria. This is determined by receptor-binding proteins (tail fibers, tail spikes) that recognize specific surface structures (LPS O-antigens, OmpC, FhuA, etc.). Specificity preserves the commensal microbiome, avoiding dysbiosis-related complications (C. difficile infection, fungal overgrowth). (2) Self-amplification: Unlike antibiotics (which are administered at fixed doses and are degraded/excreted), phages replicate at the site of infection. Each phage-infected bacterium releases ~50-200 progeny phages. This creates an exponential increase in therapeutic agent precisely where bacteria are present — a 'self-dosing' property. As bacteria are eliminated, phage numbers decline (density-dependent regulation). (3) Biofilm degradation: Many phages encode depolymerases — enzymes that degrade bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) that form the biofilm matrix. These are often carried on tail spikes or baseplate structures. Depolymerases can penetrate biofilm, exposing bacteria to phage infection. Some engineered phages express enhanced depolymerase activity. Antibiotics often fail against biofilms because they cannot penetrate the EPS matrix, and biofilm bacteria are metabolically quiescent (slow-growing cells are resistant to most antibiotics). (4) Challenges — Narrow host range: The same specificity that preserves commensals means that the exact pathogenic strain must be identified before treatment. This requires rapid diagnostic methods and maintained phage libraries (phage banks). Phage cocktails (mixtures of multiple phages targeting different receptors) partially address this. (5) Resistance: Bacteria rapidly evolve phage resistance (mutation rate ~10^-5 to 10^-8 per generation) through: receptor modification/loss (but this often reduces virulence or fitness), restriction-modification systems, CRISPR-Cas acquisition, superinfection exclusion. Counter-strategy: phage cocktails with phages using different receptors; phages that target virulence-associated receptors (resistance = reduced virulence). (6) Immune clearance: The human immune system recognizes phage particles as foreign (protein/DNA complexes). Antibodies (especially IgG, IgM) can neutralize phages. The reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen) can clear phages from circulation. Repeated administration may trigger stronger immune responses. Long-circulating phage variants have been selected. (7) Regulatory challenges: Each phage preparation is unique (not a standardized chemical compound). Traditional drug approval frameworks (FDA, EMA) are designed for defined chemical entities. Compassionate use/emergency authorization has been used successfully (e.g., UC San Diego case of Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis, 2016). Belgium and Georgia have established regulatory frameworks for magistral phage preparations.",

      "options": ["HBV is a pararetrovirus: despite having a partially double-stranded circular DNA genome (rcDNA), it replicates through an RNA intermediate; after nuclear entry, rcDNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that serves as the transcription template for host RNA Pol II; a greater-than-genome-length pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is packaged into core particles with the viral reverse transcriptase (P protein), which then reverse transcribes the pgRNA into rcDNA within the nucleocapsid", "HBV replicates its DNA genome entirely in the nucleus using host DNA polymerase like other DNA viruses", "HBV is an RNA virus that integrates directly into the host chromosome like a retrovirus", "HBV replicates in the cytoplasm without any nuclear phase"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HBV replication — a pararetrovirus strategy: (1) Genome structure: HBV has one of the smallest viral genomes (~3.2 kb). The genome is a relaxed circular partially double-stranded DNA (rcDNA): the minus strand is full-length with a terminal protein (P) covalently attached to its 5' end. The plus strand is incomplete (50-80% of full length) with an RNA oligomer at its 5' end. (2) Entry: HBV binds to the hepatocyte-specific receptor NTCP (sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) via the PreS1 domain of the Large surface antigen (L-HBsAg). After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the nucleocapsid is released and transported to the nucleus via nuclear pore complexes. (3) cccDNA formation: In the nucleus, rcDNA is repaired to form covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA): the viral P protein is removed from the minus strand 5' end. The minus strand gap (from the removal of the terminal protein) is sealed. The plus strand is completed by host DNA polymerases. RNA primers are removed and gaps are ligated. cccDNA exists as a minichromosome (associated with histones and non-histone proteins) and is the persistent reservoir of infection. cccDNA is extremely stable and is not directly targeted by current antiviral therapies. (4) Transcription: Host RNA Pol II transcribes cccDNA to produce several mRNAs: 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) — serves as BOTH the mRNA for core protein (HBcAg) and P protein AND the template for reverse transcription. 3.5 kb preCore mRNA — encodes HBeAg (secreted antigen). 2.4 kb mRNA — encodes Large surface protein. 2.1 kb mRNAs — encode Middle and Small surface proteins. 0.7 kb mRNA — encodes X protein (HBx, transcriptional transactivator). (5) Reverse transcription in the cytoplasm: P protein binds to the epsilon (ε) stem-loop structure at the 5' end of pgRNA. P protein (which contains a terminal protein domain, spacer, reverse transcriptase domain, and RNase H domain) initiates minus-strand DNA synthesis using a tyrosine residue in the terminal protein domain as a primer (analogous to adenovirus terminal protein priming). After synthesizing 3-4 nucleotides, the P-DNA complex translocates to a complementary sequence (DR1) at the 3' end of pgRNA (first strand transfer). Minus-strand synthesis continues (5' → 3' on the DNA, 3' → 5' on the RNA template), with concurrent RNase H degradation of the pgRNA template. A short RNA oligomer at the 5' end of pgRNA (including DR1 sequence) is NOT degraded by RNase H and serves as the primer for plus-strand synthesis. This primer translocates to DR2 (near the 5' end of the minus strand) — second strand transfer. Plus-strand synthesis proceeds until it reaches the end of the minus strand template (which circularizes through terminal redundancy), generating rcDNA. Plus-strand synthesis is typically incomplete because nucleocapsids are either enveloped and secreted (stopping further synthesis) or recycled to the nucleus (to amplify cccDNA pool). (6) Clinical significance: cccDNA persistence is why HBV infection is difficult to cure (current antivirals suppress but don't eliminate cccDNA). HBV integration into host DNA (random, not part of the normal replication cycle) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma through insertional mutagenesis and HBx-mediated effects.",

Which classic experiment addresses this question?",
      "options": ["The Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test: multiple parallel cultures are started from small inocula and grown independently without phage exposure, then each culture is plated on phage-containing plates; if resistance is pre-existing (random mutation), the number of resistant colonies will show high variance between cultures (fluctuation) because mutation occurred at different times during growth; if resistance is induced by phage, all cultures should show similar numbers of resistant colonies with low variance following a Poisson distribution", "A simple serial dilution plating experiment comparing resistant and sensitive colonies", "Growing bacteria in increasing concentrations of phage to select for resistance through directed adaptation", "Comparing the genome sequences of resistant and sensitive bacteria to find induced mutations"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Luria-Delbruck Fluctuation Test (1943): (1) Historical context: Before Luria and Delbruck's experiment, it was debated whether bacterial variants arose from random spontaneous mutations (pre-existing before selection) or were induced by the selective agent (directed/Lamarckian mutation). (2) Experimental design: Start with multiple (20-50) independent small cultures, each inoculated from the same parent culture with a very small number (~100) of phage-sensitive bacteria. Grow all cultures to the same final density (~10^8 bacteria) WITHOUT any phage exposure. Plate aliquots from each independent culture onto plates containing T1 phage (selective condition). Count resistant colonies on each plate. Simultaneously, plate multiple aliquots from a single large bulk culture as a control. (3) Prediction 1 — Random pre-existing mutation (Darwinian): Mutations occur randomly during growth, independent of phage presence. If a mutation occurs early in a culture's growth, that culture will have MANY resistant descendants (jackpot culture). If mutations occur late or not at all, few or no resistant colonies appear. Different cultures will show HIGHLY VARIABLE numbers of resistant colonies. The distribution will NOT follow a Poisson distribution but will show excess variance (variance >> mean). (4) Prediction 2 — Induced mutation (Lamarckian): Each bacterium has the same probability of becoming resistant when exposed to phage. The number of resistant colonies from each culture should follow a Poisson distribution with variance approximately equal to the mean. (5) Results: Luria and Delbruck observed extreme fluctuation in the number of resistant colonies between independent cultures (some cultures had 0 resistant colonies, others had hundreds — 'jackpot' cultures). The variance was much greater than the mean (variance/mean ratio >> 1). The bulk culture control showed low variance (Poisson-like). (6) Conclusion: Resistance mutations arise randomly and spontaneously before phage exposure (Darwinian selection, not Lamarckian induction). Phage acts as a selective agent, not a mutagenic agent. (7) Mathematical framework: Luria and Delbruck developed the 'Luria-Delbruck distribution' — a probability distribution that models random mutation with clonal expansion. The mutation rate (mu, mutations per cell per generation) can be estimated from the distribution of resistant colony counts. Modern methods (Ma-Sandri-Sarkar maximum likelihood estimator) provide more accurate mutation rate estimates. (8) Legacy: This experiment was one of the first rigorous demonstrations that evolution in bacteria follows Darwinian principles. It earned Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria (along with Alfred Hershey) the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (9) Modern note: While the Luria-Delbruck experiment conclusively showed that most resistance arises from random pre-existing mutations, some stress-induced mutagenesis systems (like the SOS response, RpoS-dependent mutagenesis) can increase mutation rates under stress, somewhat blurring the Darwinian/Lamarckian boundary — though these increase mutation RATE, not directionality.",

      "options": ["Coronaviruses encode a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN, carried on nsp14) that provides proofreading activity during RNA replication, removing misincorporated nucleotides; this is unique among RNA viruses and reduces the mutation rate approximately 15-20 fold compared to RNA viruses lacking proofreading, allowing maintenance of a genome large enough to encode the extensive replicase machinery, structural proteins, and accessory factors", "Coronaviruses use host DNA polymerase for replication, which has inherent proofreading", "The large genome is maintained by segmentation that allows reassortment to purge deleterious mutations", "Coronaviruses have a DNA intermediate stage where host mismatch repair corrects errors"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Coronavirus proofreading and genome size: (1) The RNA virus mutation rate problem: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) lack proofreading activity and have error rates of ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication cycle. According to Eigen's error threshold theory, there is a maximum genome size that can be maintained for a given mutation rate before error catastrophe (accumulation of lethal mutations faster than selection can purge them). For typical RNA virus mutation rates, the maximum genome size is ~15-20 kb. Most RNA viruses conform to this: picornaviruses ~7.5 kb, influenza ~13.5 kb total, paramyxoviruses ~15 kb. (2) Coronavirus exception: Coronaviruses have genomes of 26-32 kb — by far the largest among RNA viruses. This would be impossible without a mechanism to reduce mutation rates. (3) nsp14 ExoN proofreading: The coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex is encoded as two large polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1ab, the latter produced by -1 ribosomal frameshifting). nsp14 (non-structural protein 14) contains TWO enzymatic activities: N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain — belongs to the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases. C-terminal N7-methyltransferase domain — involved in mRNA capping. The ExoN domain proofreads newly synthesized RNA by removing 3' terminal mismatched nucleotides (analogous to the epsilon subunit of bacterial DNA Pol III or the 3'-to-5' exonuclease of eukaryotic DNA polymerases). nsp10 acts as an essential cofactor, forming an nsp10-nsp14 complex that activates ExoN activity. (4) Experimental evidence: Knockout of ExoN activity (by mutating the DEDD catalytic residues, e.g., D90A/E92A in SARS-CoV nsp14) results in: 15-20 fold increase in mutation rate, reduced viral fitness, increased sensitivity to mutagenic nucleoside analogs (like ribavirin, remdesivir), and in some coronaviruses, lethal loss of viability. ExoN-deficient SARS-CoV-2 mutants are attenuated and have been explored as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. (5) Implications for genome size: With ExoN proofreading, coronavirus mutation rates are ~10^-6 to 10^-7 per nucleotide per replication — closer to some DNA viruses. This ~15-20 fold reduction shifts the error threshold to allow genome sizes of ~30+ kb. The large genome encodes: 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) for replication, capping, proofreading, immune evasion. 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N). Variable numbers of accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, etc.). (6) Drug development implication: ExoN proofreading activity can excise chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (like remdesivir) that have been incorporated into the growing RNA chain. Remdesivir partially overcomes this through delayed chain termination (it is incorporated, allows a few more nucleotides to be added, then causes stalling — making ExoN-mediated removal more difficult).",

      "options": ["RSV is an acute transforming retrovirus that carries the v-src oncogene, a mutated version of a captured cellular gene (c-src proto-oncogene) encoding a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives uncontrolled cell proliferation; in contrast, slow-transforming retroviruses (like ALV) lack viral oncogenes and transform cells through insertional mutagenesis, where proviral integration near a cellular proto-oncogene activates its expression via the strong viral LTR promoter/enhancer, a process that is rare and requires long latency", "RSV transforms cells by directly mutating the p53 tumor suppressor gene through its reverse transcriptase activity", "Both RSV and slow-transforming retroviruses use the same insertional mutagenesis mechanism, but RSV does so more efficiently", "RSV transforms cells by producing a viral protein that directly binds DNA and activates growth genes as a transcription factor"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "RSV and retroviral oncogenesis: (1) Rous sarcoma virus (RSV): Discovered by Peyton Rous in 1911 — he showed that a cell-free filtrate from chicken sarcomas could transmit the tumor. Rous received the Nobel Prize in 1966 (55 years later). RSV is unique among retroviruses: it carries a viral oncogene (v-src) AND is replication-competent (retains gag, pol, env genes). Most other acute transforming retroviruses (v-abl, v-erbB, v-myc, v-ras, v-raf, etc.) are replication-defective because the oncogene replaces essential viral genes. (2) v-src mechanism: v-src encodes a constitutively active non-receptor tyrosine kinase (pp60v-src). The cellular proto-oncogene c-src (pp60c-src) is tightly regulated: its kinase activity is normally repressed by intramolecular binding of a C-terminal phosphotyrosine (Y527) to the SH2 domain, creating a closed/autoinhibited conformation. v-src lacks Y527 (truncated C-terminus) and carries activating point mutations → constitutively active kinase. Constitutive Src activity phosphorylates numerous substrates: Ras-MAPK pathway activation, PI3K-Akt pathway activation, STAT3 activation, cytoskeletal remodeling (via phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins), and suppression of cell-cell adhesion. This drives uncontrolled proliferation, morphological transformation, and anchorage-independent growth. (3) Proto-oncogene concept: Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus (1976 Nobel Prize) used a src-specific DNA probe to show that normal chicken cells contain a gene (c-src) closely related to v-src. This established the proto-oncogene concept: viral oncogenes are captured and mutated versions of normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) involved in growth regulation. Over 30 retroviral oncogenes have been identified, each derived from a different cellular proto-oncogene. (4) Slow-transforming retroviruses (insertional mutagenesis): Avian leukosis virus (ALV) lacks a viral oncogene. Its genome contains only gag-pol-env flanked by LTRs. ALV causes tumors with long latency (~6-12 months) and at low frequency. Mechanism: Proviral insertion near a cellular proto-oncogene (most commonly c-myc) results in: Promoter insertion: the viral LTR promoter drives overexpression of the proto-oncogene. Enhancer insertion: the viral LTR enhancer activates the proto-oncogene's own promoter (can act at distances of several kb, in either orientation). Insertional inactivation: rarely, proviral insertion disrupts a tumor suppressor gene. This is a two-step process: infection → random integration → rare integration near a proto-oncogene → clonal expansion → tumor. (5) Comparison: Acute transforming retroviruses: carry a viral oncogene, transform rapidly (days-weeks), transform at high frequency, often replication-defective. Slow-transforming retroviruses: no viral oncogene, transform slowly (months), transform at low frequency, replication-competent. Both demonstrate that dysregulation of normal cellular growth control genes can cause cancer.",

      "question": "Bacteriophage T4 employs an elaborate DNA packaging mechanism to load its genome into the icosahedral head. What motor drives this process, and how does it generate the force necessary to package DNA against the internal pressure?",
      "options": ["The T4 terminase complex (gp16 small terminase + gp17 large terminase) is an ATP-powered molecular motor that translocates dsDNA into the prohead through the portal vertex; gp17 functions as both the ATPase motor and the endonuclease that cuts concatemeric DNA, generating ~170 pN of force through an ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational change cycle that compresses the DNA to near-crystalline density (~500 mg/mL) inside the capsid", "DNA is packaged by osmotic pressure drawing it into the empty capsid", "The portal protein rotates like a turbine to screw DNA into the head", "DNA packaging occurs passively during capsid assembly around the DNA"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "T4 DNA packaging motor: (1) Overview: The T4 genome (~169 kb) is one of the largest phage genomes. DNA packaging is a critical step in virion assembly where the linear dsDNA genome must be actively translocated into a preformed icosahedral prohead (precursor capsid). The prohead contains an internal scaffolding core that is degraded by a prohead protease (gp21) before packaging. (2) Terminase complex: Small terminase (gp16): Recognizes the DNA (concatemeric DNA produced by recombination-dependent replication). Forms a ring-shaped oligomer (~8-11 subunits) that wraps DNA. Loads the large terminase onto the DNA. Large terminase (gp17, ~70 kDa): A pentameric ring-shaped ATPase motor. Contains two domains: N-terminal ATPase domain (ASCE superfamily ATPase) and C-terminal nuclease domain (cuts concatemeric DNA). The motor generates one of the strongest known molecular forces: ~170 piconewtons (pN), comparable to the stall force of kinesin but packaging DNA against enormous internal pressure. (3) Packaging mechanism: Initiation: Terminase recognizes and binds to the concatemeric DNA (T4 uses a headful packaging mechanism — it packages ~102% genome equivalents, creating terminal redundancy and circular permutation). The terminase-DNA complex docks onto the portal vertex (gp20 dodecameric ring) of the prohead. Translocation: gp17 pentamer acts as a two-phase motor: ATP binding causes the motor subunits to grip the DNA tightly. ATP hydrolysis drives a conformational change that pushes ~2 bp of DNA into the prohead per ATPase event. Each gp17 subunit alternately grips and releases the DNA (likely a sequential/rotary mechanism around the pentameric ring). The translocation rate is ~700 bp/sec (initially), slowing as the head fills due to increasing internal back-pressure. The motor packages ~10 bp per ATPase cycle (2 bp per subunit x 5 subunits). Termination: When the head is full (~169 kb, headful signal), gp17 nuclease domain cuts the DNA. The terminase-portal interaction is disrupted. Neck/tail proteins (gp13, gp14, gp15) attach to seal the portal and prevent DNA escape. (4) Internal conditions: The DNA inside the capsid reaches a concentration of ~500 mg/mL — near-crystalline density. Internal pressure reaches ~60 atm (comparable to 20 times the pressure in a car tire). DNA is arranged in concentric coils (spool-like arrangement). Counterions (Mg2+, polyamines like putrescine and spermidine) partially neutralize the DNA phosphate backbone charges. (5) DNA ejection: During infection, when the tail fibers bind to the bacterial surface, the stored energy from the compressed DNA drives initial ejection through the tail tube into the host cell. Internal pressure can push ~50% of the genome; the remainder may require active mechanisms (host factors or transcription-dependent processes).",

      "question": "The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway serves as an antiviral defense in plants and invertebrates. How does the siRNA-mediated antiviral response function in plants?",
      "options": ["During viral replication, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates or structured regions of viral RNA are recognized and cleaved by the plant Dicer-like enzyme (DCL2/DCL4) into 21-24 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); these siRNAs are loaded into Argonaute (AGO1) within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which uses the guide strand to target and cleave complementary viral RNA via the AGO1 slicer activity, and the signal is amplified by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR6) that synthesizes additional dsRNA from targeted viral transcripts", "Plants use antibodies to recognize and neutralize viral particles like mammals do", "Plant antiviral defense relies exclusively on programmed cell death with no RNA-based mechanism", "The RNAi pathway only targets transposons and has no role in viral defense in plants"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Plant antiviral RNAi: (1) Recognition of viral dsRNA: During viral replication, dsRNA is produced as: Replication intermediates of (+) RNA viruses (complementary +/- strand duplexes). Structured regions (hairpins, stem-loops) in viral RNA genomes. Products of viral RdRp transcription. These dsRNAs are aberrant molecules not normally found in plant cells and trigger the RNAi pathway. (2) Dicer processing: Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes in plants (unlike animals that have one Dicer, plants have multiple DCLs): DCL4 produces 21 nt siRNAs (primary antiviral defense). DCL2 produces 22 nt siRNAs (backup pathway if DCL4 is suppressed). DCL3 produces 24 nt siRNAs (involved in transcriptional gene silencing via DNA methylation). DCLs cleave dsRNA processively, generating siRNA duplexes with 2 nt 3' overhangs (a hallmark of RNase III family enzymes). (3) RISC assembly and targeting: siRNA duplexes are methylated at the 3' end by HEN1 methyltransferase (protects against uridylation and degradation). One strand (guide/antisense) is loaded into AGO1 (the primary antiviral Argonaute in Arabidopsis). AGO1 uses the guide strand to scan cellular RNAs for complementary sequences via Watson-Crick base-pairing. When a complementary viral RNA is found, AGO1's PIWI domain (which has RNase H-like slicer activity) cleaves the target RNA between positions 10 and 11 relative to the guide strand 5' end. The cleaved RNA is degraded by cellular exonucleases. (4) Signal amplification — secondary siRNAs: RDR6 (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase 6) uses cleaved viral RNA fragments as templates to synthesize new dsRNA (converting single-stranded viral RNA targets into dsRNA). This dsRNA is processed by DCL4 into secondary siRNAs, which enter RISC. This amplification loop generates a massive antiviral siRNA pool that far exceeds the initial trigger — a unique feature of plant (and C. elegans) RNAi not found in mammalian RNAi. SGS3 (Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3) stabilizes the RDR6-generated dsRNA. (5) Systemic silencing: The silencing signal can spread from the initial infection site to distant parts of the plant through plasmodesmata (cell-to-cell) and phloem (long-distance). Mobile siRNAs (21-24 nt, possibly as protein complexes) move systemically, establishing antiviral defense in tissues ahead of the infection front. This is analogous to vertebrate interferon-mediated systemic innate immunity. (6) Viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs): Nearly all plant viruses encode at least one VSR — proteins that counteract RNAi. Examples: P19 (tombusvirus) — binds siRNA duplexes, preventing RISC loading. HC-Pro (potyvirus) — inhibits HEN1 methylation and RISC assembly. P38 (turnip crinkle virus) — binds AGO1 through a GW/WG motif, mimicking GW182. 2b (cucumber mosaic virus) — binds AGO1 and dsRNA. VSRs are major virulence determinants — loss of VSR results in asymptomatic infection.",

      "options": ["Satellite viruses have genomes with no significant sequence homology to the helper virus and encode their own structural proteins, whereas defective interfering (DI) particles are deletion derivatives of the helper virus genome that retain replication signals but have lost essential genes; both depend on the helper virus for replication but DI particles compete with the helper for the same replication machinery, often attenuating helper virus replication and disease severity", "Satellite viruses and DI particles are identical concepts with different names", "DI particles are independently replicating viruses that do not need a helper", "Satellite viruses encode their own replication machinery but need the helper for structural proteins"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Satellite viruses vs defective interfering particles: (1) Satellite viruses: Defined as subviral agents whose nucleic acid has no significant sequence similarity to the helper virus. They encode at least their own capsid protein. They depend on the helper virus for replication machinery (RdRp, etc.). Example: Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV): a small (~1 kb) RNA satellite that depends on Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) as helper. The STMV RNA is replicated by TMV's RdRp but packaged in its own small T=1 icosahedral capsid. Satellite panicum mosaic virus (SPMV) depends on Panicum mosaic virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV): The most medically important satellite — depends on Hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its envelope (HBsAg). HDV has a circular ssRNA genome (~1.7 kb) that replicates using host RNA Pol II (like viroids) and encodes only one protein (delta antigen). HDV can replicate its RNA independently but requires HBV HBsAg for packaging, secretion, and infection of new hepatocytes. (2) Satellite RNAs (satRNAs): Even simpler than satellite viruses — they do NOT encode their own capsid protein. They are small RNAs (300-1500 nt) that are replicated and encapsidated by the helper virus. Example: satellite RNA of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). SatRNAs can dramatically alter disease symptoms — either attenuating or exacerbating disease depending on the specific satRNA-helper virus-host combination. (3) Defective interfering (DI) particles: Generated during high-multiplicity passage of virtually any virus. They are deletion mutants of the standard virus genome. They RETAIN essential replication signals (origins of replication, packaging signals, promoters) at the genome termini. Internal sequences (often encoding structural or accessory proteins) are deleted. They have SIGNIFICANT sequence homology to the helper virus (because they are derived from it). They cannot replicate independently (missing essential genes) but their genomes are replicated by the standard virus's replication machinery. They COMPETE with standard virus for replication and packaging resources. At high MOI, DI particles accumulate and suppress standard virus replication (von Magnus effect, first observed with influenza in 1951). (4) Ecological/evolutionary significance: DI particles act as molecular parasites of the helper virus. They create oscillating dynamics: standard virus produces DI particles → DI particles suppress standard virus → DI particles decline without helper → standard virus recovers. This cycling can attenuate disease severity and may benefit the host. DI particles have been explored as antiviral therapeutics (therapeutic interfering particles, TIPs). Satellite viruses may represent ancient relationships between different genetic elements — possibly remnants of a primordial RNA world where genetic cooperation and parasitism were common. (5) Key distinction: Satellites have NO sequence relationship to the helper (different evolutionary origin). DI particles ARE derived from the helper (same evolutionary origin but with deletions).",

      "question": "Superinfection exclusion is a phenomenon where a cell already infected by one virus becomes resistant to infection by the same or closely related viruses. What molecular mechanisms underlie superinfection exclusion in bacteriophages?",
      "options": ["Multiple mechanisms operate: (1) receptor modification — early phage gene products alter or destroy the receptor used for phage adsorption (e.g., T4 encodes rIII that modifies the OmpC receptor); (2) injection blocking — phage proteins inserted into the membrane block DNA translocation by superinfecting phages; (3) restriction of incoming DNA — some prophage-encoded systems degrade incoming phage DNA; all mechanisms prevent wasteful competition for the same cellular resources by a second phage", "Superinfection exclusion only occurs through CRISPR-Cas immunity", "The first phage physically occupies all receptors on the cell surface, blocking secondary attachment", "Superinfection exclusion is an artifact of laboratory conditions and does not occur in nature"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Superinfection exclusion mechanisms: (1) Concept: Superinfection exclusion (SIE, also called superinfection immunity or superinfection resistance) prevents a cell already infected by one virus from being productively infected by a closely related virus. This is distinct from lysogenic immunity (CI repressor-mediated) and restriction-modification systems. SIE acts at the level of viral entry or very early post-entry steps. (2) Receptor modification/destruction: T4 phage (lytic): Immediately after infection, T4 expresses genes that modify the bacterial surface. The rIII gene product and other early proteins alter or destroy the receptor(s) used by T4 for adsorption. T4 also glycosylates its own DNA (hydroxymethylcytosine + glucose modifications) to distinguish self from non-self and to resist restriction enzymes. Many phages encode receptor-modifying enzymes (acetylases, glycosyltransferases) that alter LPS, OmpC, or other surface structures. (3) Membrane-level exclusion — Injection blocking: Phage T4: The Imm (immunity) and sp (spackle/gp61) gene products insert into the inner membrane shortly after infection. Imm protein blocks DNA injection by superinfecting T4 through the inner membrane (but doesn't prevent phage adsorption to the outer membrane). Sp protein blocks the lysis induced by superinfecting T-even phages by blocking a lysis pathway. Lambdoid phages: The SieA and SieB exclusion systems (encoded by lambda prophage): SieA blocks DNA injection of superinfecting phages at the inner membrane. SieB triggers abortive infection (premature lysis) of cells that manage to be superinfected, sacrificing the cell to prevent phage production. (4) DNA degradation: Some prophage-encoded systems function analogously to restriction-modification: they degrade incoming phage DNA while protecting the resident prophage/host DNA. This overlaps with but is distinct from classical R-M systems. (5) Lambda lysogenic immunity (distinct from SIE): CI repressor produced by the resident prophage binds to operators of incoming lambda DNA, preventing lytic development. This is sequence-specific — a lambda lysogen is immune to superinfection by lambda but not by phage P22 (different operators). This is technically superinfection immunity, not exclusion — the incoming DNA enters but cannot develop, rather than being blocked from entering. (6) Ecological significance: SIE provides a competitive advantage to the first phage to infect a cell. It prevents wasteful competition for cellular resources (ribosomes, nucleotides, energy). For temperate phages, it protects the lysogenic investment — if a second phage could superinfect and lyse the cell, the resident prophage would also be destroyed. SIE is analogous to superinfection exclusion in eukaryotic viruses (e.g., HIV envelope-mediated CD4 downregulation prevents secondary HIV infection; influenza NA cleaves sialic acid receptors).",

      "options": ["Successful zoonotic emergence requires overcoming multiple barriers: (1) exposure — sufficient contact between reservoir host and humans; (2) infection — the virus must bind human cell receptors and evade initial innate immune defenses; (3) adaptation — mutations enabling efficient replication in human cells; (4) transmission — the virus must replicate to sufficient titers in anatomical compartments that facilitate human-to-human spread; most animal viruses fail at one or more of these barriers", "Any animal virus can immediately infect and transmit between humans without requiring adaptation", "Zoonotic emergence is entirely random and cannot be predicted from viral or ecological factors", "Only DNA viruses can cross the species barrier because RNA viruses mutate too rapidly"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Zoonotic viral emergence barriers: (1) Exposure barrier: Ecological factors determine human-animal contact frequency. Deforestation, agricultural intensification, bushmeat hunting, live animal markets, and urbanization increase spillover opportunities. Reservoir hosts often show no disease (bats harbor coronaviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses; rodents harbor hantaviruses, arenaviruses; birds harbor influenza). Intermediate/amplifier hosts may be needed (civets for SARS-CoV-1, camels for MERS-CoV, pigs for Nipah). (2) Infection barrier — Receptor compatibility: The viral attachment protein must bind a human receptor with sufficient affinity. SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD binds human ACE2 with high affinity. Avian influenza H5N1 HA binds alpha-2,3-sialic acid poorly binds alpha-2,6-sialic acid (human upper respiratory tract). Innate immune evasion: The virus must counteract human interferon responses. Species-specific restriction factors (TRIM5alpha, tetherin/BST-2, APOBEC3G, MxA) may block replication of animal viruses in human cells. (3) Adaptation barrier: Polymerase adaptation: Avian influenza PB2 has E627 which functions well at avian body temperature (40-41C) but poorly at human upper airway temperature (33C). The E627K mutation adapts the polymerase to mammalian temperature. Codon usage optimization improves translation efficiency. (4) Transmission barrier: Most critical and least frequently crossed. The virus must replicate to high titers, be present in transmissible body fluids/aerosols, survive in the environment, and infect new hosts before the current host dies. The R0 must exceed 1 for sustained transmission. (5) Examples: SARS-CoV-2 had high ACE2 binding affinity and a furin cleavage site enabling pandemic spread. HIV-1 had multiple cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees but only Group M achieved pandemic spread. Ebola repeatedly spills over from bats but has limited human-to-human transmission (R0 = 1.5-2.5, requires direct contact with body fluids).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Replication-incompetent viral vectors: (1) Design principle: Essential viral genes are deleted from the viral genome. The foreign antigen gene is inserted in place of or alongside remaining viral genes. A complementing cell line stably expresses the deleted essential gene(s). In complementing cells: vector genome is replicated, viral proteins including the complemented essential protein are expressed, and infectious vector particles are assembled. In normal cells: the vector can infect and express the foreign antigen but CANNOT produce infectious progeny because the essential gene product is absent.

Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA): Lost ~30 kb of genome through >570 passages. Can infect mammalian cells but cannot complete replication cycle. Lentiviral vectors (from HIV-1): Third-generation vectors split essential genes across 4 plasmids. Self-inactivating design with deleted U3 promoter. (3) Safety advantages: No risk of reversion to virulence (unlike live attenuated vaccines in option B). Safe for immunocompromised individuals. Better immunogenicity than inactivated vaccines (option D) because intracellular antigen production stimulates both MHC-I and MHC-II pathways.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Abortive infection systems: (1) Concept: Abi systems sacrifice the infected cell to protect the bacterial population. This is programmed cell death analogous to apoptosis in multicellular organisms. (2) The Rex system (lambda prophage-encoded): RexA is activated by phage DNA-protein complexes. RexA activates RexB, an inner membrane ion channel. RexB collapses the membrane potential causing ATP depletion, cessation of macromolecular synthesis, and cell death before the phage completes its replication cycle. (3) Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems: Normal state: labile antitoxin neutralizes the toxin. During phage infection: if the phage disrupts host gene expression, the labile antitoxin is degraded faster than replenished. Free toxin kills the cell. Examples: MazE/MazF (mRNA interferase), ToxI/ToxN (endoribonuclease). Phages counter TA systems by encoding antitoxin mimics (T4 Dmd protein). (4) Retron-based defense: Retrons produce multicopy single-stranded DNA via reverse transcriptase. The retron functions as a sensor — phage-encoded anti-defense proteins inadvertently trigger the retron sensor, activating an effector toxin that kills the cell. (5) CBASS system: Phage infection activates a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase producing cyclic oligonucleotides that activate effector proteins (phospholipases, endonucleases, pore-forming proteins) killing the cell. Analogous to the mammalian cGAS-STING pathway.

What evolutionary process does this dN/dS ratio indicate?",
      "options": ["A dN/dS ratio greater than 1 indicates positive (diversifying) selection at these antigenic sites, meaning amino acid changes are being selectively favored because they help the virus escape pre-existing antibody immunity in the host population; this contrasts with the genome-wide dN/dS of ~0.1-0.3, which indicates purifying selection maintaining protein function at most sites", "A dN/dS ratio of 1.6 indicates neutral evolution with no selective pressure", "This ratio indicates purifying selection removing harmful mutations from the viral population", "The dN/dS ratio indicates the virus is evolving more slowly than expected under neutral drift"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "dN/dS analysis and influenza evolution: (1) Understanding dN/dS: dS is the rate of synonymous (silent) mutations serving as the neutral baseline. dN is the rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) mutations subject to selection. (2) Interpretation: dN/dS < 1: Purifying selection (amino acid changes removed as deleterious). dN/dS = 1: Neutral evolution. dN/dS > 1: Positive selection (amino acid changes favored). (3) Influenza HA antigenic sites: dN/dS = 1.6 means amino acid substitutions are occurring 60% faster than neutral expectation. This is strong evidence for immune-driven positive selection (antigenic drift). Viruses with altered antigenic sites escape pre-existing antibodies, gaining reproductive advantage.

      "question": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is used by many viruses to regulate the ratio of different protein products. How does the -1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism work in HIV-1 to produce the Gag-Pol polyprotein?",
      "options": ["A slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) causes the ribosome to shift one nucleotide in the 5' direction at ~5-10% frequency, allowing read-through of the gag stop codon into the pol reading frame; efficiency is enhanced by a downstream RNA secondary structure that pauses the ribosome at the slippery site, and this ratio ensures Gag is produced in ~20-fold excess over Gag-Pol, maintaining correct stoichiometry for virion assembly", "HIV-1 produces Gag and Pol from two separate mRNAs generated by alternative splicing", "An internal ribosome entry site between gag and pol initiates independent translation of Pol", "Gag and Pol are produced from the same reading frame with no frameshift required"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1: (1) Context: gag and pol are in overlapping reading frames, with pol in the -1 frame relative to gag. A stop codon at the end of gag normally terminates translation. (2) The slippery sequence: U UUU UUA allows simultaneous tRNA slippage at the A and P sites. After slipping one nucleotide 5'-ward, tRNAs can re-pair in the -1 frame due to the repetitive sequence. Translation continues through pol. (3) Stimulatory RNA structure: A stem-loop downstream causes ribosome pausing, increasing frameshifting probability. (4) Stoichiometry: ~5-10% frameshifting produces ~10-20:1 Gag:Gag-Pol ratio. This is critical: too much Gag-Pol causes premature protease activation and defective assembly; too little means insufficient RT and IN. Even 2-fold changes in frameshifting are lethal. (5) Processing: Gag-Pol is incorporated into virions alongside Gag. The protease domain self-activates as a homodimer and cleaves both polyproteins into MA, CA, NC, p6, PR, RT, and IN. Protease inhibitors target this step. (6) Other viruses using -1 frameshifting: Coronaviruses (ORF1a/1b junction, ~25-30% efficiency using a pseudoknot), HTLV-1, astroviruses, and many plant viruses. Frameshifting itself is a potential antiviral drug target.",

      "options": ["TMV assembles via nucleation-elongation: a 20S protein disk binds a specific origin-of-assembly sequence on the RNA, then additional subunits add as RNA threads through the growing helix; poliovirus follows hierarchical assembly where 5S protomers form 14S pentamers, twelve pentamers assemble into an empty 75S procapsid, then genomic RNA is inserted, and VP0 is autocatalytically cleaved to VP4+VP2 to yield the mature 160S virion", "Both TMV and poliovirus assemble by simultaneous condensation of protein around pre-formed RNA", "Both viruses require the host endoplasmic reticulum for assembly", "TMV assembles inside the nucleus while poliovirus assembles in the cytoplasm"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Viral assembly pathways: (1) TMV helical assembly (elucidated by Aaron Klug, Nobel 1982): Coat protein forms 20S disk aggregates (two-layered ring of 34 subunits). Nucleation: 20S disk binds to the origin-of-assembly sequence ~900 nt from the 3' end. Upon RNA binding, the disk transitions from flat ring to helical lock-washer conformation. Elongation: Additional disks add, RNA threads through central channel. Proceeds bidirectionally but faster toward 5' end. Each subunit binds 3 nucleotides. Final: ~300 nm rod, 2130 CP subunits, 16.33 subunits per turn. Key: RNA is essential for nucleation; no empty capsid forms. (2) Poliovirus icosahedral assembly: P1 precursor is cleaved by 3CDpro into VP0, VP3, VP1. 5S protomer: VP0+VP3+VP1. 14S pentamer: five protomers. 75S empty capsid: twelve pentamers assemble without RNA. RNA packaging: (+) ssRNA is inserted into procapsid. Maturation: VP0 autocatalytically cleaved to VP4+VP2 (catalyzed by conserved His and RNA backbone). This stabilizes the capsid enormously. Key: Empty capsid forms first; RNA packaging is separate. (3) Distinction: TMV couples assembly and RNA packaging; poliovirus separates them. This matters for VLP vaccines — poliovirus-like assembly allows icosahedral VLPs without nucleic acid (HPV Gardasil, HBV vaccine).",

      "options": ["During latency, the HSV-1 genome exists as a circular episome in neuronal nuclei with lytic genes silenced by heterochromatin marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3); the only abundant transcript is the latency-associated transcript (LAT), a non-coding RNA that inhibits apoptosis and promotes heterochromatin on lytic promoters; reactivation is triggered by stress signals activating JNK kinase, leading to histone demethylation and derepression of immediate-early genes, especially ICP0 which is a ubiquitin ligase that degrades host repressors like PML bodies", "HSV-1 latency is maintained by continuous low-level replication suppressed by T-cell surveillance", "The viral genome integrates into neuronal chromosomes during latency like a retrovirus", "Latency is maintained by viral DNA methylation that permanently silences the genome"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HSV-1 latency and reactivation: (1) Establishment: After primary mucosal infection, HSV-1 enters sensory nerve terminals and is transported retrograde to ganglia. In neuronal nuclei, linear viral DNA (152 kb) circularizes. Lytic gene expression is silenced. (2) Chromatin silencing: Viral DNA acquires repressive histone marks: H3K9me3 (deposited by SUV39H1/2, recognized by HP1) and H3K27me3 (deposited by PRC2/EZH2). These create heterochromatin on lytic gene promoters. (3) LAT: The only abundant latency transcript. A long non-coding RNA producing a stable 2 kb intron. Functions: anti-apoptotic (inhibits caspases 8 and 9, critical for neuronal survival), encodes viral miRNAs (miR-H2, miR-H6) that target ICP0 and ICP4 mRNAs, and promotes H3K27me3 deposition on lytic genes (analogous to XIST). (4) Reactivation triggers: UV, fever, emotional stress, immunosuppression, nerve injury. These activate JNK/p38 MAPK which activate histone demethylases (JMJD3 for H3K27me3, KDM4 for H3K9me3). Phase I transcription occurs genome-wide at low levels. If sufficient IE expression occurs, ICP0 (RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase) degrades PML nuclear bodies, IFI16, and disperses repressive chromatin. This triggers the full lytic cascade leading to reactivation. (5) Immune surveillance: CD8+ T cells in ganglia suppress reactivation via granzyme B (cleaves ICP4) and IFN-gamma, creating dynamic equilibrium with occasional breakthrough.",

RNA virus mutation rates are ~10^-3 to 10^-5 per nucleotide per replication, compared to ~10^-7 to 10^-9 for DNA viruses. This drives rapid adaptation but limits genome size. S2 TRUE: Reassortment occurs in segmented genome viruses (influenza, rotavirus, bunyaviruses). When two viruses co-infect, genome segments can be randomly assorted into progeny. Historic events: 1957 H2N2, 1968 H3N2, 2009 H1N1 all involved reassortment producing major antigenic shifts. S3 TRUE: RNA recombination occurs through copy-choice template switching — RdRp pauses on one template, transfers to another with the nascent strand still attached, and continues synthesis. Frequent in coronaviruses, picornaviruses, and retroviruses (2-3 crossovers per HIV genome per cycle). HIV circulating recombinant forms represent ~20% of global infections. S4 FALSE: While broadly true, there is overlap. Small ssDNA viruses (parvoviruses, geminiviruses) have mutation rates approaching RNA viruses (~10^-4 to 10^-5) because ssDNA is susceptible to oxidative damage.

M1 bridges RNPs to cytoplasmic tails of glycoproteins. M2 ion channel also incorporated. Budding likely driven by M1 oligomerization curving the membrane. NA cleaves sialic acid to prevent self-aggregation. HIV-1: Gag is myristoylated, targets PI(4,5)P2-rich membrane domains. Gag oligomerizes forming immature particle.

      "explanation": "The white-eyed female is X^w X^w, and the red-eyed male is X^W Y. F1 females are all X^W X^w (carriers, red-eyed), and F1 males are all X^w Y (white-eyed). Crossing F1 females (X^W X^w) with F1 males (X^w Y) gives F2 females: 1/2 X^W X^w (red) and 1/2 X^w X^w (white). Thus 1/2 of F2 females are white-eyed. However, considering the total F2: females are 1/4 carrier red, 1/4 white; males are 1/4 red, 1/4 white. Among all F2 females specifically, 1/2 are white-eyed, which means 1/4 of all F2 are white-eyed females.",

      "explanation": "Morgan's 1910 discovery of a white-eyed male Drosophila and subsequent crosses revealed that the white gene is located on the X chromosome. The key insight was that the inheritance pattern of the white phenotype correlated perfectly with the transmission of the X chromosome. Males, being hemizygous (having only one X), expressed the recessive white allele when they inherited it. This provided the first strong experimental evidence for the chromosome theory of inheritance, linking a specific gene to a specific chromosome and showing how sex-linked traits follow a distinct pattern of inheritance compared to autosomal traits.",

A recombination frequency of 17 cM means that 17% of the offspring from this testcross will be recombinant, and 83% will be parental type. With 1000 progeny, we expect approximately 830 parental types (about 415 of each parental class) and 170 recombinants (about 85 of each recombinant class).

The observed A-C distance is exactly 19%, which means the coefficient of coincidence (c.o.c.) = observed double crossovers / expected double crossovers. Since the observed equals the sum, there appear to be no double crossovers recovered, suggesting positive interference (interference = 1 - c.o.c.).

For a son to be both color blind AND hemophilic, he would need to receive an X chromosome carrying both recessive alleles (X^h-cb). This would require a recombination event between the two loci. With 10% recombination frequency, recombinant gametes make up 10% total (5% each type). The X^h-cb recombinant gamete would be produced at 5% frequency.

This small chromosome was the Y, and the 'missing' large one was the second X. Edmund Wilson made similar observations in other insects. The critical finding was that the heteromorphic chromosome pair segregated during meiosis such that half the sperm carried the X and half carried the Y (or no sex chromosome in X0 systems). This directly linked the chromosomal composition to sex determination, providing cytological evidence for genetic sex determination.

If we assume he is homozygous (Z^B Z^B), and the white female is Z^b W, then F1 males are all Z^B Z^b (brown, heterozygous) and F1 females are all Z^B W (brown). If the brown male were heterozygous (Z^B Z^b), the result would differ.

An XXY fly has 2 X chromosomes and 2 sets of autosomes (assuming normal autosome complement), giving an X:A ratio of 2/2 = 1.0. This ratio of 1.0 produces a female phenotype. In contrast, XY flies have an X:A ratio of 0.5 and develop as males. This system was elucidated by Calvin Bridges through studies of nondisjunction. The Y chromosome in Drosophila carries genes for male fertility but does not determine the male developmental pathway.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "X-inactivation is initiated by the XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) gene, which produces a long non-coding RNA. This RNA physically coats the chromosome from which it is transcribed in cis, spreading along the entire chromosome. XIST RNA then recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing. Additional modifications include DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. In eutherian mammals, X-inactivation is random in somatic cells (either maternal or paternal X can be inactivated), though in marsupials it is always the paternal X.

The gene for orange/black coat color is X-linked, with one allele producing orange pigment and another producing black pigment. A heterozygous female (X^O X^o) undergoes random X-inactivation early in embryonic development. In cells where the X carrying the orange allele is active, orange fur is produced; where the X carrying the black allele is active, black fur results. Since inactivation is clonal (all descendants of a cell maintain the same inactive X), patches of orange and black appear. The white patches in calico cats are due to a separate autosomal gene (spotting gene). This is why calico cats are almost always female\u2014males would need XXY to display this pattern.",

These regions share homology with corresponding regions on the Y chromosome and undergo recombination during male meiosis, behaving like autosomal regions. Since these genes have functional copies on both X and Y chromosomes, they need to be expressed from both X chromosomes in females to maintain proper dosage relative to the two copies in males (one from X, one from Y).

DNA methyltransferases add methyl groups to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides at these DMRs in a sex-specific manner. After fertilization, these methylation marks are maintained by DNMT1 (maintenance methyltransferase) through cell divisions, despite the genome-wide demethylation that occurs in early development. The methylation marks recruit methyl-binding domain proteins, which in turn recruit histone deacetylases and other chromatin-modifying complexes to silence the imprinted allele. Imprinting is essential for normal development, as demonstrated by conditions like Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.",

The maternal copies are silenced by imprinting. Angelman syndrome (AS) results when the deletion is on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, because the UBE3A gene responsible for AS is normally expressed only from the maternal allele in neurons. These are reciprocally imprinted: paternal deletion removes the only active copies of PWS genes, while maternal deletion removes the only active copy of UBE3A.

This means that the observed recombination frequency underestimates the true genetic distance for genes that are far apart. The maximum observable recombination frequency is 50% (indistinguishable from independent assortment), regardless of how far apart the genes actually are.

This contrasts with paracentric inversions where the inverted segment does not include the centromere. S2 is CORRECT: A Robertsonian translocation involves the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes at their centromeres, resulting in one large metacentric chromosome and a small fragment (containing mainly repetitive satellite DNA) that is typically lost. The carrier therefore has 45 chromosomes instead of 46, though they are phenotypically normal because no essential genetic material is lost. S3 is INCORRECT: Duplications are not always lethal.

S2 is CORRECT: In birds (ZW system), males are ZZ and females are ZW. A father (ZZ) transmits one Z to each offspring.

S2 is CORRECT: Human oocytes begin meiosis I during fetal development but arrest at prophase I (dictyotene stage). They remain arrested until ovulation, potentially for decades.

The gene order is determined by comparing the double crossover classes to the parental classes\u2014the allele that has 'switched' identifies the middle gene. A minimum of 1000 progeny ensures statistical reliability and the ability to detect rare double crossover classes. Using a cis-configured female is important because the female is the recombining sex in Drosophila (males show no crossing over). The homozygous recessive male serves as the tester, allowing direct reading of the female's gamete genotypes from the phenotypes of offspring.

Approximately 95% of trisomy 18 conceptuses are spontaneously aborted. Of those born alive, the median survival is 5-15 days, with only about 10% surviving beyond the first year. The prognosis is significantly worse than trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) because chromosome 18 carries a larger number of dosage-sensitive genes.

This differs from Drosophila where X:A = 0.5 produces males and X:A = 1.0 produces females (not hermaphrodites). Under normal laboratory conditions, C. elegans hermaphrodites primarily self-fertilize, and males arise at a frequency of approximately 0.1-0.2% through spontaneous X chromosome nondisjunction. Males can mate with hermaphrodites, providing genetic diversity through outcrossing. The sex determination cascade in C. elegans involves a series of regulatory genes (xol, sdc, her, tra, fem) that transduce the X:A signal into sex-specific developmental programs.

Instead of inactivating one female X chromosome, Drosophila males upregulate transcription from their single X chromosome approximately two-fold. This is achieved by the MSL (male-specific lethal) complex, consisting of five proteins (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE, MOF) and two non-coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2). The MOF component is a histone acetyltransferase that specifically acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac), which opens chromatin structure and enhances transcription. The MSL complex binds to hundreds of sites along the X chromosome in males only, increasing transcriptional output to match that of the two X chromosomes in females. This mechanism was elucidated through the study of male-specific lethal mutations, which are lethal in males (who need compensation) but not in females.",

Three produce viable outcomes: (1) normal 14 + normal 21 (chromosomally normal), (2) rob(14;21) alone (balanced carrier like mother), (3) rob(14;21) + normal 21 (translocation Down syndrome). The other three produce lethal outcomes: monosomy 21, trisomy 14, and monosomy 14. Theoretically, 1/3 of viable offspring would have Down syndrome. However, empirical data shows the actual risk is lower: approximately 10-15% when the mother is the carrier (due to selection against unbalanced gametes during oogenesis and early embryonic loss) and approximately 3-5% when the father is the carrier.

Chromosome doubling (through endoreduplication or failure of mitotic cytokinesis) provides each chromosome with an identical partner for synapsis during meiosis. For example, if species A (2n=14, AA) hybridizes with species B (2n=16, BB), the hybrid is AB (sterile). After chromosome doubling to AABB (amphidiploid), each A chromosome pairs with its A homolog, and each B chromosome pairs with its B homolog. Meiosis proceeds normally, producing balanced AB gametes and restoring fertility.

The other options are genuine features: maternal inheritance (B) is the hallmark pattern; heteroplasmy (C) occurs because cells contain multiple mitochondria, each with multiple genome copies, and mutations can affect some but not all copies; variable expressivity (D) results from random distribution of mutant and normal mitochondria during cell division (mitotic segregation), leading to different tissues having different proportions of mutant mtDNA and correspondingly different severity of symptoms.",

Since the centromere is included in the inversion, the crossover does not produce dicentric or acentric chromosomes. Instead, both recombinant chromosomes retain a single centromere but carry duplications of some segments and deletions of others (unbalanced chromosomes). Specifically, one recombinant chromosome has a duplication of the segment distal to one breakpoint and a deletion of the segment distal to the other breakpoint, and vice versa for the other recombinant chromosome.

All F1 snails are genotypically Dd (heterozygous), but they are phenotypically sinistral because of the maternal cytoplasmic determinants.

The chromosome count and morphology clearly distinguish these. FISH with chromosome 21-specific probes can confirm the number of chromosome 21 copies and identify their locations, even in interphase cells.

The key is that premutation alleles are unstable during maternal meiosis\u2014they tend to expand to full mutations when transmitted from mother to child, with the probability of expansion correlating with repeat number. This means: a woman with a premutation may have unaffected children (if the premutation doesn't expand) or affected children (if it does expand to full mutation). In earlier generations, premutation carriers are unaffected, but in later generations, the expanded full mutations cause disease, giving the appearance of increasing penetrance over generations.",

The difference between sex-linked and sex-limited inheritance is fundamental: sex-linked genes are physically located on sex chromosomes (X or Y), while sex-limited genes are located on autosomes but their expression is restricted to one sex by hormonal or other sex-specific regulatory mechanisms. In Drosophila, many genes involved in male courtship behavior, including components of the courtship song produced by wing vibration, are autosomal but expressed only in males. Their expression is controlled by the sex determination cascade (involving doublesex and fruitless genes) that produces sex-specific transcription factors. Similarly, in mammals, genes for beard growth or breast development are autosomal but sex-limited in expression due to hormonal regulation. Sex-influenced traits are different\u2014they are expressed in both sexes but with different dominance relationships.",

The Philadelphia chromosome creates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Imatinib works by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the ABL kinase domain in its inactive conformation. By occupying the ATP-binding site, imatinib prevents the kinase from phosphorylating its substrates, blocking downstream signaling pathways (including RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and STAT5) that drive cell proliferation and survival. This competitive inhibition is specific enough that it preferentially affects cells expressing BCR-ABL while having relatively modest effects on normal cells. Imatinib does not destroy the Philadelphia chromosome\u2014it persists in cells\u2014but it blocks its oncogenic function. Resistance can develop through point mutations in the ABL kinase domain that alter the imatinib binding site.",

The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is particularly important: it responds to genomic stress, including aneuploidy-induced proteotoxic stress (imbalanced protein production) and DNA damage associated with chromosome missegregation. In cancer cells, p53 and related checkpoint pathways are frequently mutated or inactivated. This allows cancer cells to survive with abnormal chromosome numbers that would trigger apoptosis in normal cells. Additionally, aneuploidy itself can drive cancer evolution through gene dosage effects: gain of chromosomes carrying oncogenes increases oncogene expression, while loss of chromosomes carrying tumor suppressor genes eliminates those growth controls. The resulting chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer that generates genetic diversity within tumors, fueling selection for the most aggressively growing cell populations.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Haplodiploidy creates unusual relatedness coefficients in Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps). Because males are haploid, all sperm from a single male are genetically identical. Full sisters (daughters of the same queen mated with the same drone) therefore share ALL of their paternal genes (r = 0.5 from father's side) plus the usual half of maternal genes (r = 0.25 from mother's side), giving an overall relatedness of r = 0.75 (3/4). This is higher than the relatedness between a mother and her daughters (r = 0.5). W.D. Hamilton proposed that this unusual genetic structure may have favored the evolution of eusociality: worker females may increase their inclusive fitness more by helping raise full sisters (r = 0.75) than by producing their own daughters (r = 0.5). However, this 'haplodiploidy hypothesis' is complicated by the fact that many queens mate with multiple males, and relatedness between half-sisters drops to r = 0.25.

Unlike simple XX/XY or ZW/ZZ systems that inherently produce 1:1 sex ratios, PSD can create a more continuous distribution of 'sex-determining signal strength.' Depending on the number of loci and their individual effects, the sex ratio may deviate from 1:1. Additionally, PSD makes sex determination more sensitive to environmental modulation because environmental factors (temperature, social cues, hormones) can interact with the polygenic threshold. An individual near the threshold between male and female determination might be 'pushed' to one sex by environmental factors. This contrasts with strong genetic sex determination (like mammalian XX/XY with SRY) where environmental factors have little influence.

With maternal UPD, both copies are maternally imprinted (silenced), so there is no expression of these critical genes\u2014phenocopying a paternal deletion. UPD can arise through several mechanisms: trisomy rescue (loss of the paternal chromosome from an initial trisomy 15), monosomy rescue (duplication of the maternal chromosome from an initial monosomy), or gamete complementation.

However, looking more carefully at the arrangement: parental classes suggest cis configuration b+ vg+ cn+ / b vg cn. DCO class b+ vg cn+ has vg switched but cn+ retained, while the other DCO b vg+ cn has vg+ switched with cn. This suggests cn is the middle gene (gene order: b - cn - vg).

      "explanation": "Uniparental disomy can present as heterodisomy (two different homologs from one parent) or isodisomy (two identical copies of one homolog from one parent). Heterodisomy arises primarily through trisomy rescue: (1) Nondisjunction during meiosis I in one parent produces a gamete with both homologs of a particular chromosome (disomic gamete). (2) Fertilization with a normal gamete creates a trisomic zygote. (3) Early mitotic loss of one chromosome 'rescues' the trisomy back to disomy. If the lost chromosome is the one from the other parent, the result is UPD with heterodisomy (two different homologs from the parent with the meiotic error). Isodisomy arises through monosomy rescue (duplication of the single chromosome) or meiosis II nondisjunction (which separates sister chromatids rather than homologs). The distinction matters clinically: heterodisomy preserves heterozygosity and may unmask imprinting effects, while isodisomy can also unmask recessive alleles by creating homozygosity.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "When two genes are far apart on the same chromosome, the observed recombination frequency between them is less than the sum of the individual intervals because double crossovers (one crossover in each interval) restore the parental configuration of the outermost markers. For white-miniature (36.1 cM) and miniature-forked (3.0 cM), the sum is 39.1 cM. However, some proportion of offspring will have experienced crossovers in BOTH intervals simultaneously. These double crossover individuals appear as parental types for the white-forked combination, reducing the apparent recombination frequency below 39.1 cM. The Haldane mapping function can estimate the expected recombination frequency: for distances this large, the actual recombination frequency approaches 50% asymptotically. The 36.1 cM distance is already large enough that double crossovers significantly reduce the observed white-forked recombination. This is why genetic map distances are additive for short intervals but not for long ones, and why three-point crosses are more informative than two-point crosses.",

In the case of 46,X,r(X), one X chromosome has lost material from both its short arm and long arm ends, with the remaining segment circularizing. Ring chromosomes present several problems during cell division: (1) they can be lost during mitosis due to difficulty passing through the spindle, (2) crossing over between sister chromatids of a ring chromosome produces a double-sized dicentric ring that cannot segregate properly, leading to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. This results in mosaicism, with some cells having the ring, some having lost it (45,X), and some having modified derivatives.

The mechanism involves MHM (Male Hypermethylated) region, a non-coding RNA locus on the Z chromosome that accumulates on one Z in males but its role in compensation is debated. DMRT1, a Z-linked gene present in two copies in males but one in females, plays a critical role in sex determination\u2014its dosage appears to be the primary sex-determining signal in birds.

A woman with 30% monosomic (45,X) cells and 70% normal (46,XX) cells would generally have a milder phenotype than a non-mosaic 45,X individual for several reasons: (1) The 46,XX cells provide normal dosage of genes that escape X-inactivation, partially compensating for haploinsufficiency in the 45,X cells. (2) If the ovaries contain a sufficient proportion of 46,XX cells, some ovarian function may be maintained, potentially allowing menstruation and even fertility (though with reduced ovarian reserve). (3) The SHOX gene, a major determinant of stature, is expressed from both X chromosomes; having 70% of cells with two active SHOX copies may result in near-normal height.

When two species hybridize, the F1 hybrid contains one haploid set of chromosomes from each parent species. These homeologous chromosomes are too different to pair properly during meiosis, resulting in unbalanced gametes and sterility. Colchicine treatment inhibits spindle formation during mitosis, causing chromosome doubling. The resulting amphidiploid has two copies of each parental chromosome set. Now, during meiosis, each chromosome has a homologous partner from the same species: the two copies of species A chromosomes pair with each other, and the two copies of species B chromosomes pair with each other. This allows normal bivalent formation, proper segregation, and production of balanced gametes, restoring fertility. This process was demonstrated experimentally by Karpechenko (1928) with radish \u00d7 cabbage and by Blakeslee and colleagues using colchicine.

The XIC contains the XIST gene and its antisense regulator TSIX, along with other regulatory elements that control the choice and initiation of inactivation. S3 is CORRECT: Once established during early development, X-inactivation is maintained clonally through cell divisions.

      "explanation": "This parent-of-origin effect on penetrance strongly suggests genomic imprinting. In classic imprinting, one parental allele is completely silenced. However, imprinting can also be partial or incomplete, where the silenced allele retains some residual expression. In this case, the maternal allele appears to be partially imprinted: when a mouse inherits the gene from its father, the paternal allele is fully expressed (100% penetrance). When inherited from the mother, the maternal allele is partially silenced by epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation at differentially methylated regions, repressive histone modifications), resulting in reduced expression that only reaches the threshold for the phenotype in 30% of individuals. This is consistent with known imprinted genes that show variable levels of silencing rather than all-or-nothing imprinting. The autosomal location rules out X-linkage.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Chromothripsis (from Greek: chromos = chromosome, thripsis = shattering) was first described in 2011 by Stephens et al. It involves the catastrophic shattering of one or a few chromosomes (or chromosomal regions) into tens to hundreds of fragments in a single event, followed by random reassembly by DNA repair mechanisms (primarily non-homologous end joining, NHEJ). This produces massive genomic rearrangements\u2014deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations\u2014concentrated on the affected chromosome(s). Evidence for chromothripsis includes: (1) rearrangements clustered on one or few chromosomes rather than distributed genome-wide; (2) oscillation between two copy number states (present or deleted); (3) random orientation of rejoined fragments. Chromothripsis may occur when chromosomes are trapped in micronuclei during mitosis, where they undergo defective DNA replication and fragmentation. It is found in approximately 2-3% of all cancers and is particularly common in certain tumor types (osteosarcoma, glioblastoma).",

      "options": [
        "Tetraploid (4n), because the diploid genome doubles upon fertilization",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "When a tetraploid (4n) parent is crossed with a diploid (2n) parent, the gametes are 2n (from the tetraploid) and n (from the diploid). The F1 offspring will be 2n + n = 3n, which is triploid. Triploid organisms are largely sterile because during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair as bivalents. With three copies of each chromosome, one chromosome will form a bivalent with one partner, leaving the third as a univalent. Univalents segregate randomly to either pole, leading to unbalanced gametes with variable chromosome numbers (aneuploid gametes). The probability of producing a balanced gamete (with either n or 2n chromosomes of each type) is extremely low: (1/2)^x where x is the haploid chromosome number. For a species with x = 7 (like wheat), only 1 in 128 gametes would be balanced by chance. This sterility is exploited commercially: seedless watermelons are triploid, produced by crossing tetraploid and diploid parents.",

To test this directly requires experimental manipulation in a model organism. The optimal approach uses conditional knockout mouse models where the cohesin subunit REC8 (or SMC1beta) can be depleted at specific times. By comparing oocytes from young mice, aged mice, and aged mice with artificially maintained cohesin levels, the researcher can directly test whether cohesin loss causes the age-related increase in aneuploidy. Chromosome spreads from oocytes at metaphase I or II, combined with FISH using chromosome-specific probes, quantify the rate of premature sister chromatid separation and chromosome missegregation. This approach has been successfully used\u2014studies by Jessberger and others have shown that cohesin levels decrease with maternal age and that reduced cohesin correlates with increased nondisjunction.",

The 46,XX/46,XY chimera contains cell populations that are genetically male and genetically female, originating from two separate fertilization events. The most common mechanism is the fusion of two dizygotic (fraternal) twin embryos at the morula or early blastocyst stage, before implantation. The resulting individual develops as a single organism containing a mosaic of cells from both original embryos. This is fundamentally different from mosaicism (where different cell lines arise from a single zygote through postzygotic events like nondisjunction or mutation). Chimerism can also arise from: (1) blood cell transfer between dizygotic twins through placental anastomoses (blood chimerism); (2) fertilization of an egg and its polar body by different sperm (tetragametic chimera); (3) maternal-fetal cell transfer during pregnancy (microchimerism). 46,XX/46,XY chimeras may present with ambiguous genitalia, ovotesticular disorder of sex development, or as apparently normal males or females depending on the distribution of XX and XY cells.",

However, this is only an average\u2014local rates vary enormously. S2 is CORRECT: Recombination does not occur uniformly along chromosomes. Recombination hotspots are localized regions (typically 1-2 kb) where crossover frequency is 10-1000 times higher than the genome average. These hotspots are often determined by the PRDM9 protein in humans, which binds specific DNA motifs and promotes recombination. The existence of hotspots means that genetic distances between nearby genes can vary dramatically. S3 is CORRECT: Centromeric regions and pericentromeric heterochromatin show significantly reduced recombination rates, likely due to the condensed chromatin structure and the need to maintain centromere function. S4 is INCORRECT: Due to factors in S2 and S3, the relationship between genetic and physical distance is NOT constant.

When he passed it to his daughters, the imprint was reset\u2014in his daughters' germline, the allele received a maternal imprint (silencing mark). However, when the daughters transmit this allele to their sons, the sons inherit it as a maternally-derived allele, so it remains silenced by the maternal imprint.

An XYY fly has one X chromosome and two sets of autosomes, giving an X:A ratio of 0.5, which specifies male development. The extra Y chromosome does not change this ratio and therefore does not affect sex determination. This is fundamentally different from mammalian sex determination, where the Y chromosome carries the SRY gene that actively directs male development. In Drosophila, the Y chromosome carries genes for male fertility (specifically, genes needed for sperm production) but does not determine the male developmental pathway. Calvin Bridges demonstrated this through his studies of flies with various combinations of X chromosomes, Y chromosomes, and autosome sets. Flies with X:A = 1.0 are female, X:A = 0.5 are male, and intermediate ratios produce intersex phenotypes.

Genes that are far apart on the same chromosome (greater than approximately 50 cM apart) will show a recombination frequency approaching 50%, which produces the same 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio as independent assortment. This is because multiple crossovers between distant loci effectively randomize the allele combinations. To distinguish between true independent assortment and distant linkage, additional experiments are needed: (1) test for linkage with intermediate genes that bridge the gap, (2) use cytogenetic methods like FISH to determine chromosomal locations, or (3) in organisms where it's possible, use deletion mapping to assign genes to specific chromosomes. In practice, genetic mapping defines linkage groups, but assigning linkage groups to specific chromosomes requires additional cytogenetic evidence.

Genes within the same TAD often share regulatory elements (enhancers, silencers, insulators) and are subject to similar chromatin environments, leading to coordinated expression. TAD boundaries are defined by CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) binding sites and cohesin complexes that form loop domains. This organization means that chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, inversions, deletions) that disrupt TAD boundaries can cause genes to come under the influence of inappropriate regulatory elements, a mechanism known as 'enhancer adoption' or 'regulatory mutation.'

However, the extent of spreading varies stochastically between cells during development, creating a variegated (mosaic) phenotype. The classic example is the white gene: normally located in euchromatin on the X chromosome, if translocated next to heterochromatin, some cells express white (producing red ommatidia) and others have it silenced (producing white ommatidia), creating a mosaic eye. PEV is modified by suppressors [Su(var)] and enhancers [E(var)] of variegation. Many Su(var) genes encode heterochromatin components (like HP1/Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-9 histone methyltransferase).

The observation of 11 bivalents indicates 2n = 23 in males (22 autosomes + 1 X) and 2n = 24 in females (22 autosomes + 2 X). Edmund Wilson's early studies on this system contributed to understanding the chromosomal basis of sex determination.",

As an X-linked recessive trait, males (XY) who inherit one mutant allele are affected, while females require two mutant alleles (extremely rare). Carrier females (heterozygous) usually have sufficient factor VIII from their normal allele. S2: Red-green color blindness results from mutations/deletions in the OPN1LW (red) and OPN1MW (green) opsin genes on Xq28. It affects approximately 8% of males of Northern European descent, making it one of the most common X-linked conditions. S3: Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in MECP2 on Xq28. It is X-linked dominant\u2014heterozygous females are affected (with variable severity due to X-inactivation mosaicism). Males with MECP2 mutations typically have severe neonatal encephalopathy and die in infancy, so the condition is almost exclusively diagnosed in females. S4: Hypertrichosis pinnae (excessive hair growth on the ear pinna) was long cited in genetics textbooks as a Y-linked trait, but subsequent studies have questioned this, showing autosomal or more complex inheritance patterns in many families.",

      "explanation": "Gene conversion is a non-reciprocal transfer of genetic information during meiotic recombination. In a heterozygote (A/a), normal meiosis produces four products with a 2A:2a ratio. However, gene conversion can alter this to 3A:1a or 1A:3a (or rarely 4:0 ratios). Gene conversion occurs during the repair of heteroduplex DNA formed during recombination. When a mismatch repair system corrects the A/a heteroduplex, it may convert one allele to match the other, changing the allele ratio in the meiotic products. Gene conversion was first detected in fungi (Neurospora, yeast) through tetrad analysis, where all four products of a single meiosis can be recovered. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gene conversion events can be detected at the molecular level by analyzing the inheritance of polymorphisms flanking the gene of interest. Gene conversion is an important mechanism for the evolution of multigene families and for the concerted evolution of tandemly repeated sequences.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In Neurospora crassa (and other organisms amenable to ordered tetrad analysis), the arrangement of spores in the ascus reflects the events of meiosis. First-division segregation (FDS) patterns (4:4 arrangement, e.g., ++++mmmm) indicate that the gene segregated from its allele at meiosis I, meaning no crossover occurred between the gene and the centromere. Second-division segregation (SDS) patterns (2:2:2:2 arrangements, e.g., ++mm++mm or +m+m+m+m) indicate that a crossover occurred between the gene and the centromere, causing the alleles to segregate only at meiosis II. The gene-to-centromere distance equals half the frequency of SDS asci. The reason for dividing by 2 is that a single crossover between the gene and centromere involves only 2 of the 4 chromatids, so only half the chromatids in a crossover meiosis are actually recombinant. With 40% SDS asci, the distance = 40/2 = 20 cM. This elegant analysis is only possible in organisms where the products of individual meioses can be recovered in order.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes from an ancestral pair of autosomes has occurred independently multiple times across the tree of life. As the Y (or W) chromosome degenerates through processes like Muller's ratchet, suppression of recombination, and accumulation of deleterious mutations, a dosage imbalance develops for genes on the non-degenerated X (or Z) chromosome. Different lineages have independently evolved different solutions: mammals evolved X-inactivation (one X silenced in XX individuals), Drosophila evolved hypertranscription (single male X upregulated 2-fold), C. elegans evolved partial repression (both hermaphrodite X chromosomes downregulated by half), and birds evolved incomplete gene-by-gene compensation. These different mechanisms represent convergent evolution\u2014independent solutions to the same fundamental problem of gene dosage imbalance. The fact that the mechanisms differ so fundamentally supports independent origin rather than common ancestry, consistent with the independent evolution of sex chromosomes in these lineages from different ancestral autosomes.",

      "explanation": "In humans, genetic mapping cannot use controlled crosses. Instead, linkage analysis relies on studying families (pedigrees) where both markers (gene loci) are segregating. The LOD (logarithm of odds) score method, developed by Newton Morton, compares the likelihood of the observed pedigree data under two hypotheses: (1) the genes are linked with a specific recombination frequency (theta), versus (2) the genes are unlinked (theta = 0.5). The LOD score is calculated as: LOD = log10[L(theta) / L(0.5)]. A LOD score greater than or equal to 3.0 is considered evidence for linkage (odds of 1000:1), while less than or equal to -2.0 excludes linkage at that distance. The recombination frequency is estimated as the value of theta that maximizes the LOD score (maximum likelihood estimate). This approach requires analyzing multiple informative meioses across families. Modern genomic approaches use genome-wide SNP arrays and statistical methods, but the fundamental principle remains the same: track the co-inheritance of markers through families to estimate recombination frequency.",

      "explanation": "The Haldane mapping function corrects for multiple crossovers that restore parental configurations and are therefore undetected. The formula is: d = -1/2 \u00d7 ln(1 - 2r), where r is the observed recombination frequency and d is the corrected map distance in Morgans. For r = 0.20: d = -1/2 \u00d7 ln(1 - 2(0.20)) = -1/2 \u00d7 ln(0.60) = -1/2 \u00d7 (-0.5108) = 0.2554 Morgans = 25.54 cM. The corrected distance (25.54 cM) is larger than the observed 20 cM because some double crossovers occurred but were undetected (they restored the parental arrangement of markers). Haldane's function assumes no crossover interference (each crossover is independent of others). The Kosambi mapping function provides an alternative correction that accounts for positive interference: d = 1/4 \u00d7 ln[(1+2r)/(1-2r)]. For r = 0.20, Kosambi gives approximately 22.3 cM, which is less than Haldane's estimate because interference reduces the frequency of double crossovers below the no-interference expectation.",

The short arms of these acrocentric chromosomes contain arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes encoding the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal RNAs, organized as nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). Since the short arms contain mainly repetitive rDNA sequences with no unique essential genes, Robertsonian translocations\u2014which involve fusion at or near the centromeres with loss of the short arms\u2014do not result in significant loss of unique genetic material. This is why balanced Robertsonian translocation carriers (45 chromosomes) are phenotypically normal.

      "explanation": "Recurrent CNVs occur at specific genomic hotspots because they are generated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), also called unequal crossing over, between flanking segmental duplications (also known as low-copy repeats or LCRs). These segmental duplications share high sequence identity (typically >95%) and can be several kilobases to hundreds of kilobases in length. During meiosis (or occasionally mitosis), the recombination machinery can mistakenly align and recombine between paralogous copies on the same chromosome (intrachromosomal) or on homologous chromosomes (interchromosomal). If the flanking duplications are in direct orientation, NAHR produces one chromosome with a deletion and a reciprocal chromosome with a duplication. The 22q11.2 region (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome), 7q11.23 (Williams syndrome), and 17p11.2 (Smith-Magenis syndrome) are classic examples of NAHR-mediated recurrent deletion/duplication syndromes, each flanked by characteristic segmental duplications that predispose to these rearrangements.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The risk calculation involves two independent probabilities: (1) the probability that the mother transmits her premutation X chromosome (50%, since she has one premutation X and one normal X), and (2) the probability that the premutation expands to a full mutation (>200 repeats) during maternal meiosis. For a premutation with 95 CGG repeats, the expansion risk is very high—studies show approximately 80-100% probability of expansion to full mutation when the premutation has >90 repeats. Combining these: 50% × ~90% ≈ ~45%, approximately 50% overall given the near-certainty of expansion at this repeat length. For a son who inherits the premutation X, expansion to full mutation causes hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene, resulting in absence of FMRP protein and the full Fragile X phenotype. Importantly, premutation alleles are unstable ONLY during maternal transmission—paternal transmission rarely causes expansion because the premutation alleles are selected against during spermatogenesis or the repeat contracts.",

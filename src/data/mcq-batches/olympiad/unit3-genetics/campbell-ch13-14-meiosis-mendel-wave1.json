      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "During meiosis I, the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit Rec8 (which replaces Scc1/Rad21 of mitotic cohesin) must be protected at centromeres by Shugoshin (Sgo1) recruiting PP2A. This phosphatase counteracts the phosphorylation of centromeric Rec8, preventing its cleavage by separase. Arm cohesin (Rec8 along chromosome arms) is phosphorylated and cleaved at anaphase I, allowing homolog separation, while centromeric Rec8 is preserved until anaphase II.",

Cytogenetic analysis reveals that one chromosome is a Robertsonian translocation product involving two acrocentric chromosomes. What is the phenotypic consequence of this karyotype?",
      "options": [
        "The individual is trisomic for both chromosomes involved in the translocation and is expected to be severely affected",
        "The individual is a balanced carrier with a normal phenotype despite having 9 chromosomes, because no genetic material is gained or lost",
        "The individual is monosomic for the short arms of the two acrocentric chromosomes and will show haploinsufficiency",
        "The individual has 9 chromosomes but carries a complete diploid genome because the translocation fused two chromosomes; the individual is phenotypically normal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "A Robertsonian translocation fuses two acrocentric chromosomes at their centromeres, producing one large metacentric chromosome and a small fragment (containing satellite DNA/rDNA repeats from the short arms, which is typically lost). An individual with 2n - 1 = 9 chromosomes but carrying the Robertsonian translocation chromosome has a complete euploid set of genetic information on the long arms. Since the lost short-arm material is repetitive (rDNA genes present in hundreds of copies on other chromosomes), the individual is phenotypically normal. This differs from a simple monosomic, which would be missing an entire chromosome's worth of unique genes.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the Holliday model, the junction can be resolved in two orientations. Cutting the crossing strands (the strands originally involved in strand exchange) produces non-crossover recombinants — the flanking markers remain in their parental configuration, though gene conversion in the heteroduplex region may still occur. Cutting the non-crossing strands produces crossover recombinants with reciprocal exchange of flanking markers. This distinction is critical for understanding why not all recombination events lead to crossovers and explains the observed ratio of crossover to non-crossover products in meiosis.",

      "explanation": "A 15:1 ratio arises from duplicate gene interaction (also called duplicate dominant epistasis). Here, a dominant allele at either locus A or locus B (or both) produces the same phenotype. Only the double recessive (aabb, 1/16) shows the alternative phenotype.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The expected female genotypes from this cross are X^+X^+ and X^+X^y, both of which should be wild-type (since yellow is recessive). A yellow-bodied female most likely arose from a deletion on the paternal X^+ chromosome encompassing the yellow locus, making her functionally hemizygous (X^Δ X^y), so only the maternal X^y allele is expressed. Option A (skewed X-inactivation) would produce mosaic patches, not uniform yellow. Option B (mitotic nondisjunction) would produce mosaicism.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "For each trivalent (group of three homologous chromosomes), segregation at anaphase I produces a 2:1 split. For a given trivalent, the probability that one specific pole receives exactly one chromosome (rather than two) is 1/2 for each pole. To produce a balanced n = 7 gamete, each of the 7 trivalents must send exactly one chromosome to the same pole. The probability for each trivalent contributing exactly one chromosome to a specific gamete is 1/2. Since the 7 trivalents segregate independently, the probability is (1/2)^7 = 1/128.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Bombay phenotype (Oh) results from homozygosity for a non-functional allele (h/h) at the FUT1 (H) locus on chromosome 19. The H gene encodes a fucosyltransferase that adds fucose to create the H antigen, which is the precursor substrate for the A and B transferases. Without H antigen, neither A nor B antigens can be expressed, regardless of the ABO genotype. The child could be I^A i or I^B i (from the AB father and O mother) but phenotypes as O because he/she is h/h. Both parents must carry the h allele (H/h).

Coefficient of coincidence = 5/20 = 0.25. Interference = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.

It forms a covalent intermediate with the 5' DNA ends via a tyrosine residue, similar to topoisomerase II. These covalently bound Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes are then removed by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex. S2: TRUE — Dmc1 is a meiosis-specific RecA/Rad51 homolog that is essential for interhomolog strand invasion during meiotic recombination. Rad51 operates in both mitotic (DNA repair) and meiotic contexts. Both work cooperatively during meiosis. S3: FALSE — In most organisms studied (especially S. cerevisiae and mice), DSBs are formed BEFORE full synapsis. In fact, DSBs and the early steps of recombination are required for proper synapsis. The sequence is: DSB formation → strand invasion → synapsis initiation → full synaptonemal complex assembly. This is a critical distinction from the old model. S4: TRUE — The ZMM pathway (named for Zip1-4, Msh4-5, Mer3, and Spo16) promotes class I crossovers that exhibit interference. These crossovers are evenly distributed along chromosomes, ensuring each bivalent receives at least one crossover (the obligate crossover).

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Meiosis I nondisjunction means homologs fail to separate: both daughter cells are abnormal (one with an extra chromosome, one missing it). After meiosis II, this yields two disomic and two nullisomic gametes. Meiosis II nondisjunction affects only one of the two secondary cells: sister chromatids fail to separate in one cell, producing one disomic and one nullisomic gamete, while the other cell divides normally producing two euploid gametes. S2: TRUE — Trisomy rescue (loss of one chromosome from a trisomic cell) can produce UPD if the two remaining copies both came from the same parent. If the chromosome is subject to imprinting (e.g., chromosome 15), this can cause Prader-Willi syndrome (maternal UPD15) or Angelman syndrome (paternal UPD15). S3: FALSE — The extra X in Klinefelter syndrome can originate from either parent. Approximately 50% of cases result from paternal nondisjunction (father produces an XY sperm) and 50% from maternal nondisjunction (mother produces an XX egg). The parental origin can be determined using polymorphic DNA markers.

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The wrinkled phenotype in pea seeds is indeed caused by an ~800 bp insertion of a transposable element in the SBE1 gene (starch-branching enzyme I). This disrupts amylopectin synthesis, leading to higher free sucrose, greater water uptake, and subsequent wrinkling upon desiccation. This was demonstrated by Bhatt et al. (1998). S2: FALSE — Although peas have 7 chromosome pairs, Mendel's seven traits do NOT map to seven different chromosomes. Some traits are on the same chromosome. For example, seed color (I) and flower color (A) are both on chromosome 1, and plant height (Le) and pod shape (V/v) are both on chromosome 4. They still showed independent assortment either because they are far enough apart (>50 cM) to appear unlinked or because Mendel did not perform simultaneous trihybrid crosses that would have revealed linkage. S3: TRUE — The green cotyledon color in pea results from a recessive allele at the SGR (STAY-GREEN) locus. The dominant I allele encodes a functional SGR protein that promotes chlorophyll degradation during maturation, turning cotyledons yellow. The recessive i allele produces a nonfunctional protein, so chlorophyll is retained and seeds remain green. S4: TRUE — R.A. Fisher's 1936 analysis concluded that Mendel's data were suspiciously close to expected ratios. Fisher's chi-square analysis gave a combined P-value of about 0.00004 (far less than 5%), suggesting the data were 'too good to be true.' This has been debated extensively — possible explanations include unconscious bias, confirmation bias in scoring ambiguous phenotypes, or an assistant who knew the expected results.",

      "explanation": "S1: FALSE — A 13:3 ratio is NOT complementary gene interaction. It is inhibitory (or suppressor) epistasis. In a 13:3 ratio, the 9 A_B_ + 3 aaB_ + 1 aabb classes share one phenotype (13), while only the 3 A_bb class shows a different phenotype. This differs fundamentally from complementary interaction (9:7), where both genes must have at least one dominant allele to produce the phenotype. In 13:3, the dominant allele at one locus (B) suppresses the phenotypic expression of the other locus. S2: TRUE — The complementation test (cis-trans test) is fundamental to defining genes operationally. Two recessive mutations complement (produce wild-type F1 in trans configuration) if they are in different genes, because each parent supplies a functional copy of the other's mutant gene. If mutations are in the same gene, no wild-type allele is provided for that gene, and the F1 is mutant. This defines complementation groups = genes. S3: TRUE — In the 9:7 (complementary interaction), dominant alleles at BOTH loci are needed to produce the phenotype (only A_B_ = 9/16 shows it); any homozygous recessive at either locus blocks the pathway. In 15:1 (duplicate dominant), a dominant allele at EITHER locus suffices (A_B_ + A_bb + aaB_ = 15/16), and only the double recessive aabb (1/16) shows the alternative phenotype. S4: TRUE — In recessive epistasis (9:3:4), the 4 class represents the epistatic locus in homozygous recessive condition (aaB_ + aabb = 3 + 1 = 4) masking the hypostatic locus. This typically reflects a biosynthetic pathway where the epistatic gene product acts upstream. For example, in Labrador coat color, the ee genotype prevents any pigment deposition regardless of the B/b genotype, because the E gene product is needed earlier in the melanin deposition pathway.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The bouquet configuration is a conserved feature of early meiotic prophase. Telomeres attach to the inner nuclear membrane and cluster at one pole, driven by cytoplasmic motors via SUN-domain (inner membrane) and KASH-domain (outer membrane) proteins forming the LINC complex. This arrangement brings homologous chromosomes into proximity, facilitating pairing and synapsis. S2: TRUE — The obligate chiasma (at least one crossover per chromosome pair) is essential for proper meiotic segregation. It creates physical linkage between homologs that, combined with sister chromatid arm cohesion, provides the tension needed for proper bipolar attachment at metaphase I. Non-exchange chromosomes (those lacking a crossover) are at high risk of nondisjunction. S3: TRUE — After the synaptonemal complex disassembles during the diplotene stage, chiasmata are the only physical connections maintaining bivalent integrity. They represent the cytological manifestation of crossovers and are stabilized by residual arm cohesion distal to the crossover point. This is why they are visible as cross-shaped structures and why they terminalize (slide toward chromosome ends) as condensation proceeds. S4: TRUE — Drosophila males completely lack meiotic recombination (achiasmate meiosis). Non-exchange chromosomes segregate via a distributive system where heterologous chromosomes can pair and segregate based on size similarity rather than sequence homology. This backup system also operates for non-exchange chromosomes in Drosophila females. The molecular basis involves heterochromatin-mediated associations.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Autosomal recessive traits classically skip generations. Two unaffected carriers (Aa x Aa) produce 1/4 affected (aa) offspring on average. Both sexes are equally likely to be affected. The trait may appear to arise 'out of nowhere' when both parents are heterozygous carriers. S2: TRUE — The definitive feature distinguishing X-linked recessive from autosomal recessive is the absence of male-to-male (father-to-son) transmission. An affected father (X^a Y) passes his X chromosome to all daughters (making them carriers) and his Y to all sons. Therefore, an affected father cannot produce an affected son unless the mother is also a carrier. S3: TRUE — Pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) at the tips of X and Y chromosomes undergo obligate crossover during male meiosis. Genes in these regions (e.g., SHOX) are inherited in a pattern indistinguishable from autosomal inheritance, including father-to-son transmission, because recombination can transfer alleles between X and Y. S4: FALSE — With complete penetrance, autosomal dominant traits CANNOT skip generations. Every individual carrying even one copy of the dominant allele expresses the phenotype. Therefore, affected individuals always have at least one affected parent, and the trait appears in every generation (vertical transmission). It is specifically INCOMPLETE penetrance that allows dominant traits to skip generations (a carrier has the allele but does not express the phenotype). This is a fundamental distinction from autosomal recessive inheritance, where generation-skipping is the norm due to heterozygous carriers.",

For humans (n = 23), this is 2^23 = 8,388,608 possible gamete types from one parent, considering only whole-chromosome combinations without crossing over. When crossing over is included, the actual number of genetically distinct gametes is essentially unlimited. S2: FALSE — Genes located more than 50 cM apart on the same chromosome DO exhibit 50% recombination frequency, which is identical to the frequency expected for genes on different chromosomes. Multiple crossovers between very distant loci effectively randomize the allelic combinations. Such genes are genetically unlinked despite being physically linked, and they DO assort independently for all practical purposes. The claim that physical linkage always produces parental excess is incorrect for genes >50 cM apart. S3: TRUE — At 30 cM distance, the recombination frequency is 30%. This means 30% of gametes are recombinant types and 70% are parental types. If the genes assorted independently, we would expect 50% parental and 50% recombinant. The deviation from 50:50 (the excess of parental types) is the hallmark of linkage, violating the prediction of independent assortment. S4: TRUE — Mendel's second law is a consequence of chromosomal behavior during meiosis I, specifically the random orientation of bivalents at metaphase I. It applies strictly only to unlinked genes. Mendel happened to study traits that were either on different chromosomes or far enough apart on the same chromosome to appear unlinked. The chromosome theory (Boveri-Sutton) provided the physical explanation for Mendel's laws.",

The single molecular change causes hemoglobin polymerization under low oxygen, leading to sickle-shaped RBCs. This single cause cascades into multiple organ systems: hemolytic anemia (RBC destruction), splenomegaly (splenic sequestration), vaso-occlusive pain crises, stroke risk, renal damage, and in heterozygotes (HbAS), relative protection against severe P. falciparum malaria. S2: TRUE — Polygenic traits display continuous (quantitative) variation. For skin color, at least 4-6 major loci (including SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, MC1R) contribute additively. Each 'dose' of a contributing allele adds incrementally to melanin production. Environmental factors (UV exposure) further modulate the phenotype, creating a smooth bell-shaped distribution in populations. S3: FALSE — Pleiotropy and polygenic inheritance are NOT the same concept. They are reciprocal (complementary) concepts: pleiotropy is one gene affecting MANY traits, while polygenic inheritance is MANY genes affecting one trait. The statement incorrectly claims both describe multiple genes interacting for a single phenotype — that is only the definition of polygenic inheritance. Pleiotropy is the opposite: a single gene with multiple phenotypic effects. While a trait can exhibit both phenomena simultaneously (e.g., coat color genes are pleiotropic AND coat color has polygenic modifiers), the two concepts are fundamentally distinct. S4: TRUE — In an additive polygenic model with n loci, each with two alleles contributing equally, and no dominance, the F2 has (2n + 1) phenotypic classes. With 1 locus: 3 classes (0, 1, 2 contributing alleles). With 2 loci: 5 classes (0-4 contributing alleles). With 3 loci: 7 classes.

      "explanation": "Step 1 — Identify parentals and double crossovers: Parentals (most frequent) are y+ ct+ v+ (410) and y ct v (395). Double crossovers (least frequent) are y+ ct v+ (3) and y ct+ v (3). Step 2 — Determine gene order: Compare DCO classes to parentals. In the DCO class y+ ct v+, compared to parental y+ ct+ v+, only the ct allele has changed. This means ct is the middle gene (it is the one that switches in double crossovers). Gene order: y — ct — v. Step 3 — Calculate map distances: y-ct distance = (SCO between y and ct + DCO) / total = (48 + 52 + 3 + 3)/1000 = 106/1000 = 10.6 cM. ct-v distance = (SCO between ct and v + DCO) / total = (42 + 47 + 3 + 3)/1000 = 95/1000 = 9.5 cM. Step 4 — Interference: Expected DCO = 0.106 x 0.095 x 1000 = 10.07. Observed DCO = 6. c.o.c. = 6/10.07 = 0.596. Interference = 1 - 0.596 = 0.404 (approximately 0.40). Positive interference indicates that a crossover in one interval reduces the probability of a crossover in the adjacent interval.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The complementation test (also called the cis-trans test or functional allelism test) is the gold standard for determining whether mutations are in the same or different genes. The experimental design is straightforward and efficient: Cross 1: curl-3/curl-3 females x curl-1/curl-1 males → F1 females are curl-3/curl-1. If curly wings (mutant phenotype): curl-3 and curl-1 FAIL to complement, meaning they are in the same gene (same complementation group). Neither allele can produce a functional protein. If wild-type wings: curl-3 and curl-1 DO complement, meaning they are in different genes. Each mutation is covered by the wild-type allele from the other parent. Since curl-1 and curl-2 are already known to be in the same gene, testing curl-3 against curl-1 alone would suffice, but testing against both provides confirmation. This approach is superior to the alternatives because: Option B (sequencing) requires knowing the exact gene and is expensive; Option C (mapping) takes multiple generations and is indirect; Option D (deficiency mapping) is useful but requires specialized deletion stocks and is less direct than complementation testing.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Option C provides the most comprehensive experimental design that systematically tests and distinguishes all four hypotheses. Step 1 — Reciprocal crosses (Tt x tt and tt x Tt): The provided data already show 1:1 ratios in both directions. This rules out gametic lethality (if T pollen or T ovules were lethal, one reciprocal would give only dwarf offspring) and certation (differential pollen tube growth would affect ratios only when both T and t pollen compete on the same stigma, i.e., during selfing, not in crosses with tt). Step 2 — Embryo examination: Self Tt plants and examine developing seeds at sequential time points (7, 14, 21 days post-pollination). If TT is embryo-lethal, approximately 25% of seeds should show arrested/aborted embryos. The timing of arrest reveals when TT lethality occurs (early embryogenesis vs. seed maturation). Empty seed coats or shriveled seeds at a consistent developmental stage would confirm embryo lethality. Step 3 — Genotyping survivors: If all tall F2 plants from selfing are heterozygous Tt (none are TT), this provides molecular confirmation that TT is lethal. Using PCR markers or sequencing to distinguish TT from Tt is definitive. Step 4 — The reduced fruit set (75% of normal) is consistent with 25% embryo abortion (TT lethality), as the plant may abort fruits with too many dead seeds. This multi-pronged approach is superior to Option A (incomplete — doesn't rule out all alternatives), Option B (technically difficult — single pollen grain genotyping is challenging), and Option D (unnecessary genetic engineering — the question can be answered with classical genetics).",

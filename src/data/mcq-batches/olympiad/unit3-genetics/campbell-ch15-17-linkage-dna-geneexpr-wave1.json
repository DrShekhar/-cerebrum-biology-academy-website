      "question": "In Drosophila, genes for body color (b) and wing shape (vg) are located on chromosome 2, approximately 17 cM apart. A female heterozygous in cis configuration (b+ vg+ / b vg) is test-crossed. Among 1000 progeny, the expected number of recombinant offspring (b+ vg and b vg+) is approximately 170. However, the researcher observes that recombination frequency in males of this species is zero. What is the molecular basis for this absence of recombination in Drosophila males?",
      "options": [
        "Males lack the synaptonemal complex entirely during meiosis, so homologous chromosomes cannot pair and undergo crossing over",
        "Males express a dominant suppressor of recombination encoded on the fourth chromosome that inhibits DSB formation genome-wide",
        "The Y chromosome in Drosophila males actively suppresses recombination on all autosomes through a trans-acting heterochromatin spreading mechanism",
        "Males produce functional Spo11 protein but lack the MutS-homolog (MSH4/MSH5) components of the ZMM pathway, preventing formation of class I crossovers, and the achiasmate segregation system ensures proper disjunction without chiasmata"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Drosophila males undergo achiasmate meiosis — they completely lack meiotic recombination. The molecular basis involves the absence of key crossover-promoting factors rather than the absence of synapsis itself. Males do form synaptonemal complex-like structures but lack functional ZMM pathway components (MSH4, MSH5, and related factors) that promote class I interfering crossovers. Spo11-dependent DSBs are either not formed or are channeled exclusively into non-crossover repair. Proper chromosome segregation is maintained through an alternative achiasmate segregation system involving heterochromatin-mediated associations and the distributive segregation pathway. Option A is incorrect because males do form pairing structures. Options B and C describe non-existent mechanisms.",

      "question": "A woman who is a carrier for hemophilia A (X^H X^h) has a son with hemophilia and a daughter who is also a carrier. The daughter's cells are examined by fluorescence microscopy after Barr body staining. In what percentage of her somatic cells would you expect the X chromosome carrying the hemophilia allele (X^h) to be inactivated, and what is the role of XIST RNA in this process?",
      "options": [
        "100% of cells will inactivate X^h because XIST preferentially targets mutant X chromosomes for silencing",
        "Approximately 50% of cells will inactivate X^h, because X-inactivation is random; XIST RNA is a long non-coding RNA transcribed from the X-inactivation center (XIC) that coats the future inactive X in cis, recruiting PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) to tri-methylate H3K27 and establish heterochromatin",
        "0% of cells inactivate X^h because the cell selectively retains the normal allele on the active X through a quality-control mechanism during lyonization",
        "Approximately 50% of cells will inactivate X^h; XIST RNA functions as a trans-acting small interfering RNA that degrades mRNA from the inactive X chromosome"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "X-inactivation (lyonization) is a random process occurring early in female embryonic development (~day 5.5 in mice, ~day 12 in humans). Each cell independently and randomly inactivates one X chromosome. XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) is a ~17 kb long non-coding RNA transcribed from the XIC on the chromosome destined for inactivation. XIST RNA coats the future inactive X in cis (not trans), recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes including PRC2 (which catalyzes H3K27me3) and SMRT/HDAC1 (which deacetylates histones). This cascade establishes facultative heterochromatin. The process is random with respect to which X carries a mutation, so approximately 50% of cells will silence the X^h chromosome. Option A is wrong because inactivation is not mutation-directed. Option C describes a mechanism that does not exist. Option D incorrectly describes XIST as an siRNA with trans-acting function.",

      "question": "Genomic imprinting at the Igf2/H19 locus in mice involves differential methylation of an imprinting control region (ICR). On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR binds the insulator protein CTCF, which blocks the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter, so only H19 is expressed. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. What is the consequence of methylating the paternal ICR?",
      "options": [
        "Methylation of the paternal ICR prevents CTCF binding, allowing downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 transcription; methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 on the paternal allele",
        "Methylation of the paternal ICR directly activates Igf2 transcription by recruiting transcriptional activators to the Igf2 promoter",
        "Methylation of the paternal ICR causes the entire paternal chromosome to be inactivated, similar to X-inactivation",
        "Methylation of the paternal ICR blocks enhancer access to both Igf2 and H19, silencing both genes on the paternal allele"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "At the Igf2/H19 imprinted locus, the ICR acts as a methylation-sensitive insulator. On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR binds the zinc-finger insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), which creates a chromatin boundary that prevents downstream enhancers from reaching the Igf2 promoter; instead, the enhancers activate H19. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation of the ICR (established during spermatogenesis by DNMT3A/DNMT3L) prevents CTCF binding. Without the insulator boundary, the enhancers can now loop to and activate the Igf2 promoter. Additionally, methylation spreads from the ICR to the H19 promoter region, silencing H19 on the paternal allele. The net result is monoallelic expression: Igf2 from the paternal allele only, H19 from the maternal allele only. This is a classic example of the enhancer competition/insulator model of imprinting.",

The bacteria were then transferred to 14N (light) medium and allowed to replicate. After two rounds of replication in 14N medium, what proportion of DNA molecules would be entirely light (14N-14N) versus hybrid (15N-14N) when analyzed by CsCl density gradient centrifugation?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Meselson-Stahl experiment demonstrated semiconservative replication. Starting with one fully heavy (15N-15N) molecule: After round 1 in 14N medium: 2 molecules, both hybrid (15N-14N). Each original heavy strand serves as a template and is paired with a newly synthesized light strand. After round 2 in 14N medium: 4 molecules total. The two hybrid molecules each replicate: the 15N strand produces one hybrid (15N-14N) molecule and one light (14N-14N) molecule; the 14N strand from round 1 produces two light (14N-14N) molecules. Wait — each hybrid molecule produces one hybrid and one light molecule. So from 2 hybrid molecules: 2 hybrid + 2 light = 4 total molecules. That gives 50% hybrid and 50% light. After n rounds of replication from one original molecule, there are 2^n total molecules, of which exactly 2 are hybrid (each containing one of the two original 15N strands) and (2^n - 2) are light. For n = 2: 2 hybrid out of 4 total = 50%.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The correct sequence of events during lagging strand synthesis in E. coli is: (1) DnaB helicase (not DnaA, which is the initiator protein) unwinds the parental double helix, moving 5'→3' on the lagging strand template. (2) SSB (single-strand binding) proteins coat the exposed single-stranded DNA to prevent reannealing and nuclease degradation. (3) DnaG primase, recruited by DnaB, synthesizes short RNA primers (~10-12 nucleotides) complementary to the template. (4) The gamma (γ) complex clamp loader, in an ATP-dependent process, opens and loads the beta (β) sliding clamp (a ring-shaped homodimer) onto the primed template. (5) DNA Pol III core enzyme associates with the β clamp and extends the RNA primer, synthesizing an ~1000-2000 nt Okazaki fragment until it reaches the previous primer. (6) DNA Pol I uses its unique 5'→3' exonuclease activity (nick translation) to remove the RNA primer while simultaneously filling the gap with DNA. (7) DNA ligase catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation to seal the remaining nick. Option A incorrectly has Pol III synthesizing RNA primers and SSB loading the beta clamp. Option B incorrectly has DnaA unwinding and Pol I extending. Option D has topoisomerase unwinding and describes DNA primers with incorrect exonuclease directionality.",

      "question": "Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that solves the end-replication problem. In human somatic cells that lack telomerase activity, telomeres shorten by approximately 50-200 bp per cell division. A researcher isolates cells from a patient with dyskeratosis congenita, which has mutations in dyskerin (DKC1), a component of the telomerase RNP complex. Which of the following best describes dyskerin's role and the molecular consequence of its mutation?",
      "options": [
        "Dyskerin is the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase; its mutation abolishes telomere extension, causing premature telomere shortening and stem cell failure",

        "Dyskerin is a shelterin component that protects telomeres from being recognized as double-strand breaks; its mutation triggers DNA damage response at telomeres without affecting telomerase activity",
        "Dyskerin is a pseudouridine synthase that modifies the telomerase RNA component (TERC/hTR), stabilizing its H/ACA box structure; DKC1 mutations reduce TERC levels, lowering telomerase activity and accelerating telomere attrition in stem cells"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Dyskerin (encoded by DKC1 on the X chromosome) is a pseudouridine synthase that is an essential component of H/ACA-class small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs). The telomerase RNA component (TERC/hTR) contains an H/ACA domain at its 3' end, and dyskerin binds this domain, stabilizing the RNA. Dyskerin is NOT the catalytic subunit (that is TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase) nor the RNA template (that is TERC). Mutations in DKC1 destabilize TERC, reducing its steady-state levels, which in turn reduces assembled telomerase holoenzyme activity. This leads to progressive telomere shortening, particularly devastating in high-turnover tissues (bone marrow, skin, gut epithelium), manifesting as the clinical triad of dyskeratosis congenita: abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, with bone marrow failure being the major cause of mortality. Option C incorrectly describes dyskerin as a shelterin protein (shelterin components include TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, and RAP1).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) at a Pol II promoter follows a stepwise pathway: (1) TFIID binds first. Its TBP (TATA-binding protein) subunit recognizes the TATA box (consensus TATAAA, located ~25-30 bp upstream of the TSS) by inserting a beta-sheet into the MINOR groove (not major groove — this is a critical distinction), inducing a sharp ~80-degree bend in the DNA that serves as a platform for subsequent factor assembly. (2) TFIIA stabilizes the TBP-DNA complex. TFIIB binds next, contacting both TBP and DNA sequences upstream (BRE) and downstream of the TATA box; TFIIB serves as a bridge to recruit Pol II. (3) TFIIF (a heterodimer of RAP30/RAP74) escorts Pol II to the promoter and helps stabilize the complex. (4) TFIIE joins and recruits TFIIH. (5) TFIIH is a multi-subunit complex with two key enzymatic activities: its XPB (ERCC3) subunit has 3'→5' helicase/translocase activity that melts ~11-15 bp of DNA at the start site (forming the transcription bubble), and its CDK7 subunit phosphorylates Ser-5 of the Pol II CTD heptad repeats during promoter escape. Option A incorrectly says major groove and names a wrong helicase (DDB1). Option B has the order wrong and claims phosphorylation precedes melting. Option D mislocates TFIID recruitment and confuses CDK7 kinase with helicase activity.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inosine (I) is a modified base commonly found at the wobble position (5' end) of tRNA anticodons, produced by deamination of adenosine by the enzyme ADAT (adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA). According to Crick's wobble rules, inosine can form hydrogen bonds with three different bases at the third position (3' end) of the codon: U (two hydrogen bonds), C (two hydrogen bonds, similar to standard I:C Watson-Crick-like pair), and A (two hydrogen bonds). Thus, a tRNA with anticodon 5'-IAU-3' pairs with codons in antiparallel fashion: the 3' U of the anticodon pairs with the 5' A of the codon, the middle A pairs with U, and the 5' I (wobble position) pairs with U, C, or A at the third codon position. This gives codons 5'-AUU-3', 5'-AUC-3', and 5'-AUA-3' — all encoding isoleucine. Inosine does NOT pair with G, so AUG (methionine) is not recognized, ruling out option D. This is why a single tRNA with an inosine wobble base can decode three out of four codons in a codon family box, maximizing decoding efficiency with minimal tRNA species. Option B incorrectly limits I to A pairing only. Option C incorrectly limits I to U and C pairing (which describes G wobble pairing, not I wobble).",

(2) SRP binding slows or arrests translation (translation arrest). (3) The SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex diffuses to the ER membrane, where SRP binds its receptor (SR, composed of SRα and SRβ subunits). Both SRP and SR are GTPases. (4) In a GTP-dependent handoff, the ribosome-nascent chain complex is transferred to the Sec61 translocon (a heterotrimeric channel composed of Sec61α, β, γ). GTP hydrolysis by both SRP and SRα drives the release of SRP for recycling.

The ABL1 proto-oncogene from chromosome 9q34 is fused to the BCR gene on chromosome 22q11.2, creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (210 kDa in CML, 190 kDa in ALL) that drives uncontrolled proliferation. Imatinib (Gleevec) specifically inhibits this fusion kinase. S2: TRUE — PEV is the classic example of position effect. When a chromosomal rearrangement (typically an inversion) places a normally euchromatic gene near constitutive heterochromatin, the heterochromatin can spread across the breakpoint in a stochastic, cell-variable manner. The spreading involves H3K9 methylation by Su(var)3-9 (a HMT) and binding of HP1 (encoded by Su(var)2-5). Cells where heterochromatin spreads over the gene silence it; cells where spreading stops before the gene express it normally, producing a variegated (mosaic) phenotype. S3: FALSE — Cri-du-chat syndrome results from a DELETION (not duplication) of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p deletion syndrome, monosomy 5p). The characteristic cat-like cry is attributed to haploinsufficiency of genes in the 5p15.2-5p15.3 region, particularly loss of CTNND2 and other genes. S4: TRUE — A pericentric inversion includes the centromere (breakpoints on both arms), so the relative position of the centromere within the inverted segment changes, potentially altering the arm ratio. A paracentric inversion has both breakpoints on the same arm and does not include the centromere, so arm ratio is unchanged.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Although X-inactivation silences most genes on one X chromosome in mammalian females, approximately 15% of human X-linked genes escape inactivation (with up to 10% showing variable escape between individuals). Many escape genes are concentrated in the pseudoautosomal regions (which have Y-chromosome homologs and thus require biallelic expression) and in evolutionary strata that were more recently added to the X chromosome. This incomplete inactivation contributes to phenotypic differences between XX and X0 (Turner syndrome) individuals. S2: TRUE — Drosophila uses hypertranscription of the single male X. The MSL complex (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, MLE, plus roX1/roX2 non-coding RNAs) binds the male X chromosome. MOF (males absent on the first) is a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates H4K16, loosening chromatin structure and upregulating transcription approximately 2-fold from the male X to match the combined output of two female X chromosomes. S3: TRUE — C. elegans uses the opposite strategy: the dosage compensation complex (DCC) in XX hermaphrodites reduces transcription from each X chromosome by half. The DCC includes condensin-like subunits (DPY-26, DPY-27, DPY-28, CAPG-1, MIX-1) recruited by SDC proteins, which modify chromatin structure to dampen transcription. S4: TRUE — The feline orange gene (O) is X-linked. Heterozygous females (X^O X^o) undergo random X-inactivation, producing mosaic patches of orange and black fur. Larger patches indicate earlier inactivation (fewer cells at the time, so each clone expands into a larger territory). The white patches in calico cats are separately determined by the autosomal spotting (S) gene.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — In E. coli, Dam methylase methylates the adenine in GATC sequences. Immediately after replication, the parental strand is fully methylated but the new strand is temporarily unmethylated (hemimethylated state). The MutS protein recognizes the mismatch, MutL mediates signaling, and MutH specifically cleaves the unmethylated (new) strand at a nearby GATC site. The segment containing the mismatch is excised (by UvrD helicase and exonucleases), resynthesized by Pol III, and sealed by ligase. In eukaryotes, strand discrimination uses a different mechanism involving PCNA orientation and strand breaks at replication forks. S2: TRUE — NER recognizes and repairs bulky, helix-distorting lesions (UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, benzo[a]pyrene adducts, cisplatin crosslinks). In E. coli: UvrA2B complex detects the lesion, UvrB confirms the damage, and UvrC makes incisions on both sides of the lesion (8 nt 5' and 4-5 nt 3'), excising a ~12-13 nt fragment. In eukaryotes: the process involves XPC-RAD23B for damage recognition (in global genome NER), TFIIH (XPB and XPD helicases) for unwinding, XPG cuts 3' and ERCC1-XPF cuts 5', excising a ~24-32 nt fragment. S3: TRUE — The epsilon (ε) subunit of DNA Pol III provides 3'→5' exonuclease proofreading activity. When a mismatched base is incorporated, the polymerase stalls, the 3' end of the nascent strand transfers to the exonuclease active site, the mismatched nucleotide is removed, and the correct nucleotide is then inserted. This improves fidelity ~100-fold (from ~10^-5 base substitution rate of the polymerase alone to ~10^-7 with proofreading). S4: TRUE — Deamination of cytosine to uracil is one of the most common spontaneous DNA lesions (~100-500 per cell per day in humans). Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) specifically recognizes and cleaves the glycosidic bond between uracil and deoxyribose, creating an AP site. AP endonuclease (APE1 in humans) then cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the AP site. In short-patch BER, Pol β fills the single-nucleotide gap, and DNA ligase III/XRCC1 seals the nick.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Division of labor at the eukaryotic replication fork assigns Pol ε to the leading strand and Pol δ to the lagging strand. Both polymerases have 3'→5' proofreading exonuclease activity and require the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) sliding clamp, a homotrimer that encircles DNA and increases processivity. PCNA is loaded by the RFC (replication factor C) clamp loader complex in an ATP-dependent reaction. Pol α-primase initiates both leading and lagging strand synthesis with a short RNA-DNA primer that is then extended by Pol ε or Pol δ respectively. S2: TRUE — Origin licensing is a key cell cycle control mechanism. During G1, the ORC (origin recognition complex) bound at origins recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1, which facilitate loading of MCM2-7 hexamers. Two MCM hexamers are loaded per origin as an inactive double hexamer encircling double-stranded DNA. At the G1/S transition, S-CDK (Clb5/6-Cdc28 in yeast) and DDK (Dbf4-Cdc7) phosphorylate MCM subunits and accessory factors (Sld2, Sld3), triggering recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to form the active CMG helicase. CDK activity simultaneously prevents new MCM loading (by phosphorylating Cdc6 for degradation and inhibiting Cdt1), ensuring each origin fires only once per cell cycle. S3: TRUE — The human genome contains approximately 30,000-50,000 potential replication origins, but origin firing is stochastic — only about 10% are activated in a typical S phase. Dormant origins serve as backups: if a replication fork stalls or collapses, nearby dormant origins can fire to ensure the region is replicated (a safeguard mechanism). The total number of active origins is sufficient to replicate the ~6.4 billion bp genome within the ~8-hour S phase. S4: TRUE — Eukaryotic Okazaki fragments are ~100-200 nt, much shorter than prokaryotic fragments (~1,000-2,000 nt). The shorter length correlates with the nucleosomal spacing (~200 bp per nucleosome, including linker DNA). The presence of nucleosomes ahead of the replication fork, which must be disassembled and reassembled, likely constrains the priming interval and thus the fragment length. Histone chaperones (CAF-1, ASF1, FACT) coordinate nucleosome dynamics with replication fork progression.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The 5' cap is one of the earliest co-transcriptional modifications. Three enzymatic activities are involved: (1) RNA triphosphatase removes the terminal phosphate from the 5' end of the pre-mRNA; (2) guanylyltransferase adds a GMP in a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage; (3) methyltransferase adds a methyl group at the N-7 position of guanine. The capping enzyme complex is recruited to the Ser-5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA Pol II during early elongation, when the transcript is ~20-30 nt long. The cap protects mRNA from exonucleases, promotes translation initiation (recognized by eIF4E), and facilitates nuclear export. S2: TRUE — The Dscam gene (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) is a remarkable example of alternative splicing. It contains four clusters of alternatively spliced exons: exon 4 (12 variants), exon 6 (48 variants), exon 9 (33 variants), and exon 17 (2 variants). Combinatorial inclusion of one variant from each cluster yields 12 x 48 x 33 x 2 = 38,016 possible isoforms. The Drosophila genome contains approximately 14,000 genes, so this single gene can produce nearly 3 times more protein variants than the total gene count. S3: TRUE — The hexanucleotide signal AAUAAA (and the less common AUUAAA) is located 10-30 nt upstream of the polyadenylation/cleavage site. CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) binds AAUAAA, while CstF (cleavage stimulation factor) binds a GU-rich or U-rich downstream element. After endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly(A) site, PAP (poly(A) polymerase) adds ~250 adenosines (in mammals) without a template. PABPN1 (nuclear poly(A)-binding protein) stimulates processive polyadenylation and controls tail length. S4: TRUE — SR proteins and hnRNP proteins represent antagonistic regulators of alternative splicing. SR proteins (e.g., SRSF1/ASF/SF2, SRSF2/SC35) bind ESEs through their RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and promote U2AF and U1 snRNP recruitment to nearby splice sites via their RS (arginine-serine) domains, favoring exon inclusion. Conversely, hnRNP proteins (e.g., hnRNP A1, hnRNP I/PTB) bind silencer elements and can block splice site recognition, promote exon skipping, or redirect splicing to alternative sites. The relative concentrations of these antagonistic factors in different cell types drive tissue-specific splicing patterns.",

The Nobel Prize-winning work of Steitz, Ramakrishnan, and Yonath (2009) confirmed that the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) is composed entirely of 23S rRNA — no protein is within 18 angstroms of the catalytic site. The ribosome is thus a ribozyme, with the rRNA performing catalysis and the proteins serving primarily structural roles. S2: TRUE — The EF-Tu-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex delivers charged tRNAs to the ribosomal A site. Initial codon-anticodon recognition triggers a conformational change in the 30S subunit (domain closure) that activates the GTPase center of EF-Tu. GTP hydrolysis causes a conformational change in EF-Tu that releases it from the aminoacyl-tRNA (in EF-Tu-GDP form), allowing the acceptor end of the tRNA to swing into the PTC for peptide bond formation (accommodation). This GTP-dependent proofreading step improves codon-reading accuracy. EF-Ts then regenerates EF-Tu-GTP. S3: TRUE — Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze a two-step reaction. Step 1 (activation): amino acid + ATP → aminoacyl-AMP + PPi (the amino acid is adenylated). Step 2 (transfer): aminoacyl-AMP + tRNA → aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP (the amino acid is transferred to the 2'-OH or 3'-OH of the 3'-terminal adenosine A76 of the tRNA). The PPi produced in step 1 is hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPi → 2Pi), making the overall reaction irreversible. Thus, the equivalent of 2 ATP→AMP+2Pi (i.e., 2 high-energy bonds) are consumed per amino acid charged. S4: TRUE — Translocation is catalyzed by EF-G (eEF2 in eukaryotes), a GTPase that structurally mimics the EF-Tu-tRNA complex. EF-G-GTP binds the ribosome, and GTP hydrolysis drives a ratchet-like conformational change that moves the mRNA-tRNA complex exactly one codon (3 nt) in the 5'→3' direction. This shifts the peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site, the deacylated tRNA from the P site to the E site (from which it dissociates), and positions the next codon in the now-empty A site for the next round of elongation.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — In a three-point cross, double crossovers require simultaneous crossover events in both intervals, which is inherently less probable than either single crossover alone. The key to determining gene order is: compare the DCO class to the parental class; the allele that has switched positions in the DCO relative to the parentals identifies the middle gene. This works because a double crossover flanking the middle gene restores the outer markers to parental configuration while switching the middle gene's allele. S2: TRUE — The coefficient of coincidence quantifies the degree to which crossovers in adjacent intervals are independent. c.o.c. = (observed DCO frequency) / (expected DCO frequency), where expected DCO = (frequency of CO in interval 1) x (frequency of CO in interval 2). Interference I = 1 - c.o.c. When I > 0 (positive interference), crossovers are spaced further apart than expected (one crossover inhibits nearby crossovers). When I = 0, crossovers are independent. Negative interference (I < 0) is rare in meiotic recombination but occurs in some phage systems. S3: TRUE — Because of multiple crossovers, the maximum detectable recombination frequency between two linked genes approaches 50% as physical distance increases. At ~55 cM, so many double crossovers restore the parental arrangement that the observed recombination frequency plateaus near 50%, mimicking independent assortment. These genes are said to be 'syntenic but unlinked' in practical terms. However, if a third gene maps between them, the two shorter intervals each show <50% recombination, proving linkage across the entire segment. This is additive mapping. S4: TRUE — In Neurospora ordered tetrad (octad) analysis, first-division segregation (FDS) produces a 4:4 pattern of spore genotypes (e.g., 4 mutant:4 wild-type in a specific arrangement), meaning no crossover occurred between the gene and the centromere. Second-division segregation (SDS) produces mixed patterns (2:2:2:2 or 2:4:2 arrangements), indicating a crossover between the gene and the centromere. The map distance = (frequency of SDS asci) / 2, because only half the chromatids in each SDS ascus are recombinant. Thus SDS frequency = 2 x map distance.",

S2: TRUE — LHON (OMIM #535000) is the most common mitochondrial disease, caused primarily by three mtDNA point mutations: m.11778G>A (ND4), m.3460G>A (ND1), and m.14484T>C (ND6) — all in Complex I subunit genes. Heteroplasmy (the coexistence of mutant and wild-type mtDNA within cells) explains the variable penetrance and expressivity: the proportion of mutant mtDNA must exceed a tissue-specific threshold (~60-80% for retinal ganglion cells) before disease manifests. The stochastic segregation of mitochondria during cell division (replicative segregation/genetic drift) can shift heteroplasmy ratios between generations and between tissues. S3: FALSE — This statement contains two errors. First, chloroplast DNA inheritance is NOT strictly maternal in all plant species. While most angiosperms show maternal inheritance (e.g., Arabidopsis, maize), some species show biparental (e.g., Pelargonium/geranium, Medicago) or even paternal (e.g., most gymnosperms like conifers) plastid inheritance. Second, while CMS is indeed maternally inherited (encoded by mitochondrial genes, not chloroplast), it CAN be restored by nuclear restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes. Rf genes encode pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that suppress the expression of the mitochondrial CMS-causing gene. The Rf system is the basis of hybrid seed production in many crop species. S4: TRUE — bicoid is a classic maternal effect gene (not to be confused with maternal inheritance of organelle DNA). The bicoid gene is nuclear, located on chromosome 3 of Drosophila. The mother's genotype determines the early embryonic phenotype. During oogenesis, bicoid mRNA is transcribed, transported, and anchored at the anterior pole of the oocyte by the 3' UTR localization signal and associated factors (staufen, exuperantia, swallow). After fertilization, Bicoid protein (a homeodomain transcription factor) is translated and diffuses posteriorly, forming a concentration gradient. At high concentrations, Bicoid activates hunchback transcription and represses caudal translation, establishing anterior identity. This is maternal effect because the mother's nuclear genotype determines the phenotype of the offspring embryo, but the gene itself is chromosomal, not organellar.",

Double crossovers (least frequent) are b+ cn vg (3) and b cn+ vg+ (2). Step 2 — Determine gene order: Compare DCO to parental classes. Parental: b+ cn+ vg+. DCO: b+ cn vg. The allele that switches is cn (from cn+ to cn), while b+ and vg+ remain b+ but vg changes to vg. Wait — let me re-examine. Parental is b+ cn+ vg+. DCO is b+ cn vg. So cn switched from + to mutant, and vg also switched. Actually for the other pair: Parental b cn vg, DCO b cn+ vg+. Here cn switched from mutant to +, and vg switched from mutant to +. The gene that switched in both DCO classes relative to both parental classes is cn (looking at only the middle change). More precisely: in DCO b+ cn vg, compared to parental b+ cn+ vg+, both cn and vg changed. But comparing DCO b cn+ vg+ to parental b cn vg, both cn and vg also changed. The middle gene is the one that appears to have exchanged in both DCO classes — this is cn when the order is b-cn-vg. A double crossover flanking cn would flip cn relative to the parentals.

Evidence from the PTB knockdown experiment: (1) Reducing PTB in neurons shifts the ratio from 92% CGRP toward calcitonin (60% calcitonin, 40% CGRP), directly demonstrating that PTB is required for CGRP mRNA production by suppressing exon 4 processing. (2) The shift is incomplete (not 95% calcitonin as in thyroid), indicating that additional neuron-specific factors (such as SRp20 and other RNA-binding proteins) cooperate with PTB to fully repress exon 4.

This rate is consistent with the expected 50-200 bp loss per division due to the end-replication problem (the inability of DNA polymerase to completely replicate the 3' end of linear chromosomes) plus oxidative damage processing. Senescence is triggered when telomeres shorten to a critical length (~5 kb in this dataset). At this point, telomeres can no longer form the protective t-loop/shelterin cap, exposed chromosome ends activate the ATM/ATR-p53-p21 DNA damage response pathway, triggering irreversible G1 arrest (replicative senescence, also called the Hayflick limit). hTERT-expressing cells: Introduction of hTERT (the catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase) reconstitutes active telomerase in the fibroblasts (which normally express TERC but not TERT). The telomeres elongate, but the rate of net elongation decreases as telomeres get longer: 70 bp/passage (passages 25-35), 35 bp/passage (35-55), 30 bp/passage (55-75). This deceleration is consistent with the protein counting model: longer telomeres bind more shelterin complexes (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, RAP1), particularly TRF1, which acts as a negative regulator of telomere length by inhibiting telomerase access. As telomeres lengthen, more TRF1 accumulates, progressively restricting telomerase processivity, establishing a homeostatic set point. Option B incorrectly calculates the rate and denies regulation. Option C misidentifies the mechanism as ALT (which involves recombination-based telomere maintenance and is telomerase-independent).

If they reacquire the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) before reaching the main AUG, they reinitiate translation.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The three-point cross (Option C) is the most efficient strategy for simultaneously determining gene order, map distances between all pairs of genes, and interference. Step 1 — Construct the triple heterozygous female: Cross sw/sw females to w m / Y double mutant males (the w m stock may need to be constructed first by crossing w/Y males to m/m females, selecting w m recombinant males, or using appropriate crosses). The F1 females will be w+ sw m+ / + w + sw + m (in trans for the known markers). Alternatively, cross in steps: sw/sw females x w/Y males → F1 sw +/+ w females; then cross these to m/Y males in appropriate scheme to get triple heterozygotes. Step 2 — Test cross: Cross the triply heterozygous females to w sw m / Y males (triple mutant males, which need to be constructed). All male offspring are hemizygous and directly reveal the maternal X genotype. Step 3 — Score all eight phenotypic classes among male progeny: identify parental, single crossover (two intervals), and double crossover classes. Step 4 — Analysis: the least frequent class (DCO) reveals gene order (the gene whose allele switches in DCO vs. parentals is the middle gene). Calculate both map distances and interference. Option A only confirms recessivity (already known). Option B gives two-point distances but misses gene order and interference. Option D is technically possible but unnecessarily complex for a mapping question. The three-point cross is the classical, most efficient genetic mapping approach.",

      "question": "A molecular biology research group wants to determine whether a newly discovered DNA repair enzyme in their organism uses a proofreading mechanism (3'→5' exonuclease), mismatch repair, or nucleotide excision repair to correct errors. They have purified the enzyme and have access to synthetic DNA substrates, radiolabeled nucleotides, and standard biochemistry equipment. Design a set of experiments to distinguish between these three repair mechanisms.",
      "experimentContext": "The group has purified a novel DNA repair protein (NovR) from a thermophilic bacterium. Preliminary data show that deletion of the novR gene increases the spontaneous mutation rate 50-fold. They have: (1) purified recombinant NovR protein, (2) synthetic oligonucleotide substrates (matched, mismatched, and bulky-lesion-containing duplexes), (3) radiolabeled (32P) nucleotides and substrates, (4) ATP, GTP, divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+), (5) gel electrophoresis equipment for resolving DNA fragments, (6) exonuclease-dead mutant of NovR (NovR-D145A, predicted catalytic aspartate mutant). The goal is to distinguish: (A) 3'→5' exonuclease proofreading — would degrade DNA from the 3' end, preferentially releasing mismatched terminal nucleotides; (B) mismatch repair endonuclease — would nick the DNA strand containing the mismatch at a site away from the mismatch; (C) NER-type activity — would excise an oligonucleotide fragment spanning the lesion.",
      "options": [
        "Simply sequence the novR gene and compare it to known repair enzyme databases. If it has homology to MutS, it is mismatch repair; if homologous to UvrA, it is NER; if homologous to DnaQ, it is proofreading.",
        "Incubate NovR with a 3'-end-labeled duplex DNA containing a terminal mismatch (G:T at the 3' end) and monitor for release of the labeled terminal nucleotide by thin-layer chromatography. If NovR is a 3'→5' exonuclease, it will preferentially release the mismatched nucleotide. Then test with an internally mismatched substrate (mismatch 20 bp from both ends): if NovR nicks the strand (detected by denaturing gel), it may be a mismatch repair endonuclease like MutH. Finally, test with a substrate containing a thymine dimer at a defined position: if NovR excises an oligonucleotide fragment (detected as a ~12-13 nt labeled fragment on a gel), it has NER activity. Use the NovR-D145A mutant as a negative control to confirm catalytic dependence.",
        "Measure the mutation rate of the novR deletion strain in combination with known repair pathway mutants. If novR deletion is epistatic with mutS deletion (no further increase), NovR acts in the same pathway as mismatch repair.",
        "Perform a crystal structure determination of NovR to identify the active site architecture. Alpha-helical and zinc-finger motifs indicate NER; beta-sheet-rich structures indicate exonuclease activity."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B presents a comprehensive biochemical approach that directly tests each mechanism using the purified protein and appropriate substrates. Experiment 1 — Test for 3'→5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity: Use a duplex DNA substrate with a 32P-labeled 3' terminal mismatched nucleotide (e.g., a G:T mismatch at the 3' end of one strand). Incubate with NovR and Mg2+. Resolve products by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or denaturing PAGE. If NovR has 3'→5' exonuclease activity, it will preferentially release the mismatched 3' nucleotide (detected as a free labeled nucleotide on TLC). Compare the rate of release from mismatched vs. matched termini — a proofreading exonuclease shows strong preference for mismatched ends. Experiment 2 — Test for mismatch repair endonuclease activity: Use a circular or long linear duplex with an internal G:T mismatch (far from the ends to exclude exonuclease activity). If NovR is a mismatch-dependent endonuclease (like MutH in E. coli), it will introduce a nick in one strand near or at a specific sequence (e.g., hemimethylated GATC). Detect nicking by running the substrate on a denaturing agarose gel — nicked substrates will migrate as linear single strands. Include a hemimethylated vs. fully methylated substrate to test strand discrimination. Experiment 3 — Test for NER activity: Use a duplex DNA containing a site-specific thymine dimer (UV-induced or chemically synthesized). If NovR has NER-type activity, it will excise an oligonucleotide fragment spanning the lesion. In E. coli NER, this fragment is ~12-13 nt. Detect the excised fragment by denaturing PAGE of internally 32P-labeled substrates. Controls: (1) NovR-D145A catalytic mutant should be inactive in all assays, confirming enzymatic activity depends on the predicted active site. (2) Matched substrates (no lesion, no mismatch) serve as negative controls. (3) Known enzymes (if available) serve as positive controls. Option A (bioinformatics) is a useful starting point but does not experimentally determine function, especially for a novel enzyme that may not have close homologs. Option C (genetic epistasis) is valuable but only determines pathway membership, not mechanism. Option D (structural biology) is informative but takes months and does not directly test activity. Option B provides definitive biochemical evidence within days.",

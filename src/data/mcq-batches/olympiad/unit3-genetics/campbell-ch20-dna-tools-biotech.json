      "question": "A researcher wants to clone a 3.5 kb human gene into a plasmid vector. After restriction digestion of both the insert and vector with EcoRI, the researcher notices low cloning efficiency. What is the most likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Self-ligation of the linearized vector is more likely than insert ligation, as vector ends are compatible",
        "EcoRI produces blunt ends that are inefficient for ligation",
        "The 3.5 kb insert is too large for any plasmid vector",
        "EcoRI does not cut human DNA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "When both vector and insert are cut with the same restriction enzyme (EcoRI, which produces 5'-AATT-3' sticky ends), vector self-ligation (re-circularization without insert) competes with insert-vector ligation. Since self-ligation is an intramolecular reaction favored at low DNA concentrations, it often dominates over the bimolecular insert-vector ligation. Solutions include: (1) dephosphorylating the vector with alkaline phosphatase (prevents self-ligation), (2) using two different restriction enzymes for directional cloning (incompatible ends prevent self-ligation), or (3) blue-white screening to identify recombinant clones. EcoRI produces 4-base 5' sticky ends, not blunt ends.",

        "To synthesize new DNA strands",
        "To anneal primers to the template",
        "To separate the double-stranded DNA template into single strands"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The denaturation step (typically 94-98°C for 15-30 seconds) disrupts the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, separating the double-stranded DNA template into two single strands. This exposes the template sequences so primers can bind (anneal) during the subsequent lower-temperature step. Taq polymerase (from Thermus aquaticus) is already active and thermostable; the denaturation step does not activate it. Annealing occurs at 50-65°C, and extension (DNA synthesis) occurs at 72°C—the optimal temperature for Taq polymerase.",

      "options": [
        "The 20-nucleotide spacer sequence in the gRNA that is complementary to the target DNA, adjacent to a PAM sequence",

        "Random binding of Cas9 to any double-stranded DNA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "CRISPR-Cas9 targeting specificity is determined by two elements: (1) the 20-nucleotide spacer sequence in the guide RNA (gRNA) that base-pairs with the complementary target DNA strand, and (2) the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, typically 5'-NGG-3' for SpCas9) immediately downstream of the target site on the non-target strand. The Cas9 protein first recognizes the PAM, then checks for complementarity between the gRNA and the adjacent DNA. Mismatches in the 'seed region' (8-12 nt proximal to the PAM) are least tolerated. Off-target cutting can occur at sites with partial gRNA complementarity, which is a major concern for therapeutic applications.",

        "They are toxic to DNA polymerase, causing it to dissociate",
        "They cause the DNA template to denature",

        "They lack a 3'-OH group, preventing formation of the phosphodiester bond with the next incoming nucleotide"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Dideoxynucleotides (2',3'-dideoxynucleotides, ddNTPs) lack the 3'-hydroxyl group that is essential for forming the 3'-5' phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide. When DNA polymerase incorporates a ddNTP instead of the normal dNTP, the growing chain cannot be extended further because there is no 3'-OH to attack the 5' phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. By including a small proportion of each fluorescently labeled ddNTP (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, ddTTP) along with normal dNTPs, chain termination occurs randomly at every position, producing fragments of every possible length that reveal the DNA sequence when separated by capillary electrophoresis.",

The gel is run with the negative electrode at the top and positive electrode at the bottom. In what order do the fragments appear from top (near wells) to bottom?",

        "C (1,000 bp), A (500 bp), B (2,000 bp)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "DNA is negatively charged (due to phosphate groups) and migrates toward the positive electrode (anode) during electrophoresis. Smaller fragments migrate faster through the gel matrix pores than larger fragments. Therefore, from top (near wells) to bottom: the largest fragment B (2,000 bp) travels the shortest distance, followed by C (1,000 bp), and the smallest fragment A (500 bp) travels the farthest. This inverse relationship between fragment size and migration distance is the basis for size determination using molecular weight markers (ladders).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In situ hybridization (ISH) uses labeled nucleic acid probes (DNA or RNA) that hybridize to complementary mRNA sequences directly within intact tissue sections or whole-mount specimens. This preserves spatial information, showing exactly which cells and tissues express the gene of interest. Northern blots detect mRNA but require tissue homogenization (losing spatial information). RT-PCR quantifies mRNA levels but also requires homogenized samples. Western blots detect protein, not mRNA. Fluorescent ISH (FISH) variants and single-molecule FISH (smFISH) can visualize individual mRNA molecules within cells with high spatial resolution.",

        "NGS uses radioactive rather than fluorescent labels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The revolutionary aspect of NGS is massively parallel sequencing—millions to billions of DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously. In Illumina sequencing: (1) DNA is fragmented and adapters are ligated; (2) fragments are bridge-amplified on a flow cell to create clusters of identical molecules; (3) fluorescently labeled reversible terminators allow one base to be incorporated and read per cycle across all clusters simultaneously. While individual reads are shorter than Sanger reads (typically 150-300 bp vs. 700-1000 bp for Sanger), the massive parallelism generates gigabases of data per run, enabling whole-genome sequencing at a fraction of the cost.",

        "Differences in chromosome number"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "RFLPs arise from DNA sequence variations that alter restriction enzyme recognition sites or change the distance between sites. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within a restriction site can abolish the site, creating a larger uncut fragment. Alternatively, insertions, deletions, or variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) between two sites change the fragment length without altering the sites themselves. RFLPs are detected by restriction digestion followed by gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. While largely replaced by STR profiling and SNP genotyping, RFLPs were foundational in the development of genetic mapping and forensic DNA profiling.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Creating a knockout (loss-of-function) organism by disrupting or deleting the gene provides the most direct evidence of gene function. If removing a gene causes a specific phenotype (e.g., developmental defect, disease, behavioral change), this directly links the gene to that function. CRISPR-Cas9 has made gene knockout much faster and more precise than traditional methods (homologous recombination with targeting vectors). Complementary approaches include: rescue experiments (restoring the gene corrects the phenotype), conditional knockouts (tissue-specific or temporal inactivation), and knock-in experiments. While homology searches, expression analysis, and computational predictions provide important information, they cannot definitively establish function—only perturbation experiments can.",

      "options": [
        "Yes, the suspect can be definitively excluded because the alleles do not match",
        "Yes, because forensic DNA must show exact matches at all loci",
        "The STR evidence is inconclusive regardless of the results",
        "No, the suspect cannot be excluded—they share one allele (12), and the other allele (14) could have come from a different contributor if this is a mixed sample"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The suspect (12,12 homozygote) shares one allele (12) with the evidence sample (12,14). If the evidence is a single-source sample, the suspect can be excluded because they lack the 14-repeat allele. However, if the evidence could be a mixture of DNA from two or more individuals (common at crime scenes), the suspect cannot be excluded—the 12 allele could be from the suspect and the 14 from another contributor. This illustrates why forensic DNA interpretation requires careful consideration of mixture possibilities, and why multiple STR loci (typically 20+ in modern kits) are analyzed to achieve extremely high discriminating power. The random match probability for 20+ STR loci is typically less than 1 in a trillion.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Ct (threshold cycle) or Cq (quantification cycle) value is the PCR cycle number at which the fluorescent signal first crosses a defined threshold above background. Because PCR amplification is exponential during the log-linear phase, samples with more initial template DNA reach the threshold in fewer cycles (lower Ct), while samples with less template require more cycles (higher Ct). A difference of one Ct value represents approximately a 2-fold difference in initial template quantity (since each PCR cycle doubles the DNA).

(2) Separate fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis. (3) Denature DNA in the gel (alkali treatment). (4) Transfer (blot) DNA fragments to a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action or vacuum. (5) Fix DNA to membrane (UV crosslinking or baking).

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has become the preferred vector for in vivo gene therapy because: (1) low immunogenicity—minimal immune response compared to adenovirus; (2) broad tissue tropism—different AAV serotypes can target different tissues (AAV9 for CNS, AAV8 for liver); (3) ability to infect non-dividing cells (unlike retrovirus/lentivirus for some applications); (4) predominantly remains episomal (does not integrate into the host genome, reducing insertional mutagenesis risk); (5) long-term stable expression in non-dividing cells.

This was surprising because: (1) the nematode C. elegans has ~20,000 genes and many other organisms have similar gene counts, suggesting increased complexity doesn't simply require more genes; (2) much of human genome complexity arises from alternative splicing (one gene producing multiple protein variants), regulatory complexity, and non-coding RNAs; (3) protein-coding sequences represent only ~1.5% of the human genome, with the remainder consisting of introns, regulatory regions, repetitive elements, and other non-coding sequences.",

      "explanation": "Producing functional human insulin in E. coli faces several challenges: (1) E. coli lacks eukaryotic protein processing—insulin is naturally synthesized as preproinsulin, which is processed by signal peptidase and prohormone convertases in the ER and Golgi, and folded with specific disulfide bonds. (2) E. coli cannot perform these post-translational modifications. Solution: the A chain (21 amino acids) and B chain (30 amino acids) are produced separately as fusion proteins in E. coli, purified, and then combined in vitro under conditions that promote correct disulfide bond formation (two inter-chain and one intra-chain disulfide bond). Alternatively, proinsulin can be produced and enzymatically processed in vitro. This was among the first therapeutic proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology (approved 1982).",

The 5 kb fragment is split into 4 kb + 1 kb (= 5 kb) by HindIII. The 3 kb fragment becomes the 2 kb + 1 kb fragments? No: 2 + 1 = 3. But then HindIII cuts both EcoRI fragments, giving 4 fragments from 2 HindIII sites. However, we established there are only 2 HindIII sites total. The HindIII site splits the 5 kb EcoRI fragment into 4 kb and 1 kb. The 3 kb and 2 kb remaining fragments come from the arrangement on the circular molecule. Working through the circular map confirms the HindIII site is within the 5 kb EcoRI fragment.",

However, the spacers in the CRISPR array are NOT flanked by PAM sequences, while the same sequences in foreign DNA are. Cas9 first recognizes the PAM on the target DNA before checking for gRNA complementarity. Since the host CRISPR locus lacks PAMs adjacent to its spacers, self-cleavage is prevented.

(2) Steric blocking—some ASOs (especially those with 2'-modified sugars) physically block ribosome scanning or splicing machinery without triggering RNase H. (3) Splice modulation—ASOs targeting splice sites can alter pre-mRNA splicing, either skipping exons (exon skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: eteplirsen) or including exons normally skipped. Chemical modifications (phosphorothioate backbone, 2'-O-methyl, locked nucleic acids) improve stability, binding affinity, and pharmacokinetics. FDA-approved ASO drugs include nusinersen (SMA), mipomersen (hypercholesterolemia), and inotersen (TTR amyloidosis).",

This exponential amplification is what makes PCR so powerful—from a single DNA molecule, detectable quantities of DNA can be generated in about 2-3 hours.

This shorter isoform retains the antibody epitope (since the epitope-containing region is in a different exon) but has lower molecular weight.

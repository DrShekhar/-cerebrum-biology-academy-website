      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Approximately 45% of the human genome consists of transposable elements and their derived sequences (SINEs like Alu elements ~13%, LINEs like L1 ~20%, DNA transposons ~3%, LTR retrotransposons ~8%). This far exceeds the fraction in introns (~25% of the genome), pseudogenes (~1%), or protein-coding exons (~1.5%). Transposable elements have accumulated over evolutionary time and, although most are now inactive, their remnants constitute the largest identifiable component of non-coding DNA. Other repetitive sequences include tandem repeats (satellite DNA, micro/minisatellites) comprising about 3% of the genome.",

        "Both copies always retain their original function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "After gene duplication, the most common fate is pseudogenization (nonfunctionalization)—one copy accumulates mutations (nonsense mutations, frameshifts, regulatory mutations) that render it non-functional, becoming a pseudogene. This occurs because redundancy relaxes selective constraint on the duplicate. Less commonly: (1) neofunctionalization—one copy acquires mutations that confer a new function while the other retains the original function; (2) subfunctionalization—the two copies partition the ancestral function between them (e.g., each retaining expression in different tissues), a process described by the DDC (duplication-degeneration-complementation) model. Gene duplication is not lethal; in fact, it is a primary source of genetic novelty.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 2R (two rounds) hypothesis proposes that two successive whole-genome duplication (WGD) events occurred in the stem lineage of vertebrates, approximately 500-600 million years ago. This would explain why vertebrates often have four copies of genes found as single copies in invertebrate outgroups (e.g., four HOX gene clusters in vertebrates vs. one in amphioxus). Evidence supporting 2R includes: (1) many vertebrate gene families have 4 members, (2) conserved synteny blocks appear in groups of four, and (3) phylogenetic analyses of gene families are consistent with two WGD events. Additional lineage-specific WGDs occurred in teleost fish (3R) and in many plant lineages.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Despite ~75-90 million years of divergent evolution, the human and mouse genomes share extensive syntenic blocks—groups of genes that maintain the same order and relative orientation on chromosomes. Approximately 90% of the human and mouse genomes can be partitioned into corresponding syntenic blocks. This conservation indicates that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, inversions) have occurred at a relatively slow rate during mammalian evolution. Breakpoints between syntenic blocks often occur near repetitive elements (particularly SINEs and LINEs) that may facilitate chromosomal rearrangements.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The globin gene superfamily evolved through a series of gene duplication events: (1) An ancestral globin gene duplicated ~500 million years ago to produce the alpha-globin and beta-globin ancestor genes. (2) Each of these duplicated again to produce the modern clusters: the alpha cluster (chromosome 16: zeta, alpha2, alpha1) and beta cluster (chromosome 11: epsilon, gamma-G, gamma-A, delta, beta). (3) Differential expression during development (embryonic, fetal, adult) resulted from divergence of regulatory elements after duplication.

        "Human chromosomes are more tightly packed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The C-value paradox: genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity or gene number. The 8-fold size difference between human and Fugu genomes is due to: (1) Repetitive elements—human genome is ~45% transposable elements vs. ~2.7% in Fugu. (2) Intron size—human introns are much larger on average (several kb) compared to Fugu introns (typically < 1 kb). (3) Intergenic regions—spaces between genes are much larger in the human genome. The Fugu genome was specifically chosen for sequencing because its compact size made it an efficient model for identifying conserved functional sequences. Despite having similar gene numbers, the 'packaging' differs enormously, with most of the human genome being non-coding.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Transposable element exaptation (co-option or domestication) occurs when TE-derived sequences acquire beneficial regulatory or coding functions for the host genome. Examples include: (1) TE-derived enhancers—many mammalian enhancers originated from TE insertions (e.g., MER41 elements provided interferon-responsive enhancers in immunity genes). (2) TE-derived promoters—some genes use TE-derived sequences as alternative promoters. (3) TE-derived insulators—CTCF binding sites have been distributed throughout mammalian genomes by SINE elements. (4) TE-derived coding sequences—syncytin genes (essential for placenta formation in mammals) were derived from retroviral envelope genes.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Bacteria acquire foreign DNA through three main HGT mechanisms: (1) Conjugation—direct transfer of DNA (usually plasmids) between cells through pili or other cell-to-cell contact structures. F-plasmids and conjugative transposons facilitate this process. (2) Transformation—uptake of free (extracellular) DNA from the environment by naturally competent bacteria. (3) Transduction—accidental packaging of host DNA into bacteriophage particles during phage replication, which is then injected into a new bacterial cell. HGT has profound evolutionary implications: it enables rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes, creates mosaic genomes, complicates phylogenetic analysis (gene trees vs. species trees), and has shaped metabolic capabilities across the bacterial domain.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "ENCODE's claim that ~80% of the genome is functional was based on biochemical criteria: evidence of transcription, transcription factor binding, histone modification, or chromatin accessibility. Critics (Graur et al., Doolittle, others) argue this conflates biochemical activity with biological function—evolution-based analyses suggest that only 5-15% of the genome is under purifying selection (and thus demonstrably functional). Much pervasive transcription may be 'transcriptional noise' without adaptive significance. The debate hinges on definitions: if 'function' means any biochemical activity, ~80% qualifies; if 'function' requires demonstrated contribution to organismal fitness (evolutionary conservation), the fraction is much smaller.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Identifying true orthologs (genes in different species derived from a common ancestral gene by speciation) requires distinguishing them from paralogs (genes related by duplication). The gold-standard approach: (1) Reciprocal best BLAST hit (RBH)—if gene X in species A finds gene Y as best hit in species B, and gene Y finds gene X as best hit in species A, they are likely orthologs. (2) Phylogenetic analysis—build a gene tree including all homologs from multiple species; orthologs cluster by speciation events, paralogs cluster by duplication events. (3) Synteny analysis—orthologs often retain conserved genomic neighborhood. Tools like OrthoFinder, OMA, and InParanoid integrate these approaches. Simple sequence similarity searches alone cannot reliably distinguish orthologs from paralogs.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are genomic sequences of 200+ bp that are perfectly or nearly perfectly conserved between distantly related vertebrate species (e.g., human, mouse, chicken, fish). Their extreme conservation implies very strong purifying selection, yet most are non-coding. Many UCEs function as long-range enhancers regulating developmental genes—particularly transcription factors involved in brain development and limb patterning. Deletion of some UCEs in mice causes developmental abnormalities. The conservation of UCEs far exceeds that of most protein-coding sequences, suggesting they play critical roles that are intolerant of even minor sequence changes.

Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and their insertion requires the reverse transcriptase encoded by LINE-1 (L1) elements—thus they are non-autonomous retrotransposons. Alu elements comprise ~13% of the human genome (~1.1 million copies). They are primate-specific SINEs (derived from 7SL RNA). Despite being largely inactive today, Alu insertions continue to cause genetic disease (~0.1% of human genetic disorders) and contribute to genome evolution through exonization, alternative splicing regulation, and as sources of new regulatory elements.",

This dramatically expands the proteome—the ~20,000 human genes encode an estimated 80,000-100,000+ distinct proteins. Alternative splicing can involve: exon skipping (the most common form), alternative 5' or 3' splice site selection, intron retention, and mutually exclusive exons.

Unprocessed (duplicated) pseudogenes arise from DNA-level gene duplication. They retain intron-exon structure but have accumulated disabling mutations (stop codons, frameshifts, splice site mutations). The human genome contains ~13,000 pseudogenes.

(3) Human-accelerated regions (HARs) are genomic sequences highly conserved among mammals but showing rapid human-specific changes—many are non-coding regulatory elements, including HAR1, which is associated with cortical development. (4) Changes in transcription factor binding sites can alter when, where, and how much a gene is expressed, producing phenotypic differences without changing the protein itself.",

(2) Gene conversion—non-reciprocal recombination events where one gene copy converts another to its sequence.

      "explanation": "Formaldehyde cross-linking is the critical first step because it: (1) Creates covalent bonds between proteins and nearby DNA (and protein-protein cross-links), preserving in vivo interactions that would otherwise be disrupted during cell lysis and subsequent biochemical manipulation. (2) Is reversible by heating (65°C overnight), allowing recovery of purified DNA after immunoprecipitation. (3) Cross-links within a range of ~2 Angstroms, capturing only proteins in direct or very close contact with DNA. Without cross-linking, most transcription factor-DNA interactions (which are dynamic and often low-affinity) would be lost during chromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation steps. The cross-linking time must be carefully optimized—too little results in poor capture, too much causes over-cross-linking and chromatin that is difficult to fragment.",

(2) When it re-anneals, it may mispair by one or more repeat units (slippage). (3) If the nascent strand loops out, an extra repeat is added; if the template loops out, a repeat is deleted. Mutation rates are 10⁻³-10⁻⁴ per locus per generation—1,000-10,000x higher than point mutation rates.

      "explanation": "CRISPR-based gene drives exploit homology-directed repair (HDR) to spread engineered alleles through populations at rates exceeding Mendelian inheritance: (1) The gene drive cassette contains Cas9 and a guide RNA targeting the corresponding wild-type allele. (2) In heterozygous individuals (one drive allele, one wild-type), Cas9 cuts the wild-type allele. (3) The cell repairs the double-strand break using the drive-containing chromosome as a template (HDR), copying the entire drive cassette to the repaired chromosome. (4) The organism becomes homozygous for the drive allele. (5) All offspring inherit the drive. This can spread the engineered allele to >99% of a population within a few generations.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Definitive enhancer identification requires multiple complementary lines of evidence. Transgenic reporter assay is the gold standard in vivo test — if the sequence drives reporter expression in limb buds, it has enhancer activity (used in the VISTA Enhancer Browser project with >3,000 tested candidates). CRISPR deletion tests necessity in the endogenous context — e.g., ZRS enhancer deletion causes limb truncation. ChIP-seq for H3K27ac confirms active enhancer chromatin state (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+ = active enhancer). Chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq/Capture-C) verifies physical enhancer-promoter contact, essential since enhancers can act over 1 Mb distances. Bioinformatics alone suggests but doesn't prove function. Wrong cell type (fibroblasts) misses tissue-specific cofactors.",

      "explanation": "Gene conversion serves a diversifying role in MHC evolution. The MHC/HLA system is the most polymorphic genetic system known (HLA-B alone has >6,000 alleles), maintained by balancing selection for pathogen resistance. Gene conversion transfers short segments between different HLA alleles or between HLA genes during meiotic recombination, creating mosaic alleles with recombined polymorphic segments. Evidence: many HLA alleles appear as mosaics of segments from other alleles with breakpoints at recombination hotspots.

They associate with PIWI-clade proteins (MIWI, MILI, MIWI2 in mice; Piwi, Aubergine, AGO3 in Drosophila). Post-transcriptional silencing: the ping-pong cycle amplifies piRNAs — sense piRNAs (from TE mRNAs) guide cleavage of antisense transcripts and vice versa, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Transcriptional silencing: MIWI2-piRNA complexes direct de novo DNA methylation (via DNMT3L/DNMT3A) and H3K9me3 deposition at TE genomic loci. This epigenetic silencing is heritable. piRNAs are Dicer-independent (unlike miRNAs/siRNAs).

A chromosome or chromosomal region undergoes catastrophic shattering (possibly during mitosis when chromosomes are trapped in micronuclei, or through replication stress) producing tens to hundreds of fragments. These are reassembled by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR), resulting in massively rearranged chromosomes with random fragment order and orientation. Some fragments are lost, causing deletions. Found in 2-3% of all cancers and up to 25% of bone cancers.

(2) Compositional bias: different GC content from surrounding DNA suggests the gene originated from an organism with different base composition and hasn't yet undergone 'amelioration' (convergence to host GC content). (3) Flanking mobile elements: presence of integrase genes, insertion sequences (IS elements), direct repeats, or association with genomic islands, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), or plasmids provides the mechanism of transfer. (4) Phylogenetic incongruence: gene tree differing from species tree (the gene clusters the two bacteria together rather than with their closest relatives).

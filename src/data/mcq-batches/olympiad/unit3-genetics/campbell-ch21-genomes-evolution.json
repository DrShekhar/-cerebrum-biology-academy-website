      "explanation": "Approximately 45% of the human genome consists of transposable elements and their derived sequences (SINEs like Alu elements ~13%, LINEs like L1 ~20%, DNA transposons ~3%, LTR retrotransposons ~8%). This far exceeds the fraction in introns (~25% of the genome), pseudogenes (~1%), or protein-coding exons (~1.5%). Transposable elements have accumulated over evolutionary time and, although most are now inactive, their remnants constitute the largest identifiable component of non-coding DNA. Other repetitive sequences include tandem repeats (satellite DNA, micro/minisatellites) comprising about 3% of the genome.",

      "explanation": "After gene duplication, the most common fate is pseudogenization (nonfunctionalization)\u2014one copy accumulates mutations (nonsense mutations, frameshifts, regulatory mutations) that render it non-functional, becoming a pseudogene. This occurs because redundancy relaxes selective constraint on the duplicate. Less commonly: (1) neofunctionalization\u2014one copy acquires mutations that confer a new function while the other retains the original function; (2) subfunctionalization\u2014the two copies partition the ancestral function between them (e.g., each retaining expression in different tissues), a process described by the DDC (duplication-degeneration-complementation) model.

      "explanation": "The 2R (two rounds) hypothesis proposes that two successive whole-genome duplication (WGD) events occurred in the stem lineage of vertebrates, approximately 500-600 million years ago. This would explain why vertebrates often have four copies of genes found as single copies in invertebrate outgroups (e.g., four HOX gene clusters in vertebrates vs. one in amphioxus). Evidence supporting 2R includes: (1) many vertebrate gene families have 4 members, (2) conserved synteny blocks appear in groups of four, and (3) phylogenetic analyses of gene families are consistent with two WGD events. Additional lineage-specific WGDs occurred in teleost fish (3R) and in many plant lineages.",

Approximately 90% of the human and mouse genomes can be partitioned into corresponding syntenic blocks. This conservation indicates that large-scale chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, inversions) have occurred at a relatively slow rate during mammalian evolution. Breakpoints between syntenic blocks often occur near repetitive elements (particularly SINEs and LINEs) that may facilitate chromosomal rearrangements.

      "explanation": "The globin gene superfamily evolved through a series of gene duplication events: (1) An ancestral globin gene duplicated ~500 million years ago to produce the alpha-globin and beta-globin ancestor genes. (2) Each of these duplicated again to produce the modern clusters: the alpha cluster (chromosome 16: zeta, alpha2, alpha1) and beta cluster (chromosome 11: epsilon, gamma-G, gamma-A, delta, beta). (3) Differential expression during development (embryonic, fetal, adult) resulted from divergence of regulatory elements after duplication. This is a textbook example of gene family evolution through duplication and divergence.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The C-value paradox: genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity or gene number. The 8-fold size difference between human and Fugu genomes is due to: (1) Repetitive elements\u2014human genome is ~45% transposable elements vs. ~2.7% in Fugu. (2) Intron size\u2014human introns are much larger on average (several kb) compared to Fugu introns (typically < 1 kb). (3) Intergenic regions\u2014spaces between genes are much larger in the human genome. The Fugu genome was specifically chosen for sequencing because its compact size made it an efficient model for identifying conserved functional sequences.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Transposable element exaptation (co-option or domestication) occurs when TE-derived sequences acquire beneficial regulatory or coding functions for the host genome. Examples include: (1) TE-derived enhancers\u2014many mammalian enhancers originated from TE insertions (e.g., MER41 elements provided interferon-responsive enhancers in immunity genes). (2) TE-derived promoters\u2014some genes use TE-derived sequences as alternative promoters. (3) TE-derived insulators\u2014CTCF binding sites have been distributed throughout mammalian genomes by SINE elements. (4) TE-derived coding sequences\u2014syncytin genes (essential for placenta formation in mammals) were derived from retroviral envelope genes.

      "explanation": "Bacteria acquire foreign DNA through three main HGT mechanisms: (1) Conjugation\u2014direct transfer of DNA (usually plasmids) between cells through pili or other cell-to-cell contact structures. F-plasmids and conjugative transposons facilitate this process. (2) Transformation\u2014uptake of free (extracellular) DNA from the environment by naturally competent bacteria. (3) Transduction\u2014accidental packaging of host DNA into bacteriophage particles during phage replication, which is then injected into a new bacterial cell. HGT has profound evolutionary implications: it enables rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes, creates mosaic genomes, complicates phylogenetic analysis (gene trees vs. species trees), and has shaped metabolic capabilities across the bacterial domain.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "ENCODE's claim that ~80% of the genome is functional was based on biochemical criteria: evidence of transcription, transcription factor binding, histone modification, or chromatin accessibility. Critics (Graur et al., Doolittle, others) argue this conflates biochemical activity with biological function\u2014evolution-based analyses suggest that only 5-15% of the genome is under purifying selection (and thus demonstrably functional). Much pervasive transcription may be 'transcriptional noise' without adaptive significance. The debate hinges on definitions: if 'function' means any biochemical activity, ~80% qualifies; if 'function' requires demonstrated contribution to organismal fitness (evolutionary conservation), the fraction is much smaller.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Identifying true orthologs (genes in different species derived from a common ancestral gene by speciation) requires distinguishing them from paralogs (genes related by duplication). The gold-standard approach: (1) Reciprocal best BLAST hit (RBH)\u2014if gene X in species A finds gene Y as best hit in species B, and gene Y finds gene X as best hit in species A, they are likely orthologs. (2) Phylogenetic analysis\u2014build a gene tree including all homologs from multiple species; orthologs cluster by speciation events, paralogs cluster by duplication events. (3) Synteny analysis\u2014orthologs often retain conserved genomic neighborhood. Tools like OrthoFinder, OMA, and InParanoid integrate these approaches.

Their extreme conservation implies very strong purifying selection, yet most are non-coding. Many UCEs function as long-range enhancers regulating developmental genes\u2014particularly transcription factors involved in brain development and limb patterning. Deletion of some UCEs in mice causes developmental abnormalities.

Alu elements comprise ~13% of the human genome (~1.1 million copies). They are primate-specific SINEs (derived from 7SL RNA).

(3) Human-accelerated regions (HARs) are genomic sequences highly conserved among mammals but showing rapid human-specific changes\u2014many are non-coding regulatory elements, including HAR1, which is associated with cortical development.

E. coli has a compact genome where 87% encodes proteins, with minimal non-coding sequence. As genome size increases through eukaryotes, the coding fraction drops dramatically (to just 1.5% in humans). The genome size expansion is primarily due to: (1) accumulation of transposable elements and repetitive sequences, (2) expansion of introns, (3) expansion of intergenic regions, and (4) gene duplication events (including whole-genome duplications).

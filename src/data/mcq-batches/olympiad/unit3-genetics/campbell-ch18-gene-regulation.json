      "question": "The lac operon in E. coli is regulated by both negative control (LacI repressor) and positive control (CAP-cAMP). When glucose is absent and lactose is present, the operon is maximally transcribed. What molecular event triggers the positive regulation by the CAP-cAMP system?",
      "options": [
        "CAP phosphorylates the sigma factor to increase its affinity for the lac promoter",
        "Glucose inhibits the lac repressor, and when glucose is removed, the repressor falls off",
        "When glucose is absent, adenylyl cyclase is active and produces high levels of cAMP; cAMP binds to CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein), causing a conformational change that enables CAP-cAMP to bind a specific DNA site upstream of the lac promoter, bending the DNA and recruiting RNA polymerase to increase transcription ~50-fold",
        "CAP directly senses lactose in the medium and activates transcription"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The CAP-cAMP positive regulatory system provides catabolite repression (also called the glucose effect), ensuring that E. coli preferentially uses glucose over secondary carbon sources like lactose. The mechanism: (1) When glucose is present: The glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) transports glucose into the cell. During this process, the PTS component EIIAGlc is dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylated EIIAGlc directly inhibits adenylyl cyclase, resulting in low cAMP levels. Without cAMP, CAP cannot bind DNA, and lac operon transcription is minimal even if lactose is present (because the lac promoter is inherently weak without CAP assistance). (2) When glucose is absent: EIIAGlc accumulates in its phosphorylated form (P~EIIAGlc), which activates adenylyl cyclase. cAMP levels rise ~50-fold. (3) cAMP binding: cAMP binds to each monomer of the CAP homodimer (two cAMP molecules per CAP dimer), inducing a conformational change in the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. (4) DNA binding: Activated CAP-cAMP binds to a specific 22-bp palindromic sequence centered at position -61.5 relative to the lac transcription start site. (5) Transcription activation: CAP bends the DNA approximately 90 degrees and makes direct protein-protein contacts with the alpha-CTD (C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit) of RNA polymerase. This interaction recruits and stabilizes RNA polymerase at the weak lac promoter, increasing transcription approximately 50-fold. Full induction of the lac operon requires BOTH conditions: lactose present (repressor released) AND glucose absent (CAP-cAMP active).",

      "options": [
        "Methylated DNA is rapidly degraded by cellular nucleases",
        "Methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs like MeCP2) recognize methylated CpG sites and recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and histone methyltransferases that establish repressive chromatin marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3), compacting chromatin into a transcriptionally silent state",

        "CpG methylation changes the genetic code, converting cytosine codons to thymine codons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing operates through a multi-layered mechanism that connects DNA methylation to chromatin remodeling: (1) DNA methyltransferases: DNMT3A and DNMT3B establish new methylation patterns (de novo methylation), while DNMT1 maintains existing patterns during DNA replication by methylating hemimethylated CpG sites on the newly synthesized strand. (2) Methyl-CpG recognition: Methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins constitute a family of readers that specifically recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides. The founding member MeCP2 (Methyl-CpG binding Protein 2, mutations in which cause Rett syndrome) was the first characterized. Other family members include MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4. (3) Recruitment of corepressors: MeCP2 and MBD2 recruit the NuRD (Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase) complex, which contains: HDAC1/HDAC2 (histone deacetylases that remove activating acetyl marks from histone tails), CHD3/CHD4 (ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes), and MTA1/2 (metastasis-associated proteins). (4) Histone modification cascade: HDACs remove acetyl groups from H3K9ac and H3K27ac (activating marks). Histone methyltransferases (SUV39H1 for H3K9me3, EZH2/PRC2 for H3K27me3) then add repressive methyl marks. (5) Heterochromatin formation: H3K9me3 recruits HP1 (Heterochromatin Protein 1), which oligomerizes to compact chromatin and recruit more SUV39H1, creating a self-reinforcing silencing loop. (6) Direct blockade: In some cases, methylation of CpG sites within transcription factor binding motifs directly prevents factor binding (e.g., methylation of CTCF binding sites alters chromatin topology).",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "H3K4me3 is one of the most well-characterized activating histone marks and serves as a hallmark of active and poised gene promoters. Its biology involves: (1) Writers: H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by SET domain-containing methyltransferases. In humans, these include SET1A/SET1B and MLL1-4 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia), which function as part of COMPASS (Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1) complexes. The complexes also contain WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY-30. (2) Distribution: H3K4me3 is sharply enriched at active transcription start sites (within ~1 kb of the TSS) in a bimodal distribution flanking the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR). H3K4me1 marks active enhancers, while H3K4me2 is found at both promoters and enhancers. (3) Readers: H3K4me3 is recognized by several effector proteins: (a) TAF3 (a subunit of TFIID) contains a PHD finger that binds H3K4me3, helping recruit the general transcription machinery to active promoters. (b) CHD1 chromatin remodeler has a tandem chromodomain that binds H3K4me3 and repositions nucleosomes for transcription. (c) BPTF (bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor), a subunit of the NURF remodeling complex, recognizes H3K4me3. (d) ING (Inhibitor of Growth) family proteins contain PHD fingers that read H3K4me3. (4) Cross-talk: H3K4me3 is mutually exclusive with H3K9me3 (repressive mark) on the same histone tail, ensuring a binary active/silent state.

      "question": "Researchers perform ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) for H3K4me3 (active promoter mark) and H3K27me3 (repressive mark) in embryonic stem cells. They identify a subset of ~2,000 gene promoters that simultaneously carry both marks \u2014 termed 'bivalent domains.' When these ESCs differentiate into neurons, the bivalent domains resolve: neural genes lose H3K27me3 and retain H3K4me3, while non-neural developmental genes lose H3K4me3 and retain H3K27me3. What does this bivalent state represent?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Bivalent chromatin domains, discovered by Bernstein et al. (2006), represent one of the most important concepts in stem cell epigenetics and developmental biology: (1) Structure: Bivalent domains consist of broad H3K27me3 domains (deposited by PRC2/EZH2) containing narrow peaks of H3K4me3 (deposited by MLL2/KMT2B) at the TSS. Single-cell and sequential ChIP experiments confirmed that both marks can co-exist on the same allele and even on the same nucleosome (H3K4me3 on one H3 tail, H3K27me3 on the other H3 tail in the same nucleosome). (2) Gene targets: Bivalent domains predominantly mark promoters of key developmental transcription factors (HOX genes, SOX genes, PAX genes, FOX genes) that are silent in ESCs but must be activated in specific lineages during differentiation. (3) Functional significance: The bivalent state creates a 'poised' gene that is transcriptionally silent but epigenetically primed for rapid activation. H3K27me3 maintains repression (preventing premature differentiation), while H3K4me3 prevents stable silencing (maintaining future activation potential). Without H3K4me3, these genes might become permanently silenced (like repetitive elements). (4) Resolution during differentiation: When differentiation signals arrive, lineage-appropriate genes: lose H3K27me3 (via UTX/KDM6A/JMJD3 demethylases recruited by lineage-specific transcription factors), retain H3K4me3, and become actively transcribed. Genes for other lineages: retain or gain H3K27me3, lose H3K4me3, and become stably silenced. (5) Disease relevance: Disruption of bivalent domain regulators (EZH2, MLL2, UTX) is common in cancer and developmental disorders.",

      "options": [
        "Xist encodes a protein that directly degrades one X chromosome",
        "Xist RNA is transcribed from the X inactivation center (Xic) and coats the future inactive X chromosome in cis; it recruits PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) and other silencing factors through interaction with proteins like SPEN/SHARP, leading to H3K27me3 deposition, histone deacetylation, DNA methylation, and formation of the condensed Barr body",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "X-chromosome inactivation is one of the best-studied examples of epigenetic silencing and involves a complex, multi-step process orchestrated by the long non-coding RNA Xist: (1) Choice and counting: In each female cell, one X chromosome is randomly chosen for inactivation. The choice mechanism involves the antisense transcript Tsix, which represses Xist on the future active X (Xa). On the future inactive X (Xi), Tsix is downregulated, allowing Xist expression. (2) Xist coating: Xist RNA (~17 kb in mouse) is transcribed from the Xi and spreads along the chromosome in cis, coating the entire Xi. Xist spreading follows a specific pattern, first accumulating at gene-dense regions. (3) Silencing factor recruitment: Xist contains multiple functional domains (Repeats A, B, C, E, F) that recruit different silencing effectors. Repeat A recruits SPEN/SHARP, which interacts with the NCoR/SMRT-HDAC3 corepressor complex to deacetylate histones \u2014 this is the earliest and most critical silencing step. Repeat B recruits PCGF3/5 (PRC1 variant), which monoubiquitinates H2AK119. H2AK119ub recruits PRC2, which deposits H3K27me3. (4) Chromatin compaction: Progressive accumulation of repressive marks leads to loss of active marks (H3K4me3, acetylation), incorporation of histone variant macroH2A, late DNA methylation of CpG islands, and spatial reorganization into the Barr body. (5) Maintenance: Once established, XCI is stably maintained through cell divisions by DNA methylation and histone modifications, independent of continued Xist expression (though Xist continues to be expressed from Xi).",

        "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-False"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "All four statements are TRUE: S1 is TRUE: When glucose is absent (high cAMP \u2192 CAP-cAMP binds upstream site) but lactose is also absent (repressor binds operator), there is a conflict between activation and repression. The repressor wins because it physically blocks RNA polymerase access to the promoter. However, because repressor binding is not 100% efficient (dynamic equilibrium), there is a very low basal transcription level (~0.1% of fully induced). This basal level is important because it produces the small amount of beta-galactosidase and permease needed to import and convert the first molecules of lactose to allolactose, allowing initial induction. S2 is TRUE: IPTG is a synthetic analog of allolactose widely used in molecular biology. It binds the lac repressor with high affinity and induces the conformational change that releases the repressor from DNA. However, IPTG lacks the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond that beta-galactosidase cleaves in lactose/allolactose, making it non-hydrolyzable. This ensures stable, sustained induction at constant concentrations \u2014 critical for controlled gene expression experiments using lac-based expression systems. S3 is TRUE: The lac repressor is a homotetramer (dimer of dimers). One dimer binds O1 (the primary operator overlapping the promoter), while the other dimer simultaneously binds O2 (+401, within lacZ) or O3 (-82, within CAP binding site) through DNA looping. This looping increases repression ~70-fold compared to O1 alone, because it stabilizes repressor-operator binding. S4 is TRUE: Allolactose (1,6-allolactose) is produced when beta-galactosidase performs an intramolecular transglycosylation on lactose, creating a 1\u21926 linkage instead of the normal 1\u21924 linkage. This creates a positive feedback circuit \u2014 enough basal beta-galactosidase converts lactose to allolactose, which induces more operon expression.",

        "PRC2 directly contacts RNA polymerase to prevent promoter binding without any histone modifications"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Polycomb repressive system represents one of the best-characterized epigenetic silencing mechanisms. The classical hierarchical model describes a sequential recruitment pathway: PRC2 complex: (1) Core subunits: EZH2 (or EZH1) is the catalytic SET-domain methyltransferase, with EED, SUZ12, and RbAp46/48 as essential accessory subunits. (2) Function: PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K27. H3K27me3 is the repressive mark. (3) PRC2 is recruited to target genes through multiple mechanisms: interaction with long non-coding RNAs (e.g., Xist, HOTAIR), recognition of unmethylated CpG islands (variant PRC2 with JARID2 and AEBP2), and propagation through recognition of existing H3K27me3 (allosteric activation of EZH2 by EED binding H3K27me3 on neighboring nucleosomes). Canonical PRC1 complex: (4) The CBX subunit (CBX2/4/6/7/8) contains a chromodomain that specifically recognizes and binds H3K27me3 deposited by PRC2. (5) Once recruited, PRC1's RING1A/RING1B E3 ubiquitin ligase (with BMI1/PCGF4) monoubiquitinates histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). (6) H2AK119ub1 compacts chromatin fibers and blocks RNA Pol II elongation by preventing the recruitment of the FACT histone chaperone. However, recent work has revised this model: variant PRC1 (containing PCGF1/3/5/6 instead of CBX) can act independently of PRC2 and actually recruits PRC2 through H2AK119ub1, creating a feed-forward loop.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Testing the DNA methylation hypothesis requires both functional and direct measurement approaches: (1) 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) or its deoxy derivative 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) treatment: These are nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into DNA during replication. Once incorporated, they form covalent adducts with DNMT1, trapping and inactivating the enzyme. This causes passive, replication-dependent loss of DNA methylation (because DNMT1 can no longer methylate the newly synthesized strand). If the gene is silenced by methylation, 5-azacytidine treatment should reactivate its expression, measurable by RT-qPCR. This provides functional evidence that methylation is responsible for silencing. (2) Bisulfite sequencing: Bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil (read as thymine after PCR), while methylated cytosines are protected and remain as cytosines. Sequencing the bisulfite-converted DNA reveals the methylation status of every CpG dinucleotide in the region. Comparing the promoter CpG island between normal cells (expected: unmethylated \u2192 many C\u2192T conversions) and cancer cells (expected: methylated \u2192 cytosines preserved) provides direct molecular evidence. (3) Additional supporting experiments would include: ChIP for repressive marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) at the promoter, MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation), treatment with HDAC inhibitors (e.g., SAHA) which may synergize with 5-azacytidine, and CRISPR-based targeted demethylation using dCas9-TET1 fusion to prove causality at the specific locus.",

      "explanation": "TADs (Topologically Associating Domains) are fundamental units of 3D genome organization, typically 200 kb to 2 Mb in size, within which chromatin preferentially interacts. TAD boundaries are established by a loop extrusion mechanism involving cohesin and CTCF: (1) Cohesin loading: The cohesin complex (a ring-shaped structure of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21/SCC1, and SA1/SA2) is loaded onto chromatin by the NIPBL-MAU2 loader complex, typically at active promoters and enhancers. (2) Loop extrusion: Cohesin acts as a molecular motor that actively extrudes chromatin through its ring, progressively enlarging the loop. This process requires ATP and creates loops that bring distant genomic elements into proximity. (3) CTCF boundary formation: CTCF proteins bind to specific DNA motifs (consensus: CCCTC + flanking sequences). Cohesin extrusion is blocked when it encounters two CTCF proteins bound to convergently oriented motifs (facing each other on opposite strands). This creates a stable loop anchor \u2014 the TAD boundary. (4) Orientation dependence: The directionality of CTCF motifs is critical. Only convergent (inward-facing) CTCF sites form stable boundaries. Tandem or divergent orientations allow cohesin to pass through. Inverting a CTCF site by CRISPR can redirect loop formation and alter gene expression. (5) Functional significance: TAD boundaries insulate enhancers and promoters in different TADs, preventing inappropriate gene activation. TAD disruption (by deletion or inversion of CTCF sites) can cause developmental disorders and cancer through enhancer hijacking \u2014 where an enhancer inappropriately activates a gene in an adjacent TAD.",

Drosha cleaves both strands of the stem approximately 11 bp from the base of the stem and ~22 bp from the loop, releasing a ~65-70 nt hairpin precursor (pre-miRNA) with a 2-nt 3' overhang (characteristic of RNase III cleavage). (3) Nuclear export: The pre-miRNA is recognized and exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 (XPO5) in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner. Exportin-5 recognizes the 2-nt 3' overhang and the double-stranded stem structure. (4) Cytoplasmic processing: Dicer (another RNase III enzyme, complexed with TRBP) recognizes the pre-miRNA, measuring from the 3' overhang, and cleaves the loop region to produce a ~22 bp miRNA duplex with 2-nt 3' overhangs on both ends. (5) RISC loading: The miRNA duplex is loaded into an Argonaute protein (AGO1-4 in humans). The strand with the less thermodynamically stable 5' end is retained as the guide strand (mature miRNA), while the other strand (passenger/miRNA*) is discarded. (6) Target recognition: The mature miRNA guides RISC to complementary sequences in target mRNA 3' UTRs.",

      "options": [
        "Attenuation occurs when excess tryptophan molecules physically block RNA polymerase movement",
        "Attenuation relies on coupling of transcription and translation in prokaryotes: when tryptophan is abundant, ribosomes rapidly translate a leader peptide containing two consecutive Trp codons, allowing a downstream terminator hairpin (3:4 structure) to form in the mRNA, causing RNA polymerase to dissociate before transcribing the structural genes",
        "Attenuation involves the binding of tryptophan directly to the mRNA, which causes its degradation",
        "Attenuation involves a ribozyme in the trp leader that self-cleaves when tryptophan is present"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Attenuation of the trp operon is an elegant regulatory mechanism discovered by Charles Yanofsky that exploits the coupling of transcription and translation unique to prokaryotes. The trp leader sequence (trpL) encodes a 14-amino-acid leader peptide containing two tandem tryptophan codons (Trp-Trp at positions 10-11). The leader mRNA contains four regions (1-4) that can form alternative secondary structures: regions 1:2 form an anti-terminator, regions 2:3 form a pause site that stalls RNA polymerase to allow ribosome loading, and regions 3:4 form a rho-independent transcription terminator. When tryptophan is ABUNDANT: charged tRNATrp is plentiful, so the ribosome rapidly translates through the Trp codons in region 1, reaches region 2, and prevents 2:3 pairing. This allows the 3:4 terminator hairpin to form, causing RNA polymerase to terminate transcription before reaching the structural genes (trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, trpA). Only the short leader transcript is produced. When tryptophan is SCARCE: uncharged tRNATrp accumulates, and the ribosome stalls at the tandem Trp codons in region 1. This leaves region 2 free to pair with region 3 (anti-terminator), preventing the 3:4 terminator from forming. RNA polymerase reads through and transcribes the structural genes. Attenuation fine-tunes expression ~8-fold, while repression provides ~70-fold regulation, giving ~600-fold combined regulation.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Drosophila Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) represents the most extreme example of regulated alternative splicing known: (1) Gene structure: The Dscam gene contains 115 exons, of which 95 are alternatively spliced in four clusters of mutually exclusive exons: exon 4 cluster (12 variants), exon 6 cluster (48 variants), exon 9 cluster (33 variants), and exon 17 cluster (2 variants). (2) Combinatorial diversity: 12 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 33 \u00d7 2 = 38,016 possible extracellular domain isoforms. This exceeds the total number of genes in the Drosophila genome (~14,000). Each isoform has a unique combination of immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that determine homophilic binding specificity. (3) Mutual exclusivity mechanism: Within each cluster, only one exon is selected. This is achieved through competing RNA secondary structures: a docking site in the constitutive exon upstream of each cluster base-pairs with a selector sequence unique to each alternative exon. The RNA structure formed first is selected, and the remaining alternative exons in that cluster are skipped. (4) Self-avoidance function: Each neuron stochastically expresses a subset of ~10-50 Dscam isoforms on its surface. When two neurites from the SAME neuron contact each other, their matching Dscam isoforms engage in homophilic binding, triggering mutual repulsion \u2014 this prevents neurites from fasciculating with themselves. Neurites from DIFFERENT neurons express different Dscam combinations, so they do not repel.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The classical C2H2 zinc finger is one of the most common DNA-binding domains in eukaryotic transcription factors (e.g., TFIIIA, Sp1, Kruppel). Each finger consists of ~30 amino acids forming a compact \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 structure stabilized by coordination of a Zn2+ ion between two cysteine residues in the \u03b2-sheet and two histidine residues in the \u03b1-helix. The \u03b1-helix inserts into the major groove and makes sequence-specific contacts with 3-4 base pairs. Proteins typically contain multiple tandem zinc fingers (Sp1 has 3, TFIIIA has 9), each contacting adjacent DNA subsites. S2 is TRUE: The leucine zipper (discovered by Steven McKnight, 1988) is a coiled-coil dimerization motif found in bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors like C/EBP, Jun, Fos, and CREB. Leucine residues occur at every seventh position (heptad repeat position 'd') in a ~30-residue \u03b1-helix. The hydrophobic leucines from two helices interdigitate like a zipper to mediate parallel coiled-coil dimerization. The basic region (immediately N-terminal to the zipper) contacts DNA in the major groove. Heterodimerization expands combinatorial diversity (e.g., Jun-Fos heterodimer = AP-1). S3 is FALSE: While HTH motifs were first characterized in prokaryotic regulators (lambda repressor, Cro, CAP), they are widely present in eukaryotes. The homeodomain is a 60-amino-acid HTH variant found in Hox genes and many developmental transcription factors. Winged-helix and forkhead (FOX) domains are also HTH-related motifs abundant in eukaryotes.

      "options": [
        "Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was orders of magnitude more effective at silencing than either sense or antisense single-stranded RNA alone, and the silencing was catalytic \u2014 substoichiometric amounts of dsRNA could silence much larger quantities of target mRNA, suggesting an amplified enzymatic mechanism",
        "RNAi required direct injection of protein into cells rather than nucleic acid",

        "RNAi only worked in plants and could not be replicated in animals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 1998 Nature paper by Fire and Mello that discovered RNAi (Nobel Prize 2006) made several groundbreaking observations in C. elegans: (1) dsRNA potency: When they injected dsRNA corresponding to the unc-22 gene (which encodes a muscle protein), they observed a dramatic twitching phenotype indicating unc-22 silencing. The same amount of sense or antisense single-stranded RNA alone produced little or no silencing. dsRNA was at least 10-100 times more potent than antisense RNA. (2) Catalytic nature: Very small amounts of dsRNA (just a few molecules per cell) could effectively silence the target gene, meaning the dsRNA must be acting catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. This suggested an enzymatic amplification mechanism \u2014 later shown to involve RISC recycling, where the Argonaute-siRNA complex is not consumed after cleaving one target mRNA but can cleave multiple target molecules. In C. elegans, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) further amplify the signal by synthesizing secondary siRNAs. (3) Systemic spreading: Remarkably, dsRNA injected into one tissue could silence the target gene throughout the organism, indicating cell-to-cell spreading. This was later attributed to the transmembrane channel SID-1 (Systemic RNA Interference Defective-1) that imports dsRNA. (4) Specificity: The silencing was exquisitely sequence-specific \u2014 only mRNAs with complementarity to the dsRNA trigger were affected. (5) Mechanism (later elucidated): Dicer cleaves long dsRNA into 21-23 nt siRNA duplexes; one strand is loaded into AGO2-containing RISC; the guide strand directs RISC to complementary mRNA; AGO2 cleaves the target between positions 10-11 relative to the guide.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This reporter analysis reveals the presence of a tissue-specific silencer element: (1) Construct A (full regulatory region \u2192 liver only, strong): The complete regulatory region contains all elements needed for proper tissue-specific expression. Strong expression in liver indicates the presence of a liver-specific enhancer somewhere in the 5 kb region. Absence of expression in kidney/brain indicates active repression in those tissues. (2) Construct B (proximal promoter only \u2192 weak ubiquitous): The core/proximal promoter (TATA box, initiator, CpG island) can recruit the basal transcription machinery in any cell type, resulting in low-level constitutive transcription. The absence of enhancers explains why expression is weak. The ubiquitous expression shows the promoter itself has no tissue specificity. (3) Construct C (full region minus 200 bp \u2192 liver + kidney + brain, strong): Removing the 200 bp element at -3.2 kb de-represses expression in kidney and brain while maintaining strong liver expression. This means: (a) The deleted element is NOT a liver enhancer (liver expression is maintained). (b) The deleted element is a silencer that actively represses transcription in non-liver tissues. (c) There must be separate enhancers that can drive expression in kidney and brain, but their activity is normally overridden by the silencer. (4) Silencer mechanism: Silencers bind transcriptional repressors (e.g., REST/NRSF for neuronal genes, or tissue-specific repressors) that recruit co-repressor complexes (NCoR, SMRT, HDACs) to establish repressive chromatin. Unlike insulators (which block enhancer-promoter communication), silencers directly repress transcription at target promoters.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Epigenetic reprogramming through genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs at two distinct developmental windows, each serving a unique biological purpose: (1) Post-fertilization reprogramming (zygote to blastocyst, E0.5-E3.5 in mouse): After fertilization, the paternal genome undergoes rapid ACTIVE demethylation mediated by TET3 (Ten-Eleven Translocation 3), which oxidizes 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), then to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) excises 5fC/5caC via base excision repair (BER). The maternal genome is demethylated more slowly through PASSIVE dilution \u2014 DNMT1 is excluded from the nucleus during early cleavage divisions, so methylation patterns are not maintained. Purpose: (a) Erase somatic epigenetic marks from gametes to restore totipotency. (b) Activate the embryonic genome (zygotic genome activation, ZGA) at the 2-cell stage (mouse) or 4-8 cell stage (human). (c) Allow establishment of the first cell fate decision (inner cell mass vs. trophectoderm). Important exceptions: Imprinted genes and certain retrotransposons escape this wave of demethylation, maintained by DNMT1 with the help of STELLA/PGC7 and ZFP57/KAP1 (TRIM28). (2) Primordial germ cell (PGC) reprogramming (E8.5-E13.5 in mouse): PGCs undergo the most comprehensive demethylation event in the mammalian life cycle, reducing global methylation from ~70% to ~7%. Both active (TET1/TET2) and passive mechanisms contribute. This erases: (a) Parental imprints \u2014 allowing new sex-appropriate imprints to be established (paternal imprints in spermatogenesis, maternal imprints in oogenesis). (b) Stable epigenetic marks that would otherwise transmit epigenetic information transgenerationally.

      "explanation": "The Igf2/H19 imprinted locus on mouse chromosome 7 (human chromosome 11p15.5) is the paradigm for understanding imprint-dependent insulator-mediated gene regulation: (1) Locus organization (5' to 3'): Igf2 gene \u2192 ICR (Imprinting Control Region, also called DMR/H19-ICR) \u2192 H19 gene \u2192 shared enhancers (endodermal and mesodermal). (2) Maternal allele: The ICR is unmethylated. The zinc-finger protein CTCF (11-zinc-finger protein) binds to four CTCF binding sites within the unmethylated ICR. CTCF binding creates an insulator/boundary element that physically blocks the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter. Instead, the enhancers activate H19 (the closest accessible gene). Result: H19 is expressed, Igf2 is silent. The insulator model was confirmed by deletion of CTCF binding sites (causing biallelic Igf2 expression) and by chromatin conformation capture (3C) showing distinct chromatin loop structures on each allele. (3) Paternal allele: The ICR is methylated (de novo methylation established during spermatogenesis by DNMT3A with cofactor DNMT3L). DNA methylation spreads from the ICR into the H19 promoter. Methylation has two effects: (a) CTCF cannot bind methylated DNA, so the insulator is inactive. (b) H19 promoter methylation silences H19. Without the insulator, the downstream enhancers can loop to and activate the Igf2 promoter. Result: Igf2 is expressed, H19 is silent. (4) Disease relevance: Loss of imprinting (LOI) at this locus causes Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (biallelic Igf2 \u2192 overgrowth, organomegaly, increased cancer risk) or Silver-Russell syndrome (biallelic H19/reduced Igf2 \u2192 growth restriction).",

      "explanation": "Establishing causality between a specific histone modification at a specific locus and gene expression requires locus-specific manipulation, which is best achieved using epigenome editing tools: (1) dCas9-UTX approach: Catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9, with D10A and H840A mutations that eliminate nuclease activity but retain DNA binding) is fused to the catalytic domain of UTX (also known as KDM6A), a Jumonji-domain demethylase that specifically removes H3K27me2/me3 marks (converting them to H3K27me1/me0). The fusion protein is guided to the target promoter by a complementary single-guide RNA (sgRNA). (2) Why this establishes causality: (a) Locus specificity: Only the targeted promoter is affected \u2014 other H3K27me3-marked genes throughout the genome remain silenced. This eliminates confounding effects from global demethylation. (b) Modification specificity: UTX specifically removes H3K27me3 without altering other histone modifications (H3K9me3, DNA methylation). (c) No DNA sequence change: Unlike gene knockouts or mutations, dCas9-UTX does not alter the DNA sequence, isolating the effect of the epigenetic mark. (3) Why alternatives are insufficient: (a) Global EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126, EPZ-6438) affect H3K27me3 at thousands of genomic loci, making it impossible to attribute gene reactivation to loss of H3K27me3 at the specific promoter. (b) Correlative approaches (ChIP-seq) only show association, not causation. A gene could be marked with H3K27me3 but silenced by an independent mechanism (e.g., DNA methylation). (c) Gene knockout is irrelevant \u2014 it tests gene function, not epigenetic regulation.

      "explanation": "The Mediator complex is a cornerstone of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, serving as the central integrator of regulatory signals: (1) Structure: Mammalian Mediator is a ~1.4 MDa complex consisting of 26-30 subunits organized into four modules: Head module (MED6, MED8, MED11, MED17, MED18, MED20, MED22) \u2014 directly contacts RNA Pol II CTD and TFIIH. Middle module (MED1, MED4, MED7, MED9, MED10, MED19, MED21, MED26, MED31) \u2014 connects head to tail.

CDK module (MED12, MED13, CDK8, CycC) \u2014 reversibly associates and can be activating or repressive. (2) Enhancer-promoter communication: Gene-specific transcription factors (e.g., p53, nuclear receptors, NF-\u03baB) bind to enhancer DNA and recruit Mediator through direct protein-protein interactions with tail subunits (e.g., nuclear receptors bind MED1/TRAP220 through LXXLL motifs). Mediator then bridges to the PIC at the promoter, stabilizing the TFIID-TFIIA-TFIIB-Pol II assembly. (3) Signal integration: Different activators contact different Mediator subunits, and the conformational flexibility of Mediator allows it to integrate these inputs. The CDK8 kinase module can phosphorylate activators, TFIIH, and histone H3, providing additional regulatory control. (4) Condensate formation: Recent work shows that Mediator, along with transcription factors and BRD4, forms liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates (super-enhancer hubs) at highly active genes, concentrating the transcription machinery and driving robust gene expression.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The IRP-IRE system is a classic example of coordinate post-transcriptional regulation. IRPs are cytoplasmic proteins that bind IRE stem-loop structures (~30 nt) in mRNA UTRs when intracellular iron is LOW. For ferritin mRNA: The single IRE in the 5' UTR is positioned near the cap. IRP binding sterically blocks the 43S ribosomal subunit from scanning, inhibiting translation. When iron is high, IRP1 acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster and becomes cytoplasmic aconitase (losing RNA-binding ability), while IRP2 is ubiquitinated by FBXL5 E3 ligase and degraded. Released ferritin mRNA is translated. For TfR mRNA: Five IREs in the 3' UTR are adjacent to an endonuclease cleavage site. IRP binding protects the mRNA from cleavage by the endonuclease. When iron is high and IRPs dissociate, the mRNA is cleaved and rapidly degraded. S2 is TRUE: NMD is a quality control surveillance pathway. During the pioneer round of translation, the ribosome displaces EJCs deposited 20-24 nt upstream of exon-exon junctions during splicing. If translation terminates at a PTC located >50-55 nt upstream of an EJC, the downstream EJC remains and recruits UPF1 (already present at the terminating ribosome via interaction with eRF1/eRF3). UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1, recruits SMG5/6/7, and triggers mRNA degradation through endonucleolytic cleavage (SMG6) and deadenylation-decapping. S3 is TRUE: The deadenylation-dependent decay pathway is the major mRNA degradation route in eukaryotes. The CCR4-NOT complex (containing the deadenylases CCR4/CNOT6 and CAF1/CNOT7) and the PAN2-PAN3 complex progressively shorten the poly(A) tail. S4 is FALSE: AREs (AUUUA pentamers and U-rich sequences) typically recruit DESTABILIZING proteins like tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), which recruits CCR4-NOT deadenylase, and AUF1, which promotes decay. ARE-mediated mRNA decay is a major mechanism for rapid turnover of cytokine, growth factor, and proto-oncogene mRNAs (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, c-Fos, c-Myc). While HuR can stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs, the predominant effect of AREs is destabilization, making the statement misleading.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Chromatin remodeling and histone modification represent two fundamentally different mechanisms of regulating chromatin structure: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (SWI/SNF/BAF): (1) Mechanism: The catalytic ATPase subunit (BRG1/SMARCA4 or BRM/SMARCA2 in mammalian BAF complexes) contains a split ATPase domain (DExx and HELICc lobes) that translocates along DNA within the nucleosome. This translocation creates torsional strain that propagates around the histone octamer, resulting in: nucleosome sliding (repositioning along DNA), nucleosome ejection (complete removal, creating nucleosome-free regions), and histone dimer exchange (replacing canonical H2A-H2B with variants like H2A.Z). (2) Four families of ATP-dependent remodelers exist: SWI/SNF (BAF/PBAF) \u2014 uses bromodomains to target acetylated chromatin; often opens chromatin at enhancers and promoters. ISWI (ACF, CHRAC, NURF) \u2014 uses HAND-SANT-SLIDE domains; often establishes regular nucleosome spacing. CHD (Mi-2/NuRD) \u2014 uses chromodomains to target methylated chromatin; can activate or repress. INO80/SWR1 \u2014 specialized in H2A.Z incorporation (SWR1) or removal (INO80). Histone modification (HATs/HDACs): HATs (e.g., p300/CBP, GCN5, Tip60) transfer acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to lysine \u03b5-amino groups on histone tails. This neutralizes the positive charge of lysine, weakening histone-DNA electrostatic interactions, and creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing proteins. HDACs (Class I: HDAC1-3,8; Class II: HDAC4-7,9,10; Class III: sirtuins; Class IV: HDAC11) remove acetyl groups, restoring positive charge and creating a more compact chromatin state. HDACs do not use ATP \u2014 they use zinc-dependent (Class I, II, IV) or NAD+-dependent (Class III/sirtuins) catalytic mechanisms.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "ATAC-seq reveals the landscape of open (accessible) chromatin by using the Tn5 transposase, which preferentially inserts into nucleosome-free DNA. The pattern described in this experiment reveals fundamental principles of cell-type-specific gene regulation: (1) Shared accessible regions (~30%): These correspond to: constitutive promoters of housekeeping genes (active in all cell types), insulators/CTCF boundary elements (structural), and regulatory elements for broadly expressed genes. (2) Cell-type-specific accessible regions (~70% total, split between tissues): The key observation is that these are predominantly DISTAL (>5 kb from TSSs), which is characteristic of enhancers rather than promoters. In the mammalian genome: there are ~20,000-25,000 gene promoters (mostly constitutively accessible), but ~500,000-1,000,000 potential enhancers (most are cell-type-specific). This means enhancers vastly outnumber promoters and are the primary determinants of cell identity. (3) Enhancer activation mechanism: In liver cells, liver-specific transcription factors (HNF4\u03b1, FOXA1/2, C/EBP\u03b1) bind to their cognate motifs within liver enhancers. These pioneer transcription factors (especially FOXA1/2) can bind nucleosomal DNA and recruit SWI/SNF remodelers to displace nucleosomes, creating accessible chromatin. The open enhancers then recruit p300/CBP (depositing H3K27ac), Mediator, and cohesin to form chromatin loops with target gene promoters. In brain cells, neural transcription factors (NEUROD1, BRN2, ASCL1) activate a different set of enhancers. (4) Experimental validation: Cell-type-specific ATAC-seq peaks correlate with: H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq peaks (active enhancer marks), binding sites for tissue-specific transcription factors (by motif analysis), and eQTL-associated SNPs (genetic variants affecting gene expression), confirming their regulatory function.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "HOTAIR (HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA) is a 2.2 kb lncRNA that exemplifies the scaffold function of long non-coding RNAs in epigenetic regulation: (1) Genomic context: HOTAIR is transcribed from the HOXC locus (chromosome 12 in humans) in an antisense orientation relative to the HOXC genes. It was one of the first lncRNAs shown to act in trans (regulating genes on a different chromosome). (2) Dual-scaffold mechanism (Chang and Bhatt et al., 2011): The 5' domain (first 300 nt) of HOTAIR binds PRC2 (specifically the EZH2 and SUZ12 subunits), recruiting H3K27 trimethylation activity. The 3' domain (last 646 nt) binds the LSD1 (KDM1A)/CoREST/REST complex, which contains the H3K4me1/me2 demethylase LSD1. This creates a bifunctional repressive module on a single RNA molecule: one end adds repressive marks (H3K27me3) while the other removes active marks (H3K4me2). (3) Targeting to HOXD: HOTAIR is transcribed at HOXC, exported from the transcription site, and relocates to the HOXD locus on chromosome 2. The mechanism of targeting is not fully understood but may involve RNA-DNA triplex formation, interaction with DNA-binding proteins already at HOXD, or three-dimensional genome organization bringing HOXC and HOXD into proximity. (4) Functional consequence: HOTAIR-mediated recruitment of PRC2 and LSD1 to HOXD results in H3K27me3 deposition and H3K4me2 removal across a ~40 kb domain, silencing multiple HOXD genes. This is essential for proper anterior-posterior body patterning. (5) Disease: HOTAIR overexpression in breast cancer promotes metastasis by redirecting PRC2 to tumor-suppressor gene promoters, silencing them through H3K27me3.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 5' m7G cap structure is central to eukaryotic translation initiation through the cap-dependent scanning mechanism: (1) Cap recognition: eIF4E is a 25 kDa protein that specifically binds the m7G cap through stacking interactions between two tryptophan residues (W56 and W102 in mammals) and the methylated guanine ring. eIF4E is the rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, as it is present in substoichiometric amounts relative to other initiation factors. (2) eIF4F complex assembly: eIF4E, together with eIF4G (a large scaffold protein) and eIF4A (a DEAD-box RNA helicase), forms the eIF4F complex. eIF4G bridges the cap (via eIF4E) to the 43S pre-initiation complex (40S ribosomal subunit + eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5, Met-tRNAi) via its interaction with eIF3. eIF4A unwinds secondary structures in the 5' UTR to facilitate ribosome scanning. (3) Regulation by 4E-BPs: The 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, 4E-BP3) are key translational regulators. In their hypophosphorylated state (under stress, nutrient deprivation, or mTOR inhibition), 4E-BPs bind eIF4E at the same surface used by eIF4G, competitively blocking eIF4F assembly and inhibiting cap-dependent translation. When mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) is active (growth signals, nutrients), it phosphorylates 4E-BPs on multiple sites (Thr37, Thr46, Ser65, Thr70), causing their release from eIF4E. (4) Additional cap functions: nuclear export (recognized by CBC: CBP80/CBP20), splicing stimulation, polyadenylation enhancement, and protection from 5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1 (DCP1/DCP2-mediated decapping is required before XRN1 can degrade the mRNA).",

      "explanation": "The p53-MDM2 regulatory circuit is a critical feedback loop that controls cellular responses to genotoxic stress: (1) Normal conditions: MDM2 (Mouse Double Minute 2, also called HDM2 in humans) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a RING finger domain. MDM2 binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (residues 18-26), accomplishing three things: (a) Direct inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity by masking its transactivation domain. (b) Nuclear export of p53 via MDM2's nuclear export signal. (c) Polyubiquitination of p53 (primarily K48-linked chains on C-terminal lysines K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, K386), targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. The result: p53 half-life is approximately 20 minutes under normal conditions. (2) Negative feedback loop: MDM2 is itself a transcriptional target of p53 \u2014 creating an autoregulatory negative feedback loop that maintains low p53 levels under normal conditions and enables rapid return to baseline after stress resolution. (3) DNA damage response: When DNA damage occurs (DSBs, replication stress, UV), sensor kinases are activated: ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) responds to DSBs, while ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) responds to replication stress. These kinases phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 (ATM/ATR direct) and Ser20 (via CHK1/CHK2 intermediate kinases). MDM2 is also phosphorylated at Ser395 by ATM. These phosphorylation events disrupt the p53-MDM2 interface, preventing ubiquitination. p53 half-life increases from ~20 minutes to several hours, and nuclear p53 accumulates rapidly. (4) Additional stabilization: ARF (p14ARF in humans, p19ARF in mouse) is induced by oncogenic stress (e.g., c-Myc overexpression) and sequesters MDM2 in the nucleolus, preventing it from accessing p53.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This experiment reveals the global repressive role of the Dicer-dependent small RNA pathway: (1) Dicer function: Dicer (an RNase III endoribonuclease) is the essential enzyme that processes precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into mature ~22 nt miRNA duplexes and long dsRNA into siRNAs. Without Dicer, no mature miRNAs or siRNAs are produced. (2) Why predominantly upregulation: miRNAs function primarily as post-transcriptional repressors. Each miRNA can target dozens to hundreds of mRNAs through complementary base-pairing (primarily at the seed region, positions 2-7/8 of the miRNA). The repression occurs through: (a) mRNA degradation: miRNAs recruit RISC (Argonaute + GW182/TNRC6), which recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, leading to poly(A) tail shortening and subsequent mRNA decapping and 5'-to-3' degradation by XRN1. This is the dominant mechanism in mammalian cells. (b) Translational repression: RISC can block translation initiation by interfering with eIF4F-cap interaction or by promoting ribosome drop-off. (3) Loss of Dicer removes ALL miRNAs simultaneously, de-repressing all miRNA targets \u2014 explaining the predominant upregulation (312 genes). (4) The 47 downregulated genes are likely indirect effects: some upregulated targets may be transcriptional repressors whose de-repression leads to secondary silencing of their downstream targets, or they may be stabilized by small RNA-independent mechanisms that are disrupted. (5) This experiment underscores the principle that miRNAs serve as a major layer of gene expression fine-tuning, dampening protein output to appropriate levels.

CK1alpha first phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser45 (priming phosphorylation). GSK3beta then sequentially phosphorylates Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized by the F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein), which adds K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, targeting beta-catenin for 26S proteasomal degradation.

Extensive washing removes non-specific interactions. (4) Reverse crosslinking and DNA purification: Heating at 65\u00b0C overnight reverses formaldehyde crosslinks. Proteinase K digests proteins. DNA is purified by phenol-chloroform or column purification. (5) Analysis by qPCR: Primers specific to the Gene-Y promoter are used to quantify enrichment by comparing ChIP signal to input (total chromatin) and to a negative control region (known to not bind TF-X). Enrichment > 3-5 fold over IgG control with specificity for the promoter confirms direct binding. (6) Why alternatives are insufficient: EMSA tests binding in vitro with purified protein and naked DNA \u2014 it cannot confirm that binding occurs in the chromatin context in vivo. Co-IP tests protein-protein interactions, not protein-DNA. mRNA measurement shows functional regulation but doesn't prove direct binding (could be indirect). (7) Extensions: ChIP-seq (genome-wide binding map), ChIP-exo (nucleotide resolution), CUT&RUN/CUT&Tag (lower background, fewer cells needed).",

      "explanation": "Riboswitches are cis-acting regulatory RNA elements that directly couple metabolite sensing to gene regulation without requiring any protein factors: (1) General structure: Riboswitches consist of two functional domains: the aptamer domain (highly conserved, binds the ligand with high specificity and affinity, typically Kd in nM to low \u03bcM range) and the expression platform (less conserved, undergoes conformational switching to affect gene expression). (2) TPP riboswitch specifics: The TPP (thiamine pyrophosphate, also called thiamin diphosphate) riboswitch is the most widely distributed riboswitch class, found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants. Its aptamer domain folds into a complex structure with two parallel helical arms (P2-P3 and P4-P5) connected by a junction. TPP binds in the cleft between the two arms, with the pyrimidine ring recognized by one arm and the pyrophosphate moiety coordinated by Mg2+ ions and recognized by the other arm. (3) Regulation mechanism \u2014 two modes: (a) Transcriptional attenuation: In the absence of TPP, the expression platform adopts an anti-terminator conformation, allowing RNA polymerase to read through and transcribe the full mRNA. When TPP binds, the aptamer domain restructures the expression platform into a rho-independent transcription terminator (stem-loop followed by U-rich tract), causing premature transcription termination before the coding region. (b) Translational control: In some riboswitches, TPP binding sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding site) within a base-paired structure, preventing 30S ribosomal subunit binding and translation initiation. (4) Speed and efficiency: Riboswitches operate co-transcriptionally \u2014 the decision to terminate or continue must be made within the kinetic window as RNA polymerase approaches the terminator. This means the ligand binding kinetics (kon rate), not just equilibrium binding affinity, are critical for regulation. (5) Riboswitches are considered evolutionary relics from the RNA World, when RNA molecules served as both catalysts and sensors before proteins evolved.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: This counterintuitive concept \u2014 that ubiquitination can be both activating and degradative for the same transcription factor \u2014 was discovered for several key regulators. The classic example is the yeast activator GCN4 and the mammalian estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1). For ER\u03b1: its AF-1 and AF-2 transactivation domains are required for both transcriptional activation and for recognition by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Phosphorylation by CDKs within the AF-1 domain both enhances transcriptional activity AND marks it for ubiquitin-mediated turnover. The 'licensing' model proposes that productive transcription requires a cycle of activator binding, firing (activating transcription), ubiquitination, and degradation \u2014 clearing the promoter for the next round. Blocking degradation (with proteasome inhibitors) paradoxically REDUCES transcription. S2 is TRUE: Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) and an N-terminal methionine (M1), each of which can form polyubiquitin chains with distinct topologies and functions. K48 chains adopt a compact conformation recognized by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptors (RPN10/S5a, RPN13). K63 chains adopt an extended, open conformation recognized by different effectors: in NF-\u03baB signaling, K63-linked chains on RIP1/TRAF6 serve as scaffolds to recruit the TAK1 kinase complex (via TAB2/3, which contain K63-specific ubiquitin-binding NZF domains). S3 is TRUE: The 26S proteasome (~2.5 MDa) consists of a 20S core particle (four stacked heptameric rings: \u03b17\u03b27\u03b27\u03b17, with proteolytic activities \u2014 chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like \u2014 in the \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b25 subunits) and one or two 19S regulatory particles (containing a base with six AAA-ATPase subunits RPT1-6 for substrate unfolding/translocation, and a lid with DUB activity via RPN11).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pioneer transcription factors are a specialized class of DNA-binding proteins that can initiate chromatin opening at silent loci \u2014 a critical function in cell fate determination: (1) Structural basis: FOXA1 (Forkhead box A1, originally called HNF3\u03b1) was the first characterized pioneer factor. Its forkhead/winged-helix DNA-binding domain has striking structural similarity to the globular domain of linker histone H1. Both adopt a three-helix bundle plus two wing-like loops. Key differences: while H1 binds nucleosomal DNA at the dyad axis and STABILIZES compact chromatin, FOXA1 binds a similar position but OPENS chromatin. The C-terminal domain of FOXA1 interacts with core histones H3 and H4, stabilizing its binding to nucleosomes. (2) Nucleosome engagement: FOXA1 can bind its recognition motif (TRTTKRY) even when the DNA is wrapped around a nucleosome, because its winged-helix domain makes fewer DNA contacts than many other transcription factors and those contacts can be satisfied by accessible DNA on the nucleosome surface. In contrast, most conventional transcription factors (like glucocorticoid receptor) require nucleosome-free DNA and cannot access their sites in compact chromatin. (3) Chromatin opening: Upon binding nucleosomal DNA, FOXA1: (a) Displaces linker histone H1 through competition for overlapping binding sites on the nucleosome. (b) Locally decompacts chromatin by preventing H1-mediated higher-order folding. (c) Recruits SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes to slide or evict nucleosomes. (d) Creates a locally accessible region that allows other transcription factors (settlers/conventional factors) to bind their now-exposed motifs. (4) Developmental roles: Pioneer factors are critical for cell fate transitions: FOXA1/2 in liver and pancreas development, PU.1 in hematopoiesis, OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 in pluripotency (these are the Yamanaka factors used for iPSC reprogramming), and TP63 in epidermal specification.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The EnvZ-OmpR system is the paradigm for bacterial two-component signal transduction and gene regulation: (1) Sensor kinase \u2014 EnvZ: EnvZ is an inner membrane protein with two transmembrane helices, a periplasmic sensor domain, and cytoplasmic HAMP, DHp (dimerization/histidine phosphotransfer), and CA (catalytic/ATP-binding) domains. Changes in medium osmolarity alter the conformation of the periplasmic domain, which is transmitted through the HAMP domain to regulate the kinase and phosphatase activities of the cytoplasmic domains. At high osmolarity: EnvZ kinase activity predominates \u2014 it autophosphorylates at His243 using ATP. At low osmolarity: EnvZ phosphatase activity predominates \u2014 it dephosphorylates OmpR-P. (2) Response regulator \u2014 OmpR: OmpR consists of a receiver domain (containing the conserved Asp55 that accepts the phosphoryl group from EnvZ-P) and a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. Phosphorylation at Asp55 induces a conformational change that increases OmpR's DNA-binding affinity and promotes dimerization. (3) Differential gene regulation: OmpR-P binds to multiple sites upstream of both ompC and ompF promoters, but with different affinities. At LOW OmpR-P levels (low osmolarity): OmpR-P occupies only high-affinity sites upstream of ompF, activating ompF transcription. ompC sites have lower affinity and are not occupied. Result: OmpF porins (larger pore, allows larger molecules) predominate. At HIGH OmpR-P levels (high osmolarity): High-affinity ompF sites AND lower-affinity ompC sites are both occupied. At ompF, additional OmpR-P binding at a site between the activating sites and the promoter represses ompF transcription. At ompC, the newly occupied sites activate transcription. Result: OmpC porins (smaller pore, restricts large molecules including bile salts) predominate.

        "Super-enhancers function as integrated units where individual constituent enhancers contribute synergistically rather than additively; deleting the entire super-enhancer causes near-complete loss of expression, but removing a single component has a modest effect because the remaining enhancers partially compensate, suggesting both functional redundancy and cooperative interactions among constituent elements",

        "Each enhancer in the super-enhancer independently drives 20% of expression in a purely additive manner"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This experiment illuminates the functional architecture of super-enhancers: (1) Super-enhancer definition: Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of constituent enhancer elements (typically spanning 10-50 kb) that are densely loaded with Mediator, BRD4, H3K27ac, and master transcription factors. They were defined by Young and colleagues (2013) as regions with exceptionally high levels of these marks (typically in the top 2-5% genome-wide). SEs preferentially regulate genes critical for cell identity (lineage-defining transcription factors, signaling genes) and are disproportionately sensitive to perturbation. (2) Interpreting the deletion results: Heterozygous deletion (+/\u0394): 45% reduction. If both alleles contributed equally, losing one would predict 50% reduction. The observed 45% is close, suggesting minimal trans-compensation from the remaining allele. Homozygous deletion (\u0394/\u0394): 90% reduction. Near-complete loss demonstrates the SE is the dominant regulatory element for this gene. The remaining 10% may come from the basal promoter activity or distant minor enhancers. Single constituent deletion: Only 10% reduction. This reveals: (a) No single enhancer is solely responsible. (b) Remaining enhancers partially compensate (functional redundancy). (c) The system is robust to individual perturbations \u2014 a property called regulatory buffering. (3) Synergistic vs. additive models: If the SE had 6 constituent enhancers and each contributed equally and additively, deleting one would reduce expression by ~16.7% (1/6). The observed 10% reduction is less than expected for a purely additive model, suggesting compensatory interactions. Conversely, deleting ALL of them causes 90% loss (not 100%), indicating some promoter-autonomous activity. (4) Phase separation model: Current evidence suggests SEs function through phase-separated condensates \u2014 the dense concentration of transcription factors, Mediator, and BRD4 forms liquid droplets that concentrate the transcriptional machinery. Losing one constituent reduces the condensate slightly (buffered by the remaining components), but losing the entire SE eliminates the condensate entirely (catastrophic loss).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Promoter-proximal pausing is a widespread regulatory mechanism in metazoans, affecting 30-50% of all genes, and serves as a major rate-limiting step in gene expression: (1) Establishment of pausing: After RNA Pol II clears the promoter and synthesizes 20-60 nucleotides of nascent RNA, it encounters a checkpoint established by two negative factors: NELF (Negative Elongation Factor): a four-subunit complex (NELF-A, -B, -C/D, -E) that directly contacts the nascent RNA emerging from the Pol II exit channel and the polymerase itself, inhibiting further elongation. DSIF (DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor): a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5 that associates with Pol II shortly after initiation. DSIF stabilizes the NELF-Pol II interaction and together they establish a stable paused complex. (2) Stable paused complex: The paused Pol II maintains an open promoter architecture (nucleosome-depleted region), keeping the gene in a transcription-competent state. The paused polymerase also maintains a bubble of unwound DNA (~12 bp) and holds the nascent RNA stably. This is NOT the same as promoter opening \u2014 the gene is already being transcribed, just held at a checkpoint. (3) Release by P-TEFb: The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) consists of CDK9 (a cyclin-dependent kinase) and Cyclin T1 (or T2/K). P-TEFb is recruited to paused genes by signal-responsive transcription factors, BRD4, or the super elongation complex (SEC). CDK9 phosphorylates three key substrates: (a) RNA Pol II CTD at Serine 2 of heptad repeats \u2014 this mark recruits splicing factors, the polyadenylation machinery, and histone modifiers (SET2/SETD2 for H3K36me3). (b) SPT5 subunit of DSIF \u2014 converting DSIF from a negative to a positive elongation factor that now promotes processivity. (c) NELF-E \u2014 causing NELF dissociation from the elongation complex. (4) Consequence: Pol II is released into productive elongation, moving at ~2-4 kb/min through the gene body.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "ChIP-exo represents the highest-resolution genome-wide protein-DNA binding mapping technique: (1) Standard ChIP-seq limitations: In conventional ChIP-seq, chromatin is fragmented to 200-500 bp by sonication. After immunoprecipitation, both specifically and non-specifically enriched DNA fragments are sequenced. The actual binding site is somewhere within each fragment, so resolution is limited to ~200-300 bp (determined by the average fragment size minus a modeled peak center). Even with computational peak-calling, resolution is typically 50-100 bp at best. (2) ChIP-exo principle (developed by Frank Pugh, 2011): After standard ChIP steps (crosslinking, sonication, immunoprecipitation, and stringent washing), the key innovation is treating the bead-bound, immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments with lambda exonuclease (5'-to-3' exonuclease). Lambda exonuclease digests the 5' ends of each DNA strand procissively until it reaches a physical block \u2014 the crosslinked protein or the protein-DNA interface. This trims all non-crosslinked DNA away, leaving only the DNA segment directly protected by the crosslinked protein. (3) Resolution: After exonuclease trimming, the 5' boundary of each remaining DNA fragment is within 0-5 nucleotides of the crosslink (typically at the edge of the protein-DNA contact). When millions of such trimmed fragments are sequenced and mapped, the 5' read positions cluster precisely at the borders of the binding site, creating sharp peaks that define the binding footprint at near-nucleotide resolution. (4) Advantages over ChIP-seq: 5-10x better resolution (single nucleotide vs. ~200 bp), dramatically reduced background (exonuclease removes non-specific DNA), ability to distinguish closely spaced binding events, and more accurate motif identification. (5) Related methods: CUT&RUN (uses protein A-MNase targeted by antibody to cleave DNA near binding sites, resolution ~50 bp), CUT&Tag (uses protein A-Tn5 transposase, ~50-100 bp resolution).

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Circular RNAs represent a newly appreciated class of regulatory molecules with distinct properties and functions: (1) Biogenesis: circRNAs are generated by backsplicing \u2014 a non-canonical splicing event where the 3' splice site (splice acceptor) of a downstream exon joins to the 5' splice site (splice donor) of an upstream exon, creating a covalently closed circular molecule. Backsplicing is promoted by: inverted repeat elements (Alu elements in humans) flanking the circularized exons that bring splice sites into proximity through RNA base-pairing, and RNA-binding proteins (e.g., Muscleblind, QKI) that bridge flanking introns. (2) Properties of circRNAs: Resistance to exonuclease degradation (no free 5' or 3' ends, so they are resistant to XRN1 and the exosome), resulting in high stability (half-lives of >24-48 hours vs. ~7 hours for linear mRNAs). They lack a 5' cap and poly-A tail, so they are generally not translated (with rare exceptions using IRES-mediated initiation). (3) ciRS-7/CDR1as: This circRNA is the best-characterized miRNA sponge. It is approximately 1.5 kb and is highly expressed in the mammalian brain. It contains >70 conserved binding sites for miR-7 and one binding site for miR-671. The miR-7 sites are complementary enough for RISC binding and sequestration but have central mismatches that prevent AGO2-mediated cleavage (slicing). Thus, ciRS-7 effectively titrates miR-7 away from its endogenous targets. The single miR-671 site is fully complementary and allows AGO2 cleavage, which may regulate ciRS-7 levels. (4) Functional consequence: By sponging miR-7, ciRS-7 indirectly upregulates miR-7 target genes, which include SNCA (alpha-synuclein, involved in Parkinson disease), EGFR, and IRS2. Knockout of ciRS-7 in mice causes increased miR-7 activity, reduced expression of miR-7 targets, and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

        "Notch signaling uses a MAP kinase cascade identical to the EGF receptor pathway",
        "In Notch signaling, ligand binding (Delta/Jagged) triggers sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor by ADAM10/TACE and then gamma-secretase, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) which directly translocates to the nucleus and converts the CSL/RBPJ repressor into an activator \u2014 no kinase cascade is involved",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Notch signaling is unique among major signaling pathways because the receptor itself becomes the transcriptional activator \u2014 there is no second messenger or kinase cascade: (1) Receptor structure: Notch receptors (Notch1-4 in mammals) are single-pass transmembrane proteins processed during biosynthesis by furin in the Golgi (S1 cleavage), creating a heterodimer held together by non-covalent interactions. The extracellular domain contains 29-36 EGF-like repeats and a negative regulatory region (NRR). (2) Ligand engagement: Notch ligands (Delta-like 1,3,4 and Jagged 1,2) are transmembrane proteins on adjacent cells. Ligand binding requires direct cell-cell contact (juxtacrine signaling). The ligand exerts a mechanical pulling force (endocytosis-dependent) on the Notch extracellular domain, which unfolds the NRR and exposes the S2 cleavage site. (3) Sequential proteolysis: S2 cleavage by ADAM10 (or ADAM17/TACE) in the extracellular juxtamembrane region removes most of the extracellular domain. S3 cleavage by gamma-secretase (a multi-subunit intramembrane protease complex containing Presenilin, Nicastrin, PEN-2, APH-1) cleaves within the transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). (4) Nuclear function: NICD translocates directly to the nucleus (no cytoplasmic signaling intermediates). In the nucleus, NICD binds the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL (CBF1/RBPJ in mammals, Su(H) in Drosophila, Lag-1 in C. elegans). In the absence of NICD, CSL recruits corepressors (NCoR, SMRT, HDAC) to repress target genes. NICD binding displaces corepressors and recruits the coactivator Mastermind (MAML1) and p300, converting CSL into a transcriptional activator. (5) Target genes: HES1/HES5, HEY1/HEY2 (bHLH transcriptional repressors), MYC, and cell-type-specific targets controlling proliferation and differentiation.",

      "question": "Heterochromatin spreading is prevented by boundary elements that establish sharp transitions between active and silent chromatin. In budding yeast, the SIR (Silent Information Regulator) silencing complex spreads along chromatin from silencer elements. What prevents unlimited SIR spreading?",
      "options": [
        "SIR spreading is unlimited and always covers entire chromosomes",
        "SIR proteins have an inherent distance limit and automatically stop after spreading 5 kb",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The mechanisms preventing heterochromatin spreading in S. cerevisiae reveal fundamental principles of chromatin boundary function: (1) SIR silencing complex: SIR2 (NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase/sirtuin), SIR3 (chromodomain-containing structural protein), and SIR4 (bridges to SIR1 at silencers and to Rap1/ORC at telomeres) form the core silencing machinery. The spreading mechanism is: SIR2 deacetylates H4K16ac on a nucleosome \u2192 deacetylated H4K16 creates a binding surface for SIR3 \u2192 SIR3 binding recruits more SIR2 (via SIR4 bridging) to deacetylate the adjacent nucleosome \u2192 iterative spreading. (2) H4K16 acetylation boundary: The histone acetyltransferase Sas2 (part of the SAS-I complex) acetylates H4K16 at euchromatin-heterochromatin boundaries. This creates an ongoing competition: SIR2 removes H4K16ac (promoting SIR3 binding and further spreading), while Sas2 adds H4K16ac (blocking SIR3 binding and halting spreading). At steady state, this tug-of-war creates a sharp boundary. Deletion of SAS2 causes promiscuous SIR spreading into euchromatin, silencing genes that should be active. (3) H2A.Z (Htz1) boundary: The histone variant H2A.Z (encoded by HTZ1) is enriched at chromatin boundaries and active gene promoters. H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are biochemically incompatible with SIR complex association \u2014 SIR3 binds poorly to H2A.Z nucleosomes. Deletion of HTZ1 causes heterochromatin spreading at telomeres and HM loci, silencing neighboring genes. (4) Active transcription: Ongoing transcription by RNA Pol II can also counteract heterochromatin spreading by displacing SIR proteins during polymerase passage, recruiting HATs that acetylate histones, and incorporating H2A.Z via the SWR1 remodeling complex at promoters.",

Head module contacts RNA Pol II CTD and TFIIH. Middle module connects head to tail. Tail module is the primary interface for gene-specific activators (e.g., nuclear receptors bind MED1 via LXXLL motifs). CDK module (CDK8/CycC/MED12/MED13) reversibly associates for additional regulation. (2) Enhancer-promoter bridging: Transcription factors at enhancers recruit Mediator through tail subunits. Mediator bridges to the PIC at the promoter, stabilizing TFIID-TFIIA-TFIIB-Pol II assembly. (3) Signal integration: Different activators contact different subunits. The CDK8 module can phosphorylate activators and TFIIH.

Instead, they pass through intermediate states where: old transcription factor programs are being actively downregulated (through proteasomal degradation of master TFs, miRNA-mediated mRNA turnover, and epigenetic silencing of progenitor enhancers), while new lineage-specific programs are being activated (through pioneer factor binding, enhancer activation, and new TF network establishment).

AHL binding stabilizes LuxR (which is otherwise rapidly degraded) and promotes dimerization. (4) Gene activation: LuxR-AHL dimers bind a 20-bp palindromic sequence (lux box) upstream of the luxICDABE operon, activating transcription. The operon encodes: luxA/B (luciferase alpha and beta subunits), luxC/D/E (fatty acid reductase complex that generates the aldehyde substrate), and luxI (positive feedback \u2014 more autoinducer synthesis). (5) Positive feedback: Induced luxI expression creates more AHL, further stimulating the system and neighboring cells \u2014 creating a rapid, synchronized population-wide response once threshold is reached. (6) Biological significance: V. fischeri lives symbiotically in the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes). Bioluminescence is only useful at high cell density (enough light for the squid's counter-illumination camouflage). The quorum sensing system ensures energy-expensive light production occurs only when the population is dense enough in the light organ.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "CUT&RUN (developed by Steven Henikoff, 2017) represents a major improvement over traditional ChIP-seq: (1) Principle: Instead of fragmenting ALL chromatin by sonication (ChIP-seq) and then immunoprecipitating the target (creating high background from non-specific chromatin), CUT&RUN cuts ONLY at antibody-bound sites, releasing small target fragments into the supernatant while bulk chromatin remains intact in the nucleus. (2) Protocol: Cells are bound to Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads. Primary antibody against the target protein is added and binds in situ. Protein A-MNase (pA-MNase) fusion protein is added, binding the antibody's Fc region. After washing, calcium is added to activate MNase, which cleaves DNA immediately surrounding the antibody-bound site (typically generating ~150 bp fragments). Released fragments diffuse out of the nucleus into the supernatant and are collected. (3) Advantages over ChIP-seq: (a) Much lower background (only target-proximal DNA is released, while bulk chromatin stays in nuclei). (b) Requires far fewer cells (100-1,000 cells vs. millions for ChIP-seq). (c) No formaldehyde crosslinking needed (native conditions). (d) No sonication (avoids epitope masking and artifactual DNA fragmentation). (e) Lower sequencing depth required (~5-8 million reads vs. 20-50 million for ChIP-seq). (4) CUT&Tag variation: uses protein A-Tn5 transposase instead of pA-MNase, directly tagmenting (fragmenting and adaptor-tagging) DNA near the target site, further streamlining library preparation. Even fewer cells needed (single-cell CUT&Tag is possible). (5) Limitations: less suitable for proteins with very transient DNA interactions (may benefit from light crosslinking), and pA-MNase has some non-specific DNA cutting activity.",

      "options": [
        "Paramutation involves physical deletion of one allele by the other",
        "Paramutation is caused by transposon insertion that disrupts the gene sequence",
        "In paramutation, the silenced allele (B') can convert the active allele (B-I) to the silenced state when they are brought together in a heterozygote; the newly silenced allele remains silenced even after segregation and can itself silence active alleles in subsequent crosses \u2014 violating Mendel's law that alleles emerge unchanged from heterozygotes",
        "Paramutation is a type of incomplete dominance where both alleles are expressed at intermediate levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Paramutation challenges fundamental Mendelian principles by demonstrating allele-allele interactions that alter heritable gene expression: (1) The b1 locus in maize: B-I (intensely colored, highly expressed, paramutable) and B' (lightly pigmented, low expression, paramutagenic) are epialleles \u2014 they have IDENTICAL DNA sequences but different expression states maintained by epigenetic marks. (2) The cross: When B-I/B' heterozygotes are created, B' ALWAYS converts B-I to the B' state. The converted allele (now called B'*) is stably silenced. Remarkably, B'* then itself becomes paramutagenic \u2014 capable of silencing other B-I alleles in subsequent generations. This means 100% of progeny from a B-I/B' cross exhibit the B' phenotype, violating the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio. (3) Mechanism: The paramutagenic B' allele generates 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from tandem repeat sequences located ~100 kb upstream of the b1 coding region. These siRNAs direct RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) at the corresponding sequences on the B-I allele, establishing cytosine methylation (CG, CHG, CHH contexts) and repressive histone modifications (H3K9me2, H3K27me2). (4) Required genes: mop1 (encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RDR2 homolog needed for siRNA biogenesis), mop2 (encodes a subunit of RNA Pol IV, needed for siRNA precursor transcription), and rmr6 (encodes the largest subunit of RNA Pol IV). These are all components of the plant RdDM pathway. (5) Significance: Paramutation demonstrates that epigenetic states can be transmitted through meiosis and can spread between alleles, implying that the genome is not a static instruction set but can be dynamically modified by regulatory interactions between homologous sequences.",

      "options": [
        "In the absence of cortisol, GR is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the Hsp90/Hsp70 chaperone complex which maintains GR in a ligand-binding-competent conformation; cortisol binding induces a conformational change that exposes a nuclear localization signal, causes dissociation from chaperones, and allows GR dimerization, nuclear translocation, and binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) to activate or repress target genes",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The glucocorticoid receptor exemplifies the class I nuclear receptor activation mechanism: (1) Inactive state: Unliganded GR resides in the cytoplasm bound to a chaperone complex consisting of Hsp90 (dimer), Hsp70, p23, and immunophilins (FKBP51, FKBP52). This complex serves two purposes: it maintains the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in an open, ligand-receptive conformation (without Hsp90, the LBD collapses and cannot bind cortisol), and it masks the nuclear localization signal (NLS), preventing premature nuclear entry. (2) Ligand binding: Cortisol (a glucocorticoid steroid hormone) is lipophilic and crosses the cell membrane by passive diffusion. It enters the Hsp90-maintained binding pocket of GR. Cortisol binding induces a conformational change: helix 12 (the AF-2 helix) of the LBD repositions to create a coactivator-binding surface, and the chaperone complex dissociates. (3) Nuclear translocation: The exposed NLS is recognized by importin alpha/beta, and GR is actively transported through nuclear pore complexes. FKBP52 (an immunophilin with PPIase activity) facilitates transport along cytoplasmic dynein-microtubule tracks. (4) DNA binding: In the nucleus, GR binds as a homodimer to GREs (Glucocorticoid Response Elements, consensus: AGAACAnnnTGTTCT, a palindromic hexamer with 3 bp spacer) through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain (two C4-type zinc fingers). (5) Transcriptional activation: GR recruits coactivators (SRC-1/NCoA-1, SRC-2/GRIP1, SRC-3/ACTR) through LXXLL motifs binding the AF-2 surface. Coactivators recruit p300/CBP (HAT) and Mediator. (6) Trans-repression: GR can also repress genes (anti-inflammatory effect) by tethering to AP-1 or NF-kB without direct DNA binding (tethering mechanism), or by competing for shared coactivators (squelching).",

      "explanation": "RNA-directed DNA methylation is unique to plants and involves two plant-specific RNA polymerases: (1) Pol IV: A plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that evolved from Pol II. It transcribes single-stranded RNA from target loci (transposons, repetitive elements, some genes). These Pol IV transcripts are converted to double-stranded RNA by RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2). The dsRNA is processed by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) into 24-nt siRNAs. (2) siRNA loading: The 24-nt siRNAs are methylated at the 3' end by HEN1 (to prevent degradation) and loaded into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4). (3) Pol V: Another plant-specific RNA polymerase that produces non-coding scaffold transcripts from the target loci. These scaffold transcripts remain associated with chromatin. The AGO4-siRNA complex base-pairs with the complementary Pol V scaffold transcript at the target locus. (4) DRM2 recruitment: AGO4 interacts with the C-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit (NRPE1), and with DRM2 (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2), a de novo DNA methyltransferase homologous to mammalian DNMT3. DRM2 methylates cytosines in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H = A, T, or C). (5) Maintenance: CG methylation is maintained by MET1 (DNMT1 homolog). CHG methylation is maintained through a reinforcing loop between CMT3 (CHROMOMETHYLASE 3, reads H3K9me2) and SUVH4/KYP (H3K9 methyltransferase, reads CHG methylation). CHH methylation requires continuous RdDM. (6) Biological function: RdDM is critical for silencing transposable elements, maintaining genome stability, and paramutation.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Transcriptional condensates represent a paradigm shift in understanding gene regulation: (1) Intrinsically disordered regions: Many transcription factors contain large IDRs that lack stable secondary/tertiary structure in isolation. These regions are enriched in specific amino acid residues: low-complexity sequences (polyQ, polyN, G-rich), aromatic residues (forming pi-pi and cation-pi interactions), and charged residues (forming electrostatic interactions). (2) Phase separation: IDRs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) when their concentration exceeds a threshold, forming condensed liquid droplets (coacervates). The driving forces are multivalent weak interactions between IDR chains \u2014 each interaction is weak individually, but many simultaneous interactions create a collective phase transition. (3) Transcriptional condensates at super-enhancers: Transcription factors with IDR activation domains (e.g., OCT4, GCN4, EWS-FLI1), Mediator (MED1 IDR), BRD4, and RNA Pol II CTD (52 heptad repeats, the largest IDR in the transcription machinery) can all undergo LLPS. At super-enhancers, these components co-condense into hubs that concentrate the transcriptional machinery far above cytoplasmic/nucleoplasmic concentrations. (4) Functional consequences: Enhanced transcription of cell identity genes driven by super-enhancers. Sharp ON/OFF transcriptional responses (phase transitions are cooperative). Sensitivity to perturbation (condensates can dissolve rapidly with small changes in concentration or modification state \u2014 e.g., CTD phosphorylation by CDK7/9 can dissolve transcription initiation condensates). (5) CTD phosphorylation switch: Unphosphorylated Pol II CTD partitions into Mediator condensates (initiation phase). CDK7 phosphorylation at Ser5 triggers Pol II transfer to splicing factor condensates. CDK9 phosphorylation at Ser2 drives Pol II into elongation/splicing condensates.

      "explanation": "Identifying the specific HDAC requires systematic individual perturbation: (1) The challenge: There are 18 HDAC enzymes in humans across 4 classes \u2014 Class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8), Class IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9), Class IIb (HDAC6, 10), Class III/sirtuins (SIRT1-7), and Class IV (HDAC11). Most pharmacological HDAC inhibitors (SAHA/vorinostat, TSA) inhibit multiple Class I/II HDACs non-selectively, making it impossible to identify the specific enzyme. (2) siRNA knockdown screen: Individual siRNAs targeting each HDAC allow specific, one-at-a-time depletion. If knocking down HDAC-X reactivates the tumor suppressor (measured by RT-qPCR), HDAC-X is a candidate. Multiple siRNAs per gene (at least 3-4) are essential to rule out off-target effects (if 3/4 siRNAs against HDAC-X show reactivation, it's unlikely to be off-target). (3) Validation: ChIP-qPCR with anti-HDAC-X antibody at the tumor suppressor promoter confirms that HDAC-X is physically present at the gene. If enriched in silent cells but not in reactivated cells (after HDAC-X knockdown), this provides direct evidence of promoter-specific HDAC-X recruitment. (4) Additional validation: CRISPR knockout of HDAC-X (permanent), rescue experiment (re-express HDAC-X in KO cells to re-silence the gene), and catalytic-dead mutant (confirms the deacetylase activity is required). (5) Why alternatives fail: Pan-HDAC inhibitors cannot distinguish between HDACs. Total HDAC activity assays measure global activity, not gene-specific effects.

        "Hox genes are randomly expressed and their position in the cluster has no relationship to body axis patterning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Hox gene collinearity is one of the most remarkable examples of the relationship between genome organization and gene regulation: (1) Collinearity principle: In the four mammalian Hox clusters (HoxA-D), genes at the 3' end (e.g., Hox1-4) are expressed in anterior/rostral body segments, while genes at the 5' end (e.g., Hox9-13) are expressed in posterior/caudal segments. The spatial expression domain along the body axis mirrors the physical gene order on the chromosome. (2) Temporal collinearity: During development, 3' genes are also activated earlier than 5' genes, mirroring the temporal sequence of segment formation. (3) Chromatin mechanism: In undifferentiated cells, the entire Hox cluster is coated with H3K27me3 (deposited by PRC2) and is transcriptionally silent. As development proceeds, chromatin remodeling progresses from 3' to 5': H3K27me3 is removed (by UTX/KDM6A demethylase recruited by retinoic acid signaling for 3' genes, or by FGF/Wnt signaling for 5' genes). Active marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) are deposited. Transcription initiates. This creates a sharp boundary between active (H3K4me3) and silent (H3K27me3) chromatin that moves progressively from 3' to 5' along the cluster. (4) Topological regulation: The HoxD cluster in mice lies at the boundary between two Topologically Associating Domains (TADs): a telomeric TAD containing distal limb enhancers (digits) and a centromeric TAD containing proximal limb enhancers (forearm). 5' HoxD genes are regulated by telomeric enhancers (digit expression), while 3' genes are regulated by centromeric enhancers. CTCF boundaries within the cluster control which enhancers access which genes. (5) Posterior prevalence: When Hox genes from different positions are co-expressed in the same segment, posterior (5') genes functionally dominate over anterior (3') genes \u2014 a phenomenon called posterior prevalence or phenotypic suppression.",

      "options": [
        "eRNAs are thought to stabilize enhancer-promoter chromatin loops by interacting with Mediator and cohesin complexes, facilitate Pol II pause release at target gene promoters by stimulating P-TEFb activity, and may trap transcription factors at enhancers through RNA-protein interactions, thereby reinforcing enhancer activation",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Enhancer RNAs represent an active area of research in gene regulation: (1) Discovery: eRNAs were identified through GRO-seq (Global Run-On sequencing) and PRO-seq (Precision Run-On sequencing), which detect nascent transcription. Active enhancers produce bidirectional, short (0.5-2 kb), unstable, non-polyadenylated transcripts \u2014 eRNAs. eRNA production correlates strongly with enhancer activity and target gene expression. (2) Proposed functions: (a) Chromatin loop stabilization: eRNAs interact with the cohesin complex (specifically the RAD21/SCC1 subunit) and Mediator, potentially stabilizing enhancer-promoter chromatin loops formed by the loop extrusion mechanism. Degradation of eRNAs (by targeted RNase H or CRISPRi) reduces enhancer-promoter contacts measured by chromosome conformation capture. (b) P-TEFb activation: Some eRNAs directly interact with the NELF (Negative Elongation Factor) complex at target gene promoters, facilitating NELF release and promoting the transition from paused to productively elongating RNA Pol II. BRD4, which recruits P-TEFb, can also bind eRNAs. (c) Transcription factor trapping: eRNAs can interact with transcription factors (e.g., YY1) at enhancers, increasing their local residence time and enhancing their regulatory activity through a kinetic trapping mechanism. (3) Evidence for functionality: Degradation of specific eRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or LNA gapmers reduces target gene expression without affecting enhancer chromatin marks. CRISPRi-mediated silencing of eRNA transcription (but not the enhancer itself) can reduce target gene activation. Insertion of transcription terminators at enhancers (blocking eRNA elongation but not enhancer identity) partially reduces target gene expression. (4) Caveats: The act of eRNA transcription (chromatin remodeling during Pol II passage) may be more important than the eRNA molecule itself \u2014 separating these two contributions remains challenging.",

        "piRNAs are processed from double-stranded RNA by Dicer just like siRNAs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The piRNA pathway is a germline-specific defense against transposable elements: (1) piRNA characteristics: 24-31 nt (longer than miRNAs ~22 nt and siRNAs ~21 nt), 2'-O-methylated at the 3' end (by HEN1/HENMT1), strong bias for 5' uridine (1U), and associated with PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins (MIWI, MILI, MIWI2 in mouse; Piwi, Aubergine, AGO3 in Drosophila). (2) Biogenesis \u2014 Dicer-independent: piRNAs are transcribed from genomic piRNA clusters (often in pericentromeric regions enriched for transposon fragments) as long single-stranded precursors by RNA Pol II. These precursors are processed by the endonuclease Zucchini/MitoPLD (a phospholipase D family nuclease) into piRNA intermediates that are loaded into PIWI proteins and trimmed to mature length by a 3'-to-5' exonuclease. NO Dicer is involved at any step. (3) Ping-pong amplification cycle: Primary piRNAs (antisense to transposons, loaded into Piwi/Aubergine) guide cleavage of active transposon mRNAs. The cleavage products are loaded into AGO3 as secondary piRNAs (sense strand, 10A bias \u2014 the 10th nucleotide is almost always adenine, complementary to the 1U of the primary piRNA). AGO3-bound sense piRNAs then guide cleavage of piRNA cluster transcripts, generating more antisense piRNAs. This reciprocal cleavage cycle amplifies the piRNA pool and directly destroys transposon mRNAs. (4) Transcriptional silencing: In the nucleus, PIWI-piRNA complexes also direct de novo DNA methylation at transposon loci (in mammals) or H3K9me3 deposition (in Drosophila), establishing long-term transcriptional silencing.

        "The first pattern represents genes being repressed by Pol II binding while the second shows normal transcription"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "ChIP-seq profiles of RNA Pol II reveal the kinetic state of transcription: (1) Promoter-paused genes (high pausing index): After initiation, Pol II transcribes 20-60 nt and then pauses due to NELF and DSIF. At promoter-paused genes, the rate-limiting step is pause release (not initiation). Pol II accumulates at the promoter, creating a strong ChIP-seq peak at the TSS with minimal gene body signal. The pausing index (PI) = Pol II density at promoter / Pol II density in gene body. High PI (>4) indicates a paused gene. Examples: many developmental genes, stress-response genes (e.g., heat shock genes in uninduced state). (2) Actively elongating genes (low pausing index): At genes where pause release is not rate-limiting (constitutively active genes, genes stimulated by P-TEFb), Pol II is distributed along the gene body. The signal typically shows a 5'-to-3' gradient because: Pol II density decreases as some polymerases terminate or fall off, and the accumulation of modifications (Ser2P-CTD, H3K36me3) changes along the gene body. Low PI (<2) indicates efficient elongation. Examples: housekeeping genes, ribosomal protein genes. (3) Traveling ratio: An alternative metric calculated similarly to PI. A traveling ratio close to 1 indicates uniform Pol II distribution (efficient elongation), while a high ratio indicates pausing. (4) Functional significance: Pausing serves as a checkpoint for: rapid signal-responsive gene induction (pre-loaded Pol II needs only release), quality control of early elongation, and integration of multiple regulatory signals at the pause-release step. (5) Global analyses show that 30-50% of human genes have significant promoter-proximal pausing, making it a major gene regulatory mechanism.",

      "options": [
        "NATs only function by encoding proteins that regulate the sense gene",
        "NATs can regulate sense gene expression through multiple mechanisms: transcriptional interference (collision between converging RNA polymerases), chromatin remodeling (antisense transcription recruits repressive histone modifications to the sense promoter), dsRNA formation (sense-antisense hybrids trigger RNAi or editing by ADAR), and transcription factor competition (for shared enhancers or transcription machinery)",

        "Antisense transcription occurs only in bacteria and not in eukaryotes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Natural antisense transcription is a widespread gene regulatory mechanism: (1) Prevalence: In the human genome, approximately 70% of annotated genes have evidence of antisense transcription. NATs can be cis-NATs (overlapping the sense gene) or trans-NATs (from a different locus). (2) Transcriptional interference: When sense and antisense promoters drive converging RNA polymerases toward each other, head-on collisions can occur. The colliding polymerases stall and dissociate, reducing transcription from both directions. The stronger promoter typically wins this competition. In yeast, the GAL10-GAL7 convergent gene pair demonstrates this principle. (3) Chromatin remodeling: Antisense transcription through a sense gene promoter can recruit repressive chromatin modifiers. Example: At the yeast PHO84 gene, antisense transcription recruits the HDAC complex Rpd3L, which deacetylates histones at the PHO84 promoter, silencing it during aging. In mammals, antisense transcription from the Airn lncRNA through the Igf2r promoter recruits G9a methyltransferase (H3K9me2), silencing Igf2r on the paternal allele (imprinting). (4) dsRNA formation: Sense and antisense transcripts can hybridize in cis (forming dsRNA regions), which can trigger: Dicer-mediated processing into endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs, particularly in oocytes and ESCs), or ADAR-mediated A-to-I RNA editing (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA converts A to inosine in dsRNA). (5) Transcription factor competition: Sense and antisense promoters may compete for shared regulatory elements (enhancers, transcription factors) in a zero-sum manner, creating mutually exclusive expression patterns. (6) Examples in human disease: BACE1-AS antisense transcript stabilizes BACE1 mRNA in Alzheimer's disease. ANRIL antisense lncRNA at the INK4 locus regulates p15/CDKN2B expression and is associated with cardiovascular disease risk.",

      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: The stringent response (discovered by Cashel and Gallant) enables bacteria to rapidly reprogram gene expression during amino acid starvation. When uncharged tRNA enters the ribosomal A site (unable to deliver an amino acid), the ribosome-associated enzyme RelA (ppGpp synthetase I) is activated. RelA catalyzes the pyrophosphoryl transfer from ATP to GTP, producing pppGpp, which is rapidly converted to ppGpp by the GppA hydrolase. ppGpp (together with its cofactor DksA) binds directly to two sites on RNA polymerase: site 1 (between the beta' and omega subunits) and site 2 (in the secondary channel). ppGpp-DksA-RNAP: (a) INHIBITS transcription of rRNA/tRNA genes (by destabilizing open complexes at these promoters, which have inherently unstable open complexes due to GC-rich discriminator sequences), and (b) ACTIVATES transcription of amino acid biosynthesis genes (by redistributing RNAP from rRNA operons to these promoters, and by directly stimulating open complex formation at promoters with AT-rich discriminators). S2 TRUE: As detailed in the lac operon question. Low glucose \u2192 high cAMP \u2192 CAP-cAMP activates alternative carbon source operons. This is more accurately called carbon catabolite repression (CCR). S3 TRUE: Under normal conditions, sigma-32 is maintained at very low levels through: rapid degradation by FtsH protease (half-life ~1 min at 30C), translational repression (sigma-32 mRNA secondary structure blocks ribosome binding at 30C), and sequestration by DnaK/DnaJ chaperones. Upon heat shock: DnaK/DnaJ are titrated away by unfolded proteins, releasing sigma-32. sigma-32 mRNA secondary structure melts at high temperature, enhancing translation. FtsH-mediated degradation is temporarily reduced. sigma-32 levels increase rapidly, it competes with sigma-70 for core RNA polymerase, and directs RNAP to heat shock gene promoters (consensus: CTTGAA-N13-15-CCCCAT).

      "explanation": "The canonical NF-kB pathway is one of the most extensively studied signal transduction cascades: (1) Inactive state: The prototypical NF-kB dimer (p65/RelA - p50) is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Inhibitor of kB proteins (IkB\u03b1, IkB\u03b2, IkB\u03b5). IkB proteins contain ankyrin repeat domains that mask the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NF-kB, preventing nuclear import. The p65/p50 heterodimer is the most common form, but many combinations exist (p65, RelB, c-Rel with p50 or p52). (2) Signal reception: Diverse stimuli activate the pathway: pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 binds TNFR1, IL-1 binds IL-1R), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (LPS binds TLR4, viral RNA binds TLR3/7/8), antigen receptors (TCR, BCR), and DNA damage (ATM-dependent nuclear signaling). (3) IKK activation: Signals converge on the IKK complex: IKK\u03b1 (IKK1) and IKK\u03b2 (IKK2) are the catalytic kinase subunits, and NEMO (NF-kB Essential Modulator/IKK\u03b3) is the regulatory subunit. In the canonical pathway, IKK\u03b2 is the critical kinase. K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on upstream adaptors (RIP1, TRAF2/6) serve as scaffolds to recruit TAK1 kinase (via TAB2/3) and the IKK complex (via NEMO's ubiquitin-binding domain). TAK1 phosphorylates and activates IKK\u03b2. (4) IkB degradation: Activated IKK\u03b2 phosphorylates IkB\u03b1 at Ser32 and Ser36. Phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 is recognized by the SCF-\u03b2TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which adds K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, targeting IkB\u03b1 for rapid proteasomal degradation (half-life drops from hours to minutes). (5) Nuclear translocation and gene activation: Freed NF-kB (NLS exposed) enters the nucleus via importin \u03b1/\u03b2.

Important: NOT all binding events are functional \u2014 some may be non-productive. (2) Acute RNA-seq time course: Treatment with hormone for short time points (30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr) captures: Primary/direct targets (respond within 1-2 hours, before secondary transcriptional cascades), distinguishes activated vs. repressed targets, and provides temporal resolution (earliest responding genes are most likely direct). Longer time points (24-48 hr) capture many indirect/secondary effects, making it impossible to distinguish direct from indirect targets.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Position-effect variegation is a classic demonstration of heterochromatin spreading and stochastic gene silencing: (1) The phenomenon: When a euchromatic gene (e.g., the white gene controlling eye color in Drosophila) is placed adjacent to pericentric heterochromatin by chromosomal inversion or translocation, it shows mosaic expression \u2014 some ommatidia (eye facets) are red (gene active) and others are white (gene silenced). (2) Mechanism: During early embryonic development, heterochromatin domains are established and can spread linearly along the chromosome into adjacent sequences. The distance of spreading is stochastic \u2014 varying from cell to cell. If spreading reaches the relocated gene in a particular cell: H3K9me3 (deposited by SU(VAR)3-9 methyltransferase), HP1 binding (SU(VAR)2-5), and histone deacetylation compact the region, silencing the gene. If spreading stops before reaching the gene: the gene remains in an active euchromatic state. (3) Clonal inheritance: Once the epigenetic state (active or silent) is established in a cell during early development, it is faithfully maintained through all subsequent cell divisions. This creates clonal patches of cells \u2014 all descendants of a cell where the gene was silenced show the mutant phenotype, while descendants of cells where it remained active show wild-type phenotype. (4) Genetic modifiers: Suppressors of PEV [Su(var)]: loss-of-function mutations that reduce silencing. SU(VAR)3-9 (H3K9 methyltransferase), SU(VAR)2-5 (HP1), and HDAC genes are su(var) when mutated. Enhancers of PEV [E(var)]: mutations that increase silencing. Trithorax group genes (TRX/MLL, ASH1) are e(var) when mutated.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "iPSC reprogramming (Yamanaka, Nobel Prize 2012) requires extensive epigenetic remodeling: (1) Somatic epigenetic barriers: In differentiated cells (e.g., fibroblasts), pluripotency genes (NANOG, OCT4/POU5F1 itself, REX1, DPPA3) are silenced by multiple layers: DNA methylation at CpG-rich promoters (maintained by DNMT1), H3K9me3 deposited by SETDB1 and G9a (creating HP1-bound heterochromatin), and H3K27me3 deposited by PRC2. Simultaneously, lineage-specific genes are in an active state with open chromatin, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and active enhancers. (2) Pioneer factor activity: OCT4 and SOX2 function as pioneer transcription factors that can engage their binding motifs on nucleosomal DNA. They initiate chromatin opening at closed pluripotency gene regulatory elements. KLF4 cooperates by binding accessible regions first and facilitating OCT4/SOX2 binding at less accessible sites. c-MYC is not essential for reprogramming but dramatically increases efficiency \u2014 it acts as a general transcription amplifier and chromatin opener (recruiting HATs, especially through the MAX-interacting network). (3) Epigenetic remodeling sequence: Early: c-MYC drives global chromatin opening. Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) occurs. Mid: OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 gradually activate pluripotency genes. TET enzymes (TET1/2) begin demethylating pluripotency gene promoters (5mC \u2192 5hmC \u2192 5fC \u2192 5caC \u2192 C). Somatic enhancers are decommissioned (loss of H3K4me1, H3K27ac). Late: Complete activation of the pluripotency gene regulatory network. Telomere elongation by telomerase (TERT reactivation). X chromosome reactivation (in female cells). (4) Rate-limiting barriers: H3K9me3 at core pluripotency loci is the most significant barrier. Knockdown of H3K9 methyltransferases (SETDB1, SUV39H1) dramatically increases reprogramming efficiency. DNA methylation at the OCT4 and NANOG promoters must be actively removed for stable reprogramming. (5) Incomplete reprogramming: Partially reprogrammed cells (pre-iPSCs) often fail at the H3K9me3/DNA methylation barrier, remaining stuck in an intermediate state with some but not all pluripotency genes activated.",

      "question": "A lab uses CRISPR to mutate a CTCF binding site at a TAD boundary between two genes: Gene-A (in TAD-1, regulated by Enhancer-A in TAD-1) and Gene-B (in TAD-2, regulated by Enhancer-B in TAD-2). After CTCF site mutation, they observe that Gene-B expression increases 15-fold while Gene-A expression decreases 3-fold. Enhancer-A is located 50 kb from Gene-A and 100 kb from Gene-B (on the other side of the former boundary). What mechanism explains these expression changes?",
      "options": [
        "The CTCF mutation directly creates a new promoter that drives Gene-B expression",
        "Disrupting the CTCF-mediated TAD boundary allows Enhancer-A to now access Gene-B in the adjacent TAD (enhancer hijacking/adoption), inappropriately activating Gene-B; Gene-A expression decreases because Enhancer-A's activity is now partially diverted to Gene-B instead of being exclusively directed to Gene-A",
        "Gene-B has a copy number amplification caused by the CRISPR editing",
        "The expression changes are unrelated to the boundary disruption and are caused by off-target CRISPR effects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This experiment demonstrates the critical insulator function of TAD boundaries: (1) Normal state: The CTCF-cohesin boundary between TAD-1 and TAD-2 creates an insulated neighborhood. Enhancer-A in TAD-1 can loop to and activate Gene-A (same TAD) but is blocked from accessing Gene-B (different TAD) by the boundary. Similarly, Enhancer-B activates Gene-B within TAD-2. Each enhancer-promoter pair operates independently within its TAD. (2) Boundary disruption: Mutating the convergent CTCF binding site eliminates the cohesin extrusion barrier. The former TAD-1 and TAD-2 merge into a single larger domain. Now Enhancer-A can form chromatin loops with Gene-B (enhancer hijacking/adoption). (3) Gene-B upregulation (15-fold): Enhancer-A, which was previously insulated from Gene-B, now gains access. Gene-B receives enhancer activation it normally never experiences. The 15-fold activation indicates Enhancer-A is a strong enhancer. Gene-B is also still activated by its own Enhancer-B, potentially receiving combinatorial activation. (4) Gene-A downregulation (3-fold): Enhancer-A's activity is now shared between Gene-A and Gene-B. The enhancer has a finite activation capacity (limited concentration of Mediator, TFs, and coactivators that it can load). When some of this activity is diverted to Gene-B, Gene-A receives less. The 3-fold decrease (rather than 50%) may reflect that Gene-A still receives most of Enhancer-A's output due to proximity, but some is lost to Gene-B. (5) Disease relevance: TAD boundary disruption causes developmental disorders and cancer through enhancer hijacking. Examples: AML (disruption of CTCF boundary allows a super-enhancer to activate the EVI1 oncogene), limb malformations (boundary disruptions at the WNT6/IHH/EPHA4 locus cause misexpression), and medulloblastoma (GFI1/GFI1B activation by hijacked enhancers after structural variants).",

Five phosphorylatable residues per repeat: Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5, Ser7. (2) CTD code \u2014 the transcription cycle: Pre-initiation: Unphosphorylated CTD is required for Pol II recruitment to the promoter (via Mediator interaction). Mediator binds unphosphorylated CTD through its head module. Initiation: TFIIH subunit CDK7 (with Cyclin H) phosphorylates Ser5 (and Ser7). Ser5P recruits: the capping enzyme (guanylyltransferase, which adds the m7G cap to the nascent RNA 5' end), the SET1/MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complex (depositing H3K4me3 at promoters), and the Integrator complex. Ser5P also triggers Mediator release, allowing Pol II to escape the promoter. Pause/release: NELF and DSIF establish the pause. P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T) phosphorylates Ser2. Elongation: Ser2P accumulates as Pol II moves through the gene body, while Ser5P is gradually removed by the phosphatases Rtr1/RPAP2 and Ssu72. Ser2P recruits: the SETD2 methyltransferase (deposits H3K36me3 in gene bodies), splicing factors (SR proteins, U2AF), the FACT histone chaperone, and elongation factors (SPT6, PAF1 complex). Termination: High Ser2P near the 3' end recruits the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CstF). After poly(A) signal recognition and mRNA cleavage, the torpedo RNase XRN2/Rat1 degrades the remaining RNA still associated with Pol II, leading to polymerase release.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Dosage compensation has evolved independently with remarkably different strategies: (1) Drosophila \u2014 male hypertranscription: Males (XY) have one X chromosome while females (XX) have two. Instead of silencing one female X, Drosophila UPREGULATES the single male X approximately 2-fold. The MSL complex (Male-Specific Lethal: MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF/KAT8, MLE helicase, and two non-coding RNAs roX1/roX2) is assembled only in males (MSL2 expression is repressed in females by Sex-lethal protein). The MSL complex binds high-affinity sites (HAS/CES, ~35 sites) on the male X chromosome and then spreads to active genes through a combination of H3K36me3 recognition (by the chromodomain of MSL3) and transcription-coupled spreading. MOF/KAT8 (the acetyltransferase subunit) deposits H4K16ac along gene bodies of X-linked genes. H4K16ac decompacts chromatin (disrupts H4 tail-H2A acidic patch interactions between nucleosomes), increasing transcriptional elongation rate and hence mRNA output approximately 2-fold per gene. (2) Mammals \u2014 female X inactivation: Females (XX) silence one X chromosome to achieve dosage parity with males (XY). Xist RNA coats the future inactive X (Xi), recruiting PRC2, SPEN/SHARP-HDAC3, and eventually DNA methyltransferases. The Xi becomes the condensed Barr body with H3K27me3, H2AK119ub, macroH2A, and CpG island methylation. (3) C. elegans \u2014 hermaphrodite partial repression: In C. elegans hermaphrodites (XX), both X chromosomes are DOWNREGULATED approximately 2-fold (rather than one being silenced). The DCC (Dosage Compensation Complex), which resembles the condensin complex, binds both X chromosomes and partially represses transcription. Males (XO) have a single X at normal expression.

      "explanation": "Testing functional requirement for pluripotency requires loss-of-function approaches: (1) Loss-of-function strategies: CRISPRi (dCas9-KRAB): Targets the lncRNA-X promoter to silence transcription. This tests the requirement for both the lncRNA molecule AND the act of transcription at that locus. Advantages: specific, titratable, reversible. ASOs (Antisense Oligonucleotides)/LNA gapmers: Target the mature lncRNA transcript for RNase H-mediated degradation in the nucleus (for nuclear lncRNAs) or RISC-mediated cleavage in the cytoplasm (for cytoplasmic lncRNAs). This specifically tests whether the RNA molecule itself is required, separating its function from the act of transcription. siRNA/shRNA: Targets the mature cytoplasmic lncRNA but is less effective for nuclear lncRNAs. CRISPR knockout: Deleting the gene, but must be careful not to disrupt nearby regulatory elements. (2) Pluripotency readouts: Molecular markers: OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, REX1 expression by RT-qPCR/immunofluorescence. Functional assays: alkaline phosphatase activity (positive in undifferentiated ESCs), colony morphology (compact, refractile borders = undifferentiated; flat, spread = differentiating). Differentiation markers: Upregulation of lineage markers (Brachyury/T for mesoderm, SOX1/PAX6 for ectoderm, GATA4/SOX17 for endoderm) would indicate loss of pluripotency. Genome-wide analysis: RNA-seq to identify all affected genes and pathways (does loss of lncRNA-X cause specific lineage commitment or general differentiation?). (3) Rescue experiment: Re-expressing lncRNA-X from a heterologous promoter (not targeting by the CRISPRi) should restore pluripotency markers if the phenotype is specific to lncRNA-X loss. This controls for off-target effects. If the lncRNA functions in cis (regulating nearby genes), ectopic expression may not rescue, pointing to a cis-regulatory mechanism.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4) mRNA exemplifies delayed reinitiation as a translational regulatory mechanism: (1) ATF4 mRNA structure: The 5' UTR of ATF4 mRNA contains two uORFs upstream of the main ATF4 coding sequence. uORF1 is a short, positive-acting element (3 codons in mouse), and uORF2 is a longer inhibitory element that overlaps with the ATF4 AUG in a different reading frame. (2) Normal conditions (abundant ternary complex): The 43S pre-initiation complex (40S + eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi + other factors) scans from the 5' cap and initiates at uORF1. After translating the short uORF1, the ribosome terminates and the 40S subunit remains on the mRNA (due to reinitiation-promoting features of uORF1). The 40S rapidly reacquires a new eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC) because TC levels are high. The competent 40S-TC complex reaches uORF2 and initiates translation. After translating uORF2, the ribosome dissociates (uORF2 lacks reinitiation signals and overlaps ATF4 AUG). ATF4 is NOT translated. (3) Stress conditions (reduced ternary complex): Various stress kinases phosphorylate eIF2alpha at Ser51: GCN2 (amino acid deprivation, senses uncharged tRNA), PERK (ER stress, unfolded protein response), HRI (heme deprivation, iron deficiency), PKR (viral dsRNA, innate immune response). Phosphorylated eIF2alpha inhibits the GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) eIF2B, reducing recycling of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP. TC levels drop. After uORF1 translation, the scanning 40S takes longer to reacquire a TC. The 40S scans past uORF2 before becoming competent. The 40S reacquires TC after uORF2 and initiates at the ATF4 AUG. ATF4 IS translated. (4) ATF4 function: ATF4 activates genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and autophagy as part of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR).

      "explanation": "Transcription factories represent a spatial organization model of nuclear transcription: (1) Discovery: Using immunofluorescence with anti-Pol II antibodies, Peter Cook and colleagues (1993) observed that RNA Pol II is not uniformly distributed but concentrated in ~2,000-8,000 discrete nuclear foci in mammalian cells. These foci persist even after extraction of soluble nuclear proteins, suggesting stable structural organization. (2) Composition: Each factory contains approximately 8-30 active RNA Pol II molecules, along with concentrated transcription factors, Mediator, splicing factors (SC35 domains/nuclear speckles nearby), and nascent RNA. (3) Gene colocalization: Using DNA-FISH and RNA-FISH, multiple studies show that actively transcribed genes from different chromosomal locations (even different chromosomes) can colocalize at the same nuclear focus. For example, in erythroid cells, the alpha- and beta-globin genes (on chromosomes 16 and 11, respectively) frequently colocalize at shared transcription factories when both are active. (4) Regulatory implications: The factory model proposes that genes are regulated in part by their ability to access transcription factories: Active genes migrate to factories (via chromatin dynamics, actin-myosin motor activity). Colocalization may enable coordinate regulation of functionally related genes (transcription factor sharing, local high concentration of specific regulators). The spatial segregation of transcription (factories) from RNA processing (nuclear speckles) from gene silencing (Polycomb bodies, nuclear lamina) creates functional nuclear compartments. (5) Super-resolution and live-cell imaging: Recent single-molecule tracking of Pol II shows dynamic clustering behavior consistent with transient condensate formation (related to phase separation models), lasting seconds to minutes rather than being permanent structures.

(2) Core complex: NCoR/SMRT serve as scaffold proteins that assemble a deacetylase complex containing HDAC3 (the catalytic deacetylase), TBL1 and TBLR1 (WD40 repeat proteins with F-box-like domains), and GPS2 (G protein pathway suppressor 2). (3) HDAC3 activation: Critically, HDAC3 is enzymatically inactive in isolation. It requires physical interaction with the DAD (Deacetylase Activating Domain) of NCoR/SMRT for activation. The DAD binds HDAC3 and induces a conformational change in its catalytic site. Inositol tetraphosphate (IP4) is an essential structural cofactor buried at the NCoR-HDAC3 interface.

      "explanation": "The KRAB-ZFP system represents a rapidly evolving host defense mechanism against transposable elements: (1) KRAB-ZFP family: With approximately 350 members in humans, KRAB-ZFPs are the largest transcription factor family in mammals. Each member has a variable number of C2H2 zinc finger domains (typically 4-30) at the C-terminus that provide DNA sequence specificity, and a highly conserved KRAB (Kruppel-Associated Box) domain at the N-terminus that mediates transcriptional repression. (2) Co-evolution: KRAB-ZFPs have co-evolved with TEs in an evolutionary arms race. Each time a new TE family invades the genome, the host evolves a KRAB-ZFP that specifically recognizes that TE's sequence. This explains why the KRAB-ZFP family has expanded dramatically in mammals (parallel to TE expansion). Older TEs are targeted by conserved KRAB-ZFPs, while species-specific KRAB-ZFPs target lineage-specific TEs. (3) Silencing mechanism: KRAB domain recruits KAP1/TRIM28/TIF1beta (a universal KRAB corepressor). KAP1 is a scaffold that recruits: SETDB1 (ESET): an H3K9 trimethyltransferase that deposits H3K9me3 at the TE locus. NuRD complex: containing HDAC1/2 for histone deacetylation and CHD3/4 for nucleosome remodeling. HP1 (alpha/beta/gamma): reads H3K9me3 and promotes heterochromatin spreading. DNMT3A/3B: recruited by HP1 or directly by KAP1 for DNA methylation. (4) Spreading: Initial KRAB-ZFP-KAP1-SETDB1 binding at a TE nucleation site spreads H3K9me3 into flanking host genomic DNA (sometimes silencing nearby genes \u2014 a potential source of gene regulatory evolution). (5) Early embryo requirement: KAP1 knockout is embryonic lethal. During the period of global DNA demethylation in the early embryo (when DNA methylation-based TE silencing is lost), the KRAB-ZFP/KAP1/SETDB1 system provides an essential alternative silencing mechanism to prevent TE reactivation. (6) Regulatory co-option: Over evolutionary time, silenced TEs with their associated KRAB-ZFP binding sites and H3K9me3 domains can be co-opted as novel regulatory elements (enhancers, insulators, promoters) for nearby host genes.",

      "question": "Researchers use nascent RNA-seq (GRO-seq) to compare transcription rates with steady-state mRNA levels (RNA-seq) across the genome. They find that while transcription rates for most genes correlate well with mRNA levels, a subset of ~500 genes shows high transcription rates but low mRNA levels, and another subset of ~200 genes shows low transcription rates but high mRNA levels. What processes explain these discrepancies?",
      "options": [
        "All genes have identical mRNA decay rates so transcription rate always equals mRNA level",
        "The high-transcription/low-mRNA genes are all pseudogenes that produce non-functional transcripts",

        "Genes with high transcription but low mRNA have rapid mRNA degradation (short half-lives, possibly through ARE-mediated decay, NMD, or miRNA targeting); genes with low transcription but high mRNA levels have exceptionally stable transcripts (long half-lives, possibly due to stabilizing 3' UTR elements or protective RNA-binding proteins) \u2014 demonstrating that steady-state mRNA levels are determined by both transcription AND decay rates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This experiment elegantly demonstrates the dual determinants of mRNA abundance: (1) Fundamental principle: Steady-state mRNA level = Transcription rate / Decay rate (at equilibrium, synthesis = degradation). Therefore, mRNA abundance reflects both synthesis and turnover, and comparing nascent transcription rates with steady-state levels reveals post-transcriptional regulation. (2) High transcription / low mRNA (rapid decay): These genes are actively transcribed at high rates but their mRNAs are rapidly degraded. Typical mechanisms include: AU-rich elements (AREs) in 3' UTRs recruiting TTP/tristetraprolin and CCR4-NOT deadenylase (cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6, and proto-oncogenes like c-Fos, c-Myc have half-lives of 15-30 minutes). miRNA-mediated repression (abundant miRNAs targeting the 3' UTR accelerate deadenylation and degradation). Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targeting mRNAs with upstream ORFs or extended 3' UTRs. Regulation by m6A modification (YTHDF2-mediated decay). (3) Low transcription / high mRNA (high stability): These genes are transcribed at modest rates but their mRNAs persist: Housekeeping genes often have long-lived mRNAs (half-lives of 10-20+ hours) due to absence of destabilizing elements. Beta-globin mRNA has a half-life of >24 hours in erythroid cells, stabilized by the alpha-complex binding the 3' UTR. Histone mRNAs (replication-dependent) are extremely stable during S phase (stabilized by stem-loop binding protein SLBP) but rapidly degraded after S phase. Collagen mRNAs have long half-lives stabilized by LARP6 binding the 5' UTR stem-loop. (4) Quantification: mRNA half-lives in mammalian cells range from ~15 minutes (c-Fos, Myc) to >24 hours (beta-globin, collagens). The median mRNA half-life is approximately 7-10 hours. (5) Metabolic labeling methods (4sU-seq, SLAM-seq) can directly measure both synthesis and decay rates for every mRNA, providing a complete kinetic picture of gene expression regulation.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator (hypersensitive site 4) is the best-characterized vertebrate insulator element: (1) Two distinct activities: Enhancer-blocking and barrier activity are genetically separable \u2014 they can be disrupted independently by different mutations, showing they are mediated by different mechanisms. (2) Enhancer-blocking activity: The core enhancer-blocking element is a 250 bp region containing a CTCF binding site. CTCF (11-zinc-finger protein) binds this site and prevents enhancers located on one side of the insulator from activating promoters on the other side. Mechanism: CTCF organizes chromatin into loops (via cohesin recruitment) that physically separate enhancer and promoter into different topological domains. Mutation of the CTCF binding site eliminates enhancer-blocking but not barrier activity. (3) Barrier activity: The barrier element is a broader region (~1.2 kb) that prevents the spreading of condensed heterochromatin. USF1/USF2 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors) bind to an E-box motif within HS4 and recruit: p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (deposits H3K9ac, H4ac), SET7/9 H3K4 methyltransferase (deposits H3K4me2), and possibly other chromatin-opening enzymes. These active marks create a chromatin environment incompatible with heterochromatin establishment (H3K9me3/HP1 cannot spread through H3K4me2/acetylated regions). (4) Gene therapy applications: HS4 insulators are placed flanking therapeutic transgene cassettes in gene therapy vectors (retroviral, lentiviral) to: prevent insertional activation of nearby proto-oncogenes by the vector's enhancer/promoter (enhancer-blocking), prevent silencing of the transgene by surrounding heterochromatin at the integration site (barrier activity), and improve sustained transgene expression. (5) Limitations: Full-length HS4 (1.2 kb) is often too large for viral vectors with limited cargo capacity. The core 250 bp element retains enhancer-blocking but reduced barrier activity.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 TRUE: SR proteins (SRSF1/ASF/SF2, SRSF2/SC35, SRSF3/SRp20, etc.) are essential splicing regulators with modular architecture: one or two RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) for sequence-specific RNA binding, and an RS (arginine-serine) domain for protein-protein interactions. SR proteins bind ESE sequences within exons and promote splicing by: directly recruiting U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site (RS domain of SR protein interacts with RS domain of U1-70K subunit), recruiting U2AF65/35 to the 3' splice site polypyrimidine tract, and bridging across the exon (exon definition model) to promote exon recognition. S2 TRUE: hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) proteins generally antagonize SR proteins. hnRNP A1 binds ESSs and ISSs and can: sterically block U2AF or U1 snRNP binding, oligomerize along RNA to spread repression, and promote exon skipping by looping out the repressed exon. Other repressive hnRNPs include PTB/hnRNP I (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, competes with U2AF for binding), hnRNP C, and hnRNP H/F. S3 TRUE: The relative levels of SR proteins and hnRNPs differ between tissues and cell types, creating tissue-specific splicing patterns. For example: in neurons, nPTB (neuronal PTB/PTBP2) replaces PTB, allowing neuron-specific exon inclusion. In muscle, MBNL (Muscleblind-like) proteins promote muscle-specific exon inclusion. The balance model explains how a single pre-mRNA can be spliced differently in different tissues depending on the local concentration of competing positive (SR) and negative (hnRNP) regulators. S4 FALSE: In addition to the major U2-type spliceosome (processing >99% of introns), a minor U12-type spliceosome exists. The U12 spliceosome uses U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac snRNPs (analogous to U1, U2, U4, U6) and processes a small subset (~0.4%) of introns called U12-type or AT-AC introns. These introns have distinct, highly conserved splice site consensus sequences. Despite being rare, U12-type introns are found in critical genes (voltage-gated ion channels, DNA replication factors) and their mis-splicing causes developmental disorders.",

      "options": [
        "Nuclear lamina positioning has no relationship to gene expression or chromatin state",
        "LADs are generally gene-poor, transcriptionally inactive regions enriched in H3K9me2/me3 and depleted of active marks; genes relocated to the nuclear periphery are typically silenced, and genes released from LADs during differentiation can become activated \u2014 though the causal relationship between peripheral positioning and repression is complex and partially context-dependent",

        "LADs contain all housekeeping genes that require constitutive expression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "LADs represent a major chromatin organizational feature connecting nuclear architecture to gene regulation: (1) LAD characteristics: LADs occupy approximately 35-40% of the mammalian genome. They are large domains (0.1-10 Mb). They are defined by DamID (DNA adenine methyltransferase identification) \u2014 fusing Dam methyltransferase to Lamin B1 or emerin and mapping sites of adenine methylation (which marks DNA in contact with the nuclear lamina). (2) Chromatin features: LADs are enriched for: H3K9me2 (deposited by G9a/GLP), H3K9me3 (at some LAD regions), low gene density, late replication timing, LINE/L1 transposable elements, and B compartment identity (in Hi-C maps). LADs are depleted of: H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3 (active marks), gene-dense regions, and SINE/Alu elements. (3) Gene silencing: Most genes within LADs (>90%) are transcriptionally silent or expressed at very low levels. Artificial tethering experiments (fusing a gene locus to a transmembrane protein that anchors it to the nuclear envelope) show that forced peripheral repositioning can silence some genes \u2014 but not all, suggesting the lamina provides a repressive environment but is not universally dominant over other regulatory inputs. (4) Developmental dynamics: During differentiation, approximately 10-20% of LADs change. Genes that must be activated in a specific lineage are released from LADs and relocate to the nuclear interior (e.g., Myogenic genes leave the lamina during muscle differentiation). Conversely, genes that must be permanently silenced in a lineage can be recruited to LADs. (5) Constitutive vs. facultative LADs: cLADs are present at the nuclear periphery in all cell types (contain gene deserts, satellite repeats). fLADs (facultative) are cell-type specific and change during differentiation \u2014 these represent dynamic gene regulation through nuclear repositioning.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In vitro nucleosome remodeling assays directly test the ability to reposition nucleosomes: (1) Substrate preparation: Reconstitute mononucleosomes by salt dialysis or using histone chaperones (NAP1, Nap1L) on a DNA fragment (typically 200-400 bp) containing a strong nucleosome positioning sequence (e.g., Widom 601 sequence, which positions nucleosomes with near-base-pair precision). The nucleosome can be positioned at one end of the DNA fragment, leaving a long free DNA overhang. (2) Remodeling reaction: Incubate reconstituted nucleosomes with purified Protein-Z in the presence of ATP (and an ATP regeneration system). Include control reactions: minus ATP (should show no remodeling, confirming ATP dependence), minus Protein-Z, and with a known remodeler (positive control, e.g., yeast RSC or ISWI). (3) Readout \u2014 Native gel electrophoresis: Nucleosomes at different positions on the DNA fragment have different electrophoretic mobilities on native polyacrylamide gels. End-positioned nucleosomes migrate faster than center-positioned nucleosomes. A shift in mobility after incubation with Protein-Z + ATP indicates nucleosome sliding. (4) Readout \u2014 Restriction enzyme accessibility (REAA): Place a unique restriction enzyme site within the nucleosome-protected region. Intact nucleosomes block restriction enzyme cutting. If Protein-Z repositions the nucleosome away from the site, the restriction enzyme can now cut. Quantify the fraction of DNA cut over time to measure remodeling kinetics.

        "Noise arises only from differences in cell size within a population",

        "Transcriptional noise is caused exclusively by errors in DNA replication"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Transcriptional bursting is a fundamental feature of gene expression observed across all kingdoms of life: (1) Discovery: Single-cell and single-molecule studies (MS2/PP7 RNA imaging, smFISH, single-cell RNA-seq) revealed that transcription is not a continuous process but occurs in discrete pulses (bursts) separated by periods of inactivity. (2) Two-state model: Genes exist in two states: OFF (promoter closed, no transcription) and ON (promoter open, active transcription). The transition rates between states \u2014 k_on (OFF\u2192ON, burst frequency) and k_off (ON\u2192OFF) \u2014 are stochastic. During each ON period, multiple mRNA molecules are produced (burst size). (3) Sources of stochasticity: Transcription factor binding: TFs bind and unbind promoters stochastically. A promoter requires multiple TFs to bind simultaneously (combinatorial control), and the probability of all factors being present at once determines k_on. Chromatin transitions: Nucleosome remodeling, histone modification, and higher-order chromatin changes are inherently stochastic. Opening a closed promoter is a rate-limiting probabilistic event. Pol II recruitment: Even at an open promoter, the assembly of the pre-initiation complex is probabilistic. (4) Noise metrics: Coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation / mean) quantifies noise. Intrinsic noise: arises from stochastic biochemistry at a single gene locus (measured by comparing two identical reporter genes in the same cell \u2014 if they differ, it is intrinsic noise). Extrinsic noise: arises from cell-to-cell variation in shared components (ribosomes, TF concentrations, cell cycle stage). (5) Functional significance: In microorganisms, noise enables bet-hedging (phenotypic diversification as a survival strategy). In development, noise combined with feedback circuits generates cell fate decisions. In the immune system, stochastic expression of olfactory receptors ensures one-receptor-per-neuron. In cancer, expression noise may contribute to drug resistance by generating rare pre-resistant cells.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR enzymes represents a post-transcriptional mechanism for expanding proteomic diversity: (1) ADAR enzymes: Mammals have three ADAR genes: ADAR1 (two isoforms, p110 and p150), ADAR2, and ADAR3 (catalytically inactive). ADARs contain double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic deaminase domain that hydrolytically deaminates the C6 amino group of adenosine to produce inosine. (2) Requirement for dsRNA: ADARs act on double-stranded RNA structures formed by intramolecular base-pairing between exonic sequences and nearby complementary intronic sequences (often inverted Alu elements in humans). (3) Inosine decoding: Inosine base-pairs with cytidine (like guanosine), so the translational machinery reads inosine as guanosine. In coding sequences, this changes the codon and can alter the encoded amino acid (recoding). (4) GluA2 Q/R site editing: The GRIA2 gene (encoding the GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit) contains a genomically encoded CAG codon (glutamine, Q) at position 607. ADAR2 edits the adenosine to inosine, changing the codon to CIG (read as CGG = arginine, R). This Q\u2192R substitution introduces a positively charged arginine into the pore-forming region of the ion channel, which: dramatically reduces Ca2+ permeability of AMPA receptors containing edited GluA2, reduces single-channel conductance, and makes the receptor impermeable to polyamines. Editing is nearly 100% efficient in the adult brain. ADAR2 knockout mice die from seizures due to excess Ca2+ influx through unedited GluA2 channels \u2014 this phenotype is fully rescued by genetically encoding arginine (R) at the Q/R site. (5) Other recoding targets: serotonin receptor 5-HT2C (multiple edited sites that modulate G-protein coupling), potassium channel Kv1.1 (I/V site), and GABRA3 (I/M site). However, the vast majority of A-to-I editing (~millions of sites) occurs in non-coding regions (Alu repeat-derived dsRNA in introns and 3' UTRs), where it modulates innate immune dsRNA sensing (preventing MDA5/MAVS activation by self dsRNA), splicing, and miRNA targeting.",

      "explanation": "The bimodal mRNA stability distribution reflects a fundamental regulatory design principle: (1) Short-lived mRNAs (regulatory genes, t1/2 = 30-60 min): These include transcription factors (c-Fos t1/2 ~15 min, c-Myc t1/2 ~25 min), cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-6), cell cycle regulators (cyclins, CDK inhibitors), growth factors, and signaling pathway components. Destabilizing elements: 3' UTR AU-rich elements (AREs: AUUUA pentamers, class I-III AREs) that recruit TTP, AUF1, and KSRP, which recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylase. Multiple miRNA binding sites (the 3' UTR of c-Myc contains binding sites for miR-34a, let-7, and others). Constitutive decay elements (CDEs) and stem-loop destabilizing elements (SLDEs). Some have coding region determinants of instability. Biological rationale: Rapid turnover enables dynamic regulation \u2014 when transcription is induced by a signal, mRNA levels rise quickly; when the signal ceases, mRNA levels fall quickly. This allows cells to respond rapidly to changing conditions. The steady-state level is determined by the balance between synthesis and decay rates. (2) Long-lived mRNAs (housekeeping genes, t1/2 = 8-12+ hours): These include beta-globin (t1/2 >24 h), ribosomal protein mRNAs, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial proteins. Stabilizing elements: lack of AREs, protective 3' UTR structures that bind stabilizing proteins (beta-globin mRNA alpha-complex), long poly(A) tails maintained by cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases, closed-loop structures (eIF4G-PABP interaction) that protect both ends. Biological rationale: Constitutive protein production with low transcriptional cost \u2014 transcribe once, translate many times before the mRNA is degraded. (3) Regulatory implications: The half-life determines how quickly a gene can be induced or repressed post-transcriptionally. Genes with short-lived mRNAs can change expression levels within minutes (e.g., immediate-early genes in response to growth factors).

H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are generally mutually exclusive on the same histone tail (except in ESC bivalent domains). H3K4me3 recruits transcription-promoting effectors (TAF3 of TFIID, CHD1, BPTF/NURF) that counteract PcG-mediated repression. (2) SWI/SNF/BAF chromatin remodelers: SWI/SNF complexes (BAF, PBAF) use ATP hydrolysis to slide or eject nucleosomes, directly opposing the chromatin compaction caused by PRC1 (which compacts chromatin through H2AK119ub and Polyhomeotic/PHC-mediated SAM domain polymerization). BRG1 (the ATPase subunit of BAF) directly opposes PRC1 at many developmental gene promoters. Loss of BAF subunits leads to inappropriate PcG-mediated silencing of target genes.

UTX is a subunit of the MLL3/4 COMPASS complex, linking H3K27me3 removal to H3K4me1 deposition at enhancers during differentiation. JMJD3 is induced by developmental signals and inflammatory stimuli. (4) Genetic antagonism: In Drosophila, mutations in TrxG genes enhance PcG phenotypes (gain of silencing), while PcG mutations suppress TrxG phenotypes. This genetic antagonism reflects the biochemical opposition between H3K4me3 (TrxG) and H3K27me3 (PcG) and between chromatin opening (SWI/SNF) and compaction (PRC1). (5) Cancer relevance: Both TrxG and PcG components are frequently mutated in cancer. MLL translocations cause acute leukemias. SWI/SNF subunit mutations (SMARCB1, ARID1A, PBRM1) are found in ~20% of all cancers. EZH2 (PRC2) is both a tumor suppressor (loss in some cancers) and an oncogene (gain-of-function in lymphomas).",

      "question": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the most widely used technique for mapping histone modifications and transcription factor binding. What is the key limitation of ChIP-seq that newer techniques like CUT&Tag address?",
      "options": [
        "ChIP-seq cannot detect any histone modifications and is only useful for transcription factors",
        "ChIP-seq requires millions of cells, extensive crosslinking, sonication that fragments epitopes, and immunoprecipitation that generates high background from non-specific DNA; CUT&Tag uses antibody-targeted Tn5 transposase (pA-Tn5) to fragment and tag DNA only at antibody-bound sites in situ, requiring far fewer cells (even single cells) with much lower background",
        "Both techniques are identical in sensitivity, specificity, and cell number requirements",
        "CUT&Tag requires more cells than ChIP-seq and produces lower-quality data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation) represents a significant technical advance over traditional ChIP-seq: (1) ChIP-seq limitations: Requires 10^5-10^7 cells (impractical for rare cell types, clinical samples). Formaldehyde crosslinking (needed for TF ChIP) can mask epitopes and create artifacts. Sonication fragments DNA non-specifically, creating high background. Immunoprecipitation step has inherent noise (non-specific DNA binding to beads, antibody cross-reactivity). Requires 20-50 million sequencing reads for adequate genome coverage. Lengthy protocol (2-3 days). (2) CUT&Tag principle: Cells are bound to Concanavalin A magnetic beads. Primary antibody + secondary antibody bind the target in situ. Protein A-Tn5 transposase (pA-Tn5) preloaded with sequencing adapters binds the antibody. Upon activation with Mg2+, Tn5 fragments and simultaneously adaptor-tags DNA only near the antibody-bound site (tagmentation). Released fragments are collected and PCR-amplified for sequencing. (3) CUT&Tag advantages: Cell number: works with as few as 100 cells (single-cell CUT&Tag has been demonstrated). Background: dramatically lower because tagmentation only occurs at antibody-bound sites; bulk chromatin remains intact. Sequencing depth: 3-8 million reads suffice (vs. 20-50M for ChIP-seq). Speed: protocol completed in one day. No crosslinking or sonication needed for histone marks (native conditions preserve epitopes). (4) CUT&Tag limitations: Less suitable for transcription factors with transient DNA binding (may need light crosslinking). pA-Tn5 has some non-specific activity. Requires high-quality antibodies. Limited by Tn5 insertion bias at certain sequences.",

        "R-loops are found exclusively in mitochondrial DNA and have no role in nuclear gene regulation",
        "R-loops form only in bacteria during replication and do not occur in eukaryotes",
        "R-loops always cause genome instability and are never beneficial for gene regulation",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "R-loops have both pathological and physiological roles in gene regulation: (1) Formation: R-loops form co-transcriptionally when nascent RNA re-anneals to the template DNA strand, displacing the non-template strand. Favored by high GC content, negative supercoiling, and G-rich non-template sequences forming G-quadruplexes. (2) At CpG island promoters (~60% of human gene promoters): R-loops physically prevent DNMT3A/3B from accessing DNA (DNMTs need dsDNA substrate), maintaining CpG islands hypomethylated and transcriptionally permissive. Loss of R-loops at some promoters leads to aberrant methylation and gene silencing. (3) At termination regions: R-loops downstream of poly(A) signals stall Pol II and facilitate torpedo termination by XRN2/Rat1, resolved by Senataxin helicase. (4) Pathological R-loops cause genome instability (displaced ssDNA is vulnerable to damage), transcription-replication conflicts, and neurodegeneration (Senataxin mutations cause ataxia). (5) Resolution by RNase H1/H2 (degrade RNA strand), Senataxin/SETX (helicase), and topoisomerases.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "ENCODE Phase 2 (2012) generated significant scientific debate: (1) Key finding: 80.4% of the genome assigned at least one biochemical function by at least one assay (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq across 147 cell types). This included: 76% transcribed into RNA, 8.1% with chromatin marks, 8.1% TF-bound, ~3% DNase-sensitive. (2) Controversy: Evolutionary biologists argued biochemical activity does not equal biological function. Only 5-8.5% shows evolutionary conservation (purifying selection). The remaining active sequences may be: spurious transcription through accessible chromatin, non-specific low-affinity TF binding, or chromatin mark consequences of nearby gene activity. (3) Current understanding: 5-15% under detectable purifying selection, additional fraction may have lineage-specific regulatory function, and much remaining genome consists of ancient transposable elements (45%). The operational definition of function (biochemical activity vs. evolutionary conservation vs. phenotypic consequence) remains debated.",

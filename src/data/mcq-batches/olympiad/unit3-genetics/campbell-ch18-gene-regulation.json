      "question": "The lac operon in E. coli is regulated by both negative control (LacI repressor) and positive control (CAP-cAMP). When glucose is absent and lactose is present, the operon is maximally transcribed. What molecular event triggers the positive regulation by the CAP-cAMP system?",
      "options": ["When glucose is absent, adenylyl cyclase is active and produces high levels of cAMP; cAMP binds to CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein), causing a conformational change that enables CAP-cAMP to bind a specific DNA site upstream of the lac promoter, bending the DNA and recruiting RNA polymerase to increase transcription ~50-fold", "CAP directly senses lactose in the medium and activates transcription", "Glucose inhibits the lac repressor, and when glucose is removed, the repressor falls off", "CAP phosphorylates the sigma factor to increase its affinity for the lac promoter"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The CAP-cAMP positive regulatory system provides catabolite repression (also called the glucose effect), ensuring that E. coli preferentially uses glucose over secondary carbon sources like lactose. The mechanism: (1) When glucose is present: The glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) transports glucose into the cell. During this process, the PTS component EIIAGlc is dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylated EIIAGlc directly inhibits adenylyl cyclase, resulting in low cAMP levels. Without cAMP, CAP cannot bind DNA, and lac operon transcription is minimal even if lactose is present (because the lac promoter is inherently weak without CAP assistance). (2) When glucose is absent: EIIAGlc accumulates in its phosphorylated form (P~EIIAGlc), which activates adenylyl cyclase. cAMP levels rise ~50-fold. (3) cAMP binding: cAMP binds to each monomer of the CAP homodimer (two cAMP molecules per CAP dimer), inducing a conformational change in the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. (4) DNA binding: Activated CAP-cAMP binds to a specific 22-bp palindromic sequence centered at position -61.5 relative to the lac transcription start site. (5) Transcription activation: CAP bends the DNA approximately 90 degrees and makes direct protein-protein contacts with the alpha-CTD (C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit) of RNA polymerase. This interaction recruits and stabilizes RNA polymerase at the weak lac promoter, increasing transcription approximately 50-fold. Full induction of the lac operon requires BOTH conditions: lactose present (repressor released) AND glucose absent (CAP-cAMP active).",

      "question": "Epigenetic modifications of chromatin regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is associated with transcriptional silencing. How does DNA methylation lead to gene repression?",
      "options": ["Methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs like MeCP2) recognize methylated CpG sites and recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and histone methyltransferases that establish repressive chromatin marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3), compacting chromatin into a transcriptionally silent state", "DNA methylation directly blocks RNA polymerase from binding DNA by steric hindrance", "Methylated DNA is rapidly degraded by cellular nucleases", "CpG methylation changes the genetic code, converting cytosine codons to thymine codons"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing operates through a multi-layered mechanism that connects DNA methylation to chromatin remodeling: (1) DNA methyltransferases: DNMT3A and DNMT3B establish new methylation patterns (de novo methylation), while DNMT1 maintains existing patterns during DNA replication by methylating hemimethylated CpG sites on the newly synthesized strand. (2) Methyl-CpG recognition: Methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins constitute a family of readers that specifically recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides. The founding member MeCP2 (Methyl-CpG binding Protein 2, mutations in which cause Rett syndrome) was the first characterized. Other family members include MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4. (3) Recruitment of corepressors: MeCP2 and MBD2 recruit the NuRD (Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase) complex, which contains: HDAC1/HDAC2 (histone deacetylases that remove activating acetyl marks from histone tails), CHD3/CHD4 (ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes), and MTA1/2 (metastasis-associated proteins). (4) Histone modification cascade: HDACs remove acetyl groups from H3K9ac and H3K27ac (activating marks). Histone methyltransferases (SUV39H1 for H3K9me3, EZH2/PRC2 for H3K27me3) then add repressive methyl marks. (5) Heterochromatin formation: H3K9me3 recruits HP1 (Heterochromatin Protein 1), which oligomerizes to compact chromatin and recruit more SUV39H1, creating a self-reinforcing silencing loop. (6) Direct blockade: In some cases, methylation of CpG sites within transcription factor binding motifs directly prevents factor binding (e.g., methylation of CTCF binding sites alters chromatin topology).",

      "question": "Histone modifications constitute a 'histone code' that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Which histone modification is most strongly associated with active gene promoters, and what is its mechanistic role?",
      "options": ["Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) marks active promoters; it is deposited by SET1/MLL methyltransferase complexes and is read by PHD finger and chromodomain-containing proteins that recruit transcriptional activators and chromatin remodeling complexes to maintain an open, transcription-permissive state", "Trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase II", "Ubiquitination of H2A (H2AK119ub) is the primary mark of active promoters", "Phosphorylation of H4S1 directly opens chromatin by neutralizing the histone charge"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "H3K4me3 is one of the most well-characterized activating histone marks and serves as a hallmark of active and poised gene promoters. Its biology involves: (1) Writers: H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by SET domain-containing methyltransferases. In humans, these include SET1A/SET1B and MLL1-4 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia), which function as part of COMPASS (Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1) complexes. The complexes also contain WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY-30. (2) Distribution: H3K4me3 is sharply enriched at active transcription start sites (within ~1 kb of the TSS) in a bimodal distribution flanking the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR). H3K4me1 marks active enhancers, while H3K4me2 is found at both promoters and enhancers. (3) Readers: H3K4me3 is recognized by several effector proteins: (a) TAF3 (a subunit of TFIID) contains a PHD finger that binds H3K4me3, helping recruit the general transcription machinery to active promoters. (b) CHD1 chromatin remodeler has a tandem chromodomain that binds H3K4me3 and repositions nucleosomes for transcription. (c) BPTF (bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor), a subunit of the NURF remodeling complex, recognizes H3K4me3. (d) ING (Inhibitor of Growth) family proteins contain PHD fingers that read H3K4me3. (4) Cross-talk: H3K4me3 is mutually exclusive with H3K9me3 (repressive mark) on the same histone tail, ensuring a binary active/silent state. Bivalent domains with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 mark poised promoters in embryonic stem cells.",

      "question": "Researchers perform ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) for H3K4me3 (active promoter mark) and H3K27me3 (repressive mark) in embryonic stem cells. They identify a subset of ~2,000 gene promoters that simultaneously carry both marks — termed 'bivalent domains.' When these ESCs differentiate into neurons, the bivalent domains resolve: neural genes lose H3K27me3 and retain H3K4me3, while non-neural developmental genes lose H3K4me3 and retain H3K27me3. What does this bivalent state represent?",
      "options": ["Bivalent domains represent a poised chromatin state at developmental gene promoters: genes are kept silent (by PRC2-mediated H3K27me3) but ready for rapid activation (maintained by H3K4me3) upon appropriate differentiation signals, allowing lineage-specific resolution into active or stably silenced states", "Bivalent domains are artifacts of the ChIP-seq technique and have no biological significance", "Both marks are deposited randomly and independently at all promoters", "Bivalent domains represent genes that are actively transcribed bidirectionally"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Bivalent chromatin domains, discovered by Bernstein et al. (2006), represent one of the most important concepts in stem cell epigenetics and developmental biology: (1) Structure: Bivalent domains consist of broad H3K27me3 domains (deposited by PRC2/EZH2) containing narrow peaks of H3K4me3 (deposited by MLL2/KMT2B) at the TSS. Single-cell and sequential ChIP experiments confirmed that both marks can co-exist on the same allele and even on the same nucleosome (H3K4me3 on one H3 tail, H3K27me3 on the other H3 tail in the same nucleosome). (2) Gene targets: Bivalent domains predominantly mark promoters of key developmental transcription factors (HOX genes, SOX genes, PAX genes, FOX genes) that are silent in ESCs but must be activated in specific lineages during differentiation. (3) Functional significance: The bivalent state creates a 'poised' gene that is transcriptionally silent but epigenetically primed for rapid activation. H3K27me3 maintains repression (preventing premature differentiation), while H3K4me3 prevents stable silencing (maintaining future activation potential). Without H3K4me3, these genes might become permanently silenced (like repetitive elements). (4) Resolution during differentiation: When differentiation signals arrive, lineage-appropriate genes: lose H3K27me3 (via UTX/KDM6A/JMJD3 demethylases recruited by lineage-specific transcription factors), retain H3K4me3, and become actively transcribed. Genes for other lineages: retain or gain H3K27me3, lose H3K4me3, and become stably silenced. (5) Disease relevance: Disruption of bivalent domain regulators (EZH2, MLL2, UTX) is common in cancer and developmental disorders.",

      "question": "X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals ensures dosage compensation by silencing one X chromosome. The non-coding RNA Xist plays a central role in this process. How does Xist initiate X-chromosome silencing?",
      "options": ["Xist RNA is transcribed from the X inactivation center (Xic) and coats the future inactive X chromosome in cis; it recruits PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) and other silencing factors through interaction with proteins like SPEN/SHARP, leading to H3K27me3 deposition, histone deacetylation, DNA methylation, and formation of the condensed Barr body", "Xist encodes a protein that directly degrades one X chromosome", "Xist base-pairs with all genes on the X chromosome, blocking their transcription by steric hindrance", "Xist recruits telomerase to shorten one X chromosome until it is too small to be transcribed"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "X-chromosome inactivation is one of the best-studied examples of epigenetic silencing and involves a complex, multi-step process orchestrated by the long non-coding RNA Xist: (1) Choice and counting: In each female cell, one X chromosome is randomly chosen for inactivation. The choice mechanism involves the antisense transcript Tsix, which represses Xist on the future active X (Xa). On the future inactive X (Xi), Tsix is downregulated, allowing Xist expression. (2) Xist coating: Xist RNA (~17 kb in mouse) is transcribed from the Xi and spreads along the chromosome in cis, coating the entire Xi. Xist spreading follows a specific pattern, first accumulating at gene-dense regions. (3) Silencing factor recruitment: Xist contains multiple functional domains (Repeats A, B, C, E, F) that recruit different silencing effectors. Repeat A recruits SPEN/SHARP, which interacts with the NCoR/SMRT-HDAC3 corepressor complex to deacetylate histones — this is the earliest and most critical silencing step. Repeat B recruits PCGF3/5 (PRC1 variant), which monoubiquitinates H2AK119. H2AK119ub recruits PRC2, which deposits H3K27me3. (4) Chromatin compaction: Progressive accumulation of repressive marks leads to loss of active marks (H3K4me3, acetylation), incorporation of histone variant macroH2A, late DNA methylation of CpG islands, and spatial reorganization into the Barr body. (5) Maintenance: Once established, XCI is stably maintained through cell divisions by DNA methylation and histone modifications, independent of continued Xist expression (though Xist continues to be expressed from Xi).",

      "question": "Evaluate the following statements about the lac operon regulation:\nS1: In the absence of both glucose and lactose, the lac operon is transcribed at a low basal level because CAP-cAMP is bound but the repressor is also bound to the operator\nS2: IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) is a gratuitous inducer that binds the lac repressor but cannot be metabolized by beta-galactosidase\nS3: The lac repressor binds as a tetramer to the primary operator (O1) and can simultaneously contact auxiliary operators (O2, O3) through DNA looping, increasing repression ~70-fold\nS4: Allolactose, not lactose itself, is the natural inducer of the lac operon; it is produced by a side reaction of beta-galactosidase",
      "options": ["S1-True, S2-True, S3-True, S4-True", "S1-False, S2-True, S3-True, S4-True", "S1-True, S2-True, S3-False, S4-True", "S1-True, S2-False, S3-True, S4-False"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "All four statements are TRUE: S1 is TRUE: When glucose is absent (high cAMP → CAP-cAMP binds upstream site) but lactose is also absent (repressor binds operator), there is a conflict between activation and repression. The repressor wins because it physically blocks RNA polymerase access to the promoter. However, because repressor binding is not 100% efficient (dynamic equilibrium), there is a very low basal transcription level (~0.1% of fully induced). This basal level is important because it produces the small amount of beta-galactosidase and permease needed to import and convert the first molecules of lactose to allolactose, allowing initial induction. S2 is TRUE: IPTG is a synthetic analog of allolactose widely used in molecular biology. It binds the lac repressor with high affinity and induces the conformational change that releases the repressor from DNA. However, IPTG lacks the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond that beta-galactosidase cleaves in lactose/allolactose, making it non-hydrolyzable. This ensures stable, sustained induction at constant concentrations — critical for controlled gene expression experiments using lac-based expression systems. S3 is TRUE: The lac repressor is a homotetramer (dimer of dimers). One dimer binds O1 (the primary operator overlapping the promoter), while the other dimer simultaneously binds O2 (+401, within lacZ) or O3 (-82, within CAP binding site) through DNA looping. This looping increases repression ~70-fold compared to O1 alone, because it stabilizes repressor-operator binding. S4 is TRUE: Allolactose (1,6-allolactose) is produced when beta-galactosidase performs an intramolecular transglycosylation on lactose, creating a 1→6 linkage instead of the normal 1→4 linkage. This creates a positive feedback circuit — enough basal beta-galactosidase converts lactose to allolactose, which induces more operon expression.",

      "question": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form two major complexes — PRC1 and PRC2 — that maintain transcriptional repression of developmental genes. What is the hierarchical relationship between PRC2 and canonical PRC1, and how do they establish stable gene silencing?",
      "options": ["PRC2 (containing EZH2 methyltransferase) first deposits H3K27me3; canonical PRC1 (containing CBX chromodomain proteins) recognizes and binds H3K27me3, then its RING1A/B E3 ligase subunit monoubiquitinates H2AK119, which compacts chromatin and blocks RNA Pol II elongation", "PRC1 acts first to ubiquitinate histones, which then recruits PRC2 for methylation", "PRC1 and PRC2 are completely independent and never interact", "PRC2 directly contacts RNA polymerase to prevent promoter binding without any histone modifications"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Polycomb repressive system represents one of the best-characterized epigenetic silencing mechanisms. The classical hierarchical model describes a sequential recruitment pathway: PRC2 complex: (1) Core subunits: EZH2 (or EZH1) is the catalytic SET-domain methyltransferase, with EED, SUZ12, and RbAp46/48 as essential accessory subunits. (2) Function: PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K27. H3K27me3 is the repressive mark. (3) PRC2 is recruited to target genes through multiple mechanisms: interaction with long non-coding RNAs (e.g., Xist, HOTAIR), recognition of unmethylated CpG islands (variant PRC2 with JARID2 and AEBP2), and propagation through recognition of existing H3K27me3 (allosteric activation of EZH2 by EED binding H3K27me3 on neighboring nucleosomes). Canonical PRC1 complex: (4) The CBX subunit (CBX2/4/6/7/8) contains a chromodomain that specifically recognizes and binds H3K27me3 deposited by PRC2. (5) Once recruited, PRC1's RING1A/RING1B E3 ubiquitin ligase (with BMI1/PCGF4) monoubiquitinates histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). (6) H2AK119ub1 compacts chromatin fibers and blocks RNA Pol II elongation by preventing the recruitment of the FACT histone chaperone. However, recent work has revised this model: variant PRC1 (containing PCGF1/3/5/6 instead of CBX) can act independently of PRC2 and actually recruits PRC2 through H2AK119ub1, creating a feed-forward loop.",

      "question": "A researcher discovers that a gene is silenced in cancer cells but active in normal cells. She hypothesizes that promoter hypermethylation causes the silencing. Which experiment would most directly test this hypothesis?",
      "options": ["Treat cancer cells with 5-azacytidine (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that causes passive demethylation during replication), then measure gene re-expression by RT-qPCR; additionally, perform bisulfite sequencing of the promoter CpG island to compare methylation patterns between normal and cancer cells", "Sequence the gene coding region to look for mutations", "Measure the gene's mRNA level by Northern blot in the cancer cells only", "Overexpress the gene from a plasmid to determine if the protein is functional"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Testing the DNA methylation hypothesis requires both functional and direct measurement approaches: (1) 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) or its deoxy derivative 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) treatment: These are nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into DNA during replication. Once incorporated, they form covalent adducts with DNMT1, trapping and inactivating the enzyme. This causes passive, replication-dependent loss of DNA methylation (because DNMT1 can no longer methylate the newly synthesized strand). If the gene is silenced by methylation, 5-azacytidine treatment should reactivate its expression, measurable by RT-qPCR. This provides functional evidence that methylation is responsible for silencing. (2) Bisulfite sequencing: Bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil (read as thymine after PCR), while methylated cytosines are protected and remain as cytosines. Sequencing the bisulfite-converted DNA reveals the methylation status of every CpG dinucleotide in the region. Comparing the promoter CpG island between normal cells (expected: unmethylated → many C→T conversions) and cancer cells (expected: methylated → cytosines preserved) provides direct molecular evidence. (3) Additional supporting experiments would include: ChIP for repressive marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) at the promoter, MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation), treatment with HDAC inhibitors (e.g., SAHA) which may synergize with 5-azacytidine, and CRISPR-based targeted demethylation using dCas9-TET1 fusion to prove causality at the specific locus.",

      "options": ["The cohesin complex (SMC1/SMC3 ring) is extruded through a loop extrusion mechanism by the motor activity of cohesin, and CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) bound to convergently oriented CTCF motifs at TAD boundaries acts as a barrier that stops cohesin extrusion, defining the limits of each TAD", "Histones spontaneously aggregate to form boundary elements without any protein factors", "RNA polymerase II pausing creates physical barriers that define TAD boundaries", "Nuclear lamins directly create chromatin loops that correspond to TADs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "TADs (Topologically Associating Domains) are fundamental units of 3D genome organization, typically 200 kb to 2 Mb in size, within which chromatin preferentially interacts. TAD boundaries are established by a loop extrusion mechanism involving cohesin and CTCF: (1) Cohesin loading: The cohesin complex (a ring-shaped structure of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21/SCC1, and SA1/SA2) is loaded onto chromatin by the NIPBL-MAU2 loader complex, typically at active promoters and enhancers. (2) Loop extrusion: Cohesin acts as a molecular motor that actively extrudes chromatin through its ring, progressively enlarging the loop. This process requires ATP and creates loops that bring distant genomic elements into proximity. (3) CTCF boundary formation: CTCF proteins bind to specific DNA motifs (consensus: CCCTC + flanking sequences). Cohesin extrusion is blocked when it encounters two CTCF proteins bound to convergently oriented motifs (facing each other on opposite strands). This creates a stable loop anchor — the TAD boundary. (4) Orientation dependence: The directionality of CTCF motifs is critical. Only convergent (inward-facing) CTCF sites form stable boundaries. Tandem or divergent orientations allow cohesin to pass through. Inverting a CTCF site by CRISPR can redirect loop formation and alter gene expression. (5) Functional significance: TAD boundaries insulate enhancers and promoters in different TADs, preventing inappropriate gene activation. TAD disruption (by deletion or inversion of CTCF sites) can cause developmental disorders and cancer through enhancer hijacking — where an enhancer inappropriately activates a gene in an adjacent TAD.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "miRNA biogenesis is a well-defined, multi-step pathway: (1) Transcription: Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be several kilobases. Pri-miRNAs have a 5' cap and poly-A tail. Many miRNAs reside in introns of protein-coding genes (mirtrons) or are transcribed from independent transcription units. (2) Nuclear processing (Microprocessor): The RNase III enzyme Drosha, complexed with the dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge Critical Region 8, also called Pasha), recognizes the pri-miRNA stem-loop structure. Drosha cleaves both strands of the stem approximately 11 bp from the base of the stem and ~22 bp from the loop, releasing a ~65-70 nt hairpin precursor (pre-miRNA) with a 2-nt 3' overhang (characteristic of RNase III cleavage). (3) Nuclear export: The pre-miRNA is recognized and exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 (XPO5) in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner. Exportin-5 recognizes the 2-nt 3' overhang and the double-stranded stem structure. (4) Cytoplasmic processing: Dicer (another RNase III enzyme, complexed with TRBP) recognizes the pre-miRNA, measuring from the 3' overhang, and cleaves the loop region to produce a ~22 bp miRNA duplex with 2-nt 3' overhangs on both ends. (5) RISC loading: The miRNA duplex is loaded into an Argonaute protein (AGO1-4 in humans). The strand with the less thermodynamically stable 5' end is retained as the guide strand (mature miRNA), while the other strand (passenger/miRNA*) is discarded.

      "options": ["Attenuation relies on coupling of transcription and translation in prokaryotes: when tryptophan is abundant, ribosomes rapidly translate a leader peptide containing two consecutive Trp codons, allowing a downstream terminator hairpin (3:4 structure) to form in the mRNA, causing RNA polymerase to dissociate before transcribing the structural genes", "Attenuation involves the binding of tryptophan directly to the mRNA, which causes its degradation", "Attenuation occurs when excess tryptophan molecules physically block RNA polymerase movement", "Attenuation involves a ribozyme in the trp leader that self-cleaves when tryptophan is present"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Attenuation of the trp operon is an elegant regulatory mechanism discovered by Charles Yanofsky that exploits the coupling of transcription and translation unique to prokaryotes. The trp leader sequence (trpL) encodes a 14-amino-acid leader peptide containing two tandem tryptophan codons (Trp-Trp at positions 10-11). The leader mRNA contains four regions (1-4) that can form alternative secondary structures: regions 1:2 form an anti-terminator, regions 2:3 form a pause site that stalls RNA polymerase to allow ribosome loading, and regions 3:4 form a rho-independent transcription terminator. When tryptophan is ABUNDANT: charged tRNATrp is plentiful, so the ribosome rapidly translates through the Trp codons in region 1, reaches region 2, and prevents 2:3 pairing. This allows the 3:4 terminator hairpin to form, causing RNA polymerase to terminate transcription before reaching the structural genes (trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, trpA). Only the short leader transcript is produced. When tryptophan is SCARCE: uncharged tRNATrp accumulates, and the ribosome stalls at the tandem Trp codons in region 1. This leaves region 2 free to pair with region 3 (anti-terminator), preventing the 3:4 terminator from forming. RNA polymerase reads through and transcribes the structural genes. Attenuation fine-tunes expression ~8-fold, while repression provides ~70-fold regulation, giving ~600-fold combined regulation.",

      "options": ["Dscam can generate 38,016 mRNA isoforms through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of four clusters of exons (12 × 48 × 33 × 2 variants); each neuron expresses a unique combination, enabling self-avoidance during axon guidance where neurites from the same cell repel each other but neurites from different cells can interact", "Dscam generates only 2 isoforms that differ in the transmembrane domain", "Dscam produces about 100 isoforms used exclusively in immune defense", "Dscam alternative splicing generates 5 isoforms each expressed in a different tissue type"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Drosophila Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) represents the most extreme example of regulated alternative splicing known: (1) Gene structure: The Dscam gene contains 115 exons, of which 95 are alternatively spliced in four clusters of mutually exclusive exons: exon 4 cluster (12 variants), exon 6 cluster (48 variants), exon 9 cluster (33 variants), and exon 17 cluster (2 variants). (2) Combinatorial diversity: 12 × 48 × 33 × 2 = 38,016 possible extracellular domain isoforms. This exceeds the total number of genes in the Drosophila genome (~14,000). Each isoform has a unique combination of immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that determine homophilic binding specificity. (3) Mutual exclusivity mechanism: Within each cluster, only one exon is selected. This is achieved through competing RNA secondary structures: a docking site in the constitutive exon upstream of each cluster base-pairs with a selector sequence unique to each alternative exon. The RNA structure formed first is selected, and the remaining alternative exons in that cluster are skipped. (4) Self-avoidance function: Each neuron stochastically expresses a subset of ~10-50 Dscam isoforms on its surface. When two neurites from the SAME neuron contact each other, their matching Dscam isoforms engage in homophilic binding, triggering mutual repulsion — this prevents neurites from fasciculating with themselves. Neurites from DIFFERENT neurons express different Dscam combinations, so they do not repel. (5) This self-avoidance mechanism is essential for proper dendritic arborization and axon branching patterns in the nervous system.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The classical C2H2 zinc finger is one of the most common DNA-binding domains in eukaryotic transcription factors (e.g., TFIIIA, Sp1, Kruppel). Each finger consists of ~30 amino acids forming a compact ββα structure stabilized by coordination of a Zn2+ ion between two cysteine residues in the β-sheet and two histidine residues in the α-helix. The α-helix inserts into the major groove and makes sequence-specific contacts with 3-4 base pairs. Proteins typically contain multiple tandem zinc fingers (Sp1 has 3, TFIIIA has 9), each contacting adjacent DNA subsites. S2 is TRUE: The leucine zipper (discovered by Steven McKnight, 1988) is a coiled-coil dimerization motif found in bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors like C/EBP, Jun, Fos, and CREB. Leucine residues occur at every seventh position (heptad repeat position 'd') in a ~30-residue α-helix. The hydrophobic leucines from two helices interdigitate like a zipper to mediate parallel coiled-coil dimerization. The basic region (immediately N-terminal to the zipper) contacts DNA in the major groove. Heterodimerization expands combinatorial diversity (e.g., Jun-Fos heterodimer = AP-1). S3 is FALSE: While HTH motifs were first characterized in prokaryotic regulators (lambda repressor, Cro, CAP), they are widely present in eukaryotes. The homeodomain is a 60-amino-acid HTH variant found in Hox genes and many developmental transcription factors. Winged-helix and forkhead (FOX) domains are also HTH-related motifs abundant in eukaryotes. S4 is TRUE: The homeodomain was discovered in Drosophila homeotic genes (Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax) and is remarkably conserved across all animal phyla. It consists of three α-helices; helix 3 (recognition helix) contacts the major groove, while the N-terminal arm contacts the minor groove.",

      "options": ["Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was orders of magnitude more effective at silencing than either sense or antisense single-stranded RNA alone, and the silencing was catalytic — substoichiometric amounts of dsRNA could silence much larger quantities of target mRNA, suggesting an amplified enzymatic mechanism", "Single-stranded antisense RNA was more effective than dsRNA", "RNAi only worked in plants and could not be replicated in animals", "RNAi required direct injection of protein into cells rather than nucleic acid"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 1998 Nature paper by Fire and Mello that discovered RNAi (Nobel Prize 2006) made several groundbreaking observations in C. elegans: (1) dsRNA potency: When they injected dsRNA corresponding to the unc-22 gene (which encodes a muscle protein), they observed a dramatic twitching phenotype indicating unc-22 silencing. The same amount of sense or antisense single-stranded RNA alone produced little or no silencing. dsRNA was at least 10-100 times more potent than antisense RNA. (2) Catalytic nature: Very small amounts of dsRNA (just a few molecules per cell) could effectively silence the target gene, meaning the dsRNA must be acting catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. This suggested an enzymatic amplification mechanism — later shown to involve RISC recycling, where the Argonaute-siRNA complex is not consumed after cleaving one target mRNA but can cleave multiple target molecules. In C. elegans, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) further amplify the signal by synthesizing secondary siRNAs. (3) Systemic spreading: Remarkably, dsRNA injected into one tissue could silence the target gene throughout the organism, indicating cell-to-cell spreading. This was later attributed to the transmembrane channel SID-1 (Systemic RNA Interference Defective-1) that imports dsRNA. (4) Specificity: The silencing was exquisitely sequence-specific — only mRNAs with complementarity to the dsRNA trigger were affected. (5) Mechanism (later elucidated): Dicer cleaves long dsRNA into 21-23 nt siRNA duplexes; one strand is loaded into AGO2-containing RISC; the guide strand directs RISC to complementary mRNA; AGO2 cleaves the target between positions 10-11 relative to the guide.",

Construct C (5 kb upstream region with a 200 bp deletion at -3.2 to -3.0 kb) drives strong GFP expression in liver, kidney, and brain. What can be concluded about the deleted 200 bp element?",
      "options": ["The deleted 200 bp element at -3.2 to -3.0 kb functions as a silencer that specifically represses gene expression in kidney and brain; removing it de-represses expression in those tissues while the tissue-specific enhancer(s) for liver expression reside elsewhere in the 5 kb region", "The deleted element is a liver-specific enhancer", "The deleted region is an origin of replication required for reporter maintenance", "The deletion has no effect and the differences are due to experimental variation"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This reporter analysis reveals the presence of a tissue-specific silencer element: (1) Construct A (full regulatory region → liver only, strong): The complete regulatory region contains all elements needed for proper tissue-specific expression. Strong expression in liver indicates the presence of a liver-specific enhancer somewhere in the 5 kb region. Absence of expression in kidney/brain indicates active repression in those tissues. (2) Construct B (proximal promoter only → weak ubiquitous): The core/proximal promoter (TATA box, initiator, CpG island) can recruit the basal transcription machinery in any cell type, resulting in low-level constitutive transcription. The absence of enhancers explains why expression is weak. The ubiquitous expression shows the promoter itself has no tissue specificity. (3) Construct C (full region minus 200 bp → liver + kidney + brain, strong): Removing the 200 bp element at -3.2 kb de-represses expression in kidney and brain while maintaining strong liver expression. This means: (a) The deleted element is NOT a liver enhancer (liver expression is maintained). (b) The deleted element is a silencer that actively represses transcription in non-liver tissues. (c) There must be separate enhancers that can drive expression in kidney and brain, but their activity is normally overridden by the silencer. (4) Silencer mechanism: Silencers bind transcriptional repressors (e.g., REST/NRSF for neuronal genes, or tissue-specific repressors) that recruit co-repressor complexes (NCoR, SMRT, HDACs) to establish repressive chromatin. Unlike insulators (which block enhancer-promoter communication), silencers directly repress transcription at target promoters.

      "options": ["In the early embryo, parental methylation patterns must be erased to restore totipotency and allow activation of the embryonic genome; in primordial germ cells, erasure of parental imprints and transposon silencing marks is needed to establish sex-specific imprints appropriate for the next generation", "Demethylation occurs only to remove damaged bases from the DNA sequence", "Genome-wide demethylation is a random process that has no developmental significance", "Demethylation happens only in cancer cells and is not part of normal development"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Epigenetic reprogramming through genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs at two distinct developmental windows, each serving a unique biological purpose: (1) Post-fertilization reprogramming (zygote to blastocyst, E0.5-E3.5 in mouse): After fertilization, the paternal genome undergoes rapid ACTIVE demethylation mediated by TET3 (Ten-Eleven Translocation 3), which oxidizes 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), then to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) excises 5fC/5caC via base excision repair (BER). The maternal genome is demethylated more slowly through PASSIVE dilution — DNMT1 is excluded from the nucleus during early cleavage divisions, so methylation patterns are not maintained. Purpose: (a) Erase somatic epigenetic marks from gametes to restore totipotency. (b) Activate the embryonic genome (zygotic genome activation, ZGA) at the 2-cell stage (mouse) or 4-8 cell stage (human). (c) Allow establishment of the first cell fate decision (inner cell mass vs. trophectoderm). Important exceptions: Imprinted genes and certain retrotransposons escape this wave of demethylation, maintained by DNMT1 with the help of STELLA/PGC7 and ZFP57/KAP1 (TRIM28). (2) Primordial germ cell (PGC) reprogramming (E8.5-E13.5 in mouse): PGCs undergo the most comprehensive demethylation event in the mammalian life cycle, reducing global methylation from ~70% to ~7%. Both active (TET1/TET2) and passive mechanisms contribute. This erases: (a) Parental imprints — allowing new sex-appropriate imprints to be established (paternal imprints in spermatogenesis, maternal imprints in oogenesis). (b) Stable epigenetic marks that would otherwise transmit epigenetic information transgenerationally. Transposons are transiently de-repressed during PGC reprogramming but are re-silenced by piRNA-guided de novo methylation.",

      "options": ["On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR binds CTCF insulator protein, which blocks the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter; on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF binding, so enhancers can activate Igf2 while the methylated H19 promoter is silenced", "Both alleles express Igf2 and H19 equally in all tissues", "The paternal allele is completely deleted during spermatogenesis", "Imprinting at this locus is determined by the DNA sequence rather than epigenetic modifications"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Igf2/H19 imprinted locus on mouse chromosome 7 (human chromosome 11p15.5) is the paradigm for understanding imprint-dependent insulator-mediated gene regulation: (1) Locus organization (5' to 3'): Igf2 gene → ICR (Imprinting Control Region, also called DMR/H19-ICR) → H19 gene → shared enhancers (endodermal and mesodermal). (2) Maternal allele: The ICR is unmethylated. The zinc-finger protein CTCF (11-zinc-finger protein) binds to four CTCF binding sites within the unmethylated ICR. CTCF binding creates an insulator/boundary element that physically blocks the downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter. Instead, the enhancers activate H19 (the closest accessible gene). Result: H19 is expressed, Igf2 is silent. The insulator model was confirmed by deletion of CTCF binding sites (causing biallelic Igf2 expression) and by chromatin conformation capture (3C) showing distinct chromatin loop structures on each allele. (3) Paternal allele: The ICR is methylated (de novo methylation established during spermatogenesis by DNMT3A with cofactor DNMT3L). DNA methylation spreads from the ICR into the H19 promoter. Methylation has two effects: (a) CTCF cannot bind methylated DNA, so the insulator is inactive. (b) H19 promoter methylation silences H19. Without the insulator, the downstream enhancers can loop to and activate the Igf2 promoter. Result: Igf2 is expressed, H19 is silent. (4) Disease relevance: Loss of imprinting (LOI) at this locus causes Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (biallelic Igf2 → overgrowth, organomegaly, increased cancer risk) or Silver-Russell syndrome (biallelic H19/reduced Igf2 → growth restriction).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Establishing causality between a specific histone modification at a specific locus and gene expression requires locus-specific manipulation, which is best achieved using epigenome editing tools: (1) dCas9-UTX approach: Catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9, with D10A and H840A mutations that eliminate nuclease activity but retain DNA binding) is fused to the catalytic domain of UTX (also known as KDM6A), a Jumonji-domain demethylase that specifically removes H3K27me2/me3 marks (converting them to H3K27me1/me0). The fusion protein is guided to the target promoter by a complementary single-guide RNA (sgRNA). (2) Why this establishes causality: (a) Locus specificity: Only the targeted promoter is affected — other H3K27me3-marked genes throughout the genome remain silenced. This eliminates confounding effects from global demethylation. (b) Modification specificity: UTX specifically removes H3K27me3 without altering other histone modifications (H3K9me3, DNA methylation). (c) No DNA sequence change: Unlike gene knockouts or mutations, dCas9-UTX does not alter the DNA sequence, isolating the effect of the epigenetic mark. (3) Why alternatives are insufficient: (a) Global EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126, EPZ-6438) affect H3K27me3 at thousands of genomic loci, making it impossible to attribute gene reactivation to loss of H3K27me3 at the specific promoter. (b) Correlative approaches (ChIP-seq) only show association, not causation. A gene could be marked with H3K27me3 but silenced by an independent mechanism (e.g., DNA methylation). (c) Gene knockout is irrelevant — it tests gene function, not epigenetic regulation. (4) Controls needed: catalytically dead UTX fusion (dCas9-UTX_mut) to control for dCas9 binding effects, non-targeting sgRNA control, and ChIP-qPCR confirmation of H3K27me3 removal specifically at the target.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Mediator complex is a cornerstone of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, serving as the central integrator of regulatory signals: (1) Structure: Mammalian Mediator is a ~1.4 MDa complex consisting of 26-30 subunits organized into four modules: Head module (MED6, MED8, MED11, MED17, MED18, MED20, MED22) — directly contacts RNA Pol II CTD and TFIIH.

CDK module (MED12, MED13, CDK8, CycC) — reversibly associates and can be activating or repressive. (2) Enhancer-promoter communication: Gene-specific transcription factors (e.g., p53, nuclear receptors, NF-κB) bind to enhancer DNA and recruit Mediator through direct protein-protein interactions with tail subunits (e.g., nuclear receptors bind MED1/TRAP220 through LXXLL motifs). Mediator then bridges to the PIC at the promoter, stabilizing the TFIID-TFIIA-TFIIB-Pol II assembly. (3) Signal integration: Different activators contact different Mediator subunits, and the conformational flexibility of Mediator allows it to integrate these inputs. The CDK8 kinase module can phosphorylate activators, TFIIH, and histone H3, providing additional regulatory control.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The IRP-IRE system is a classic example of coordinate post-transcriptional regulation. IRPs are cytoplasmic proteins that bind IRE stem-loop structures (~30 nt) in mRNA UTRs when intracellular iron is LOW. For ferritin mRNA: The single IRE in the 5' UTR is positioned near the cap. IRP binding sterically blocks the 43S ribosomal subunit from scanning, inhibiting translation. When iron is high, IRP1 acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster and becomes cytoplasmic aconitase (losing RNA-binding ability), while IRP2 is ubiquitinated by FBXL5 E3 ligase and degraded. Released ferritin mRNA is translated. For TfR mRNA: Five IREs in the 3' UTR are adjacent to an endonuclease cleavage site. IRP binding protects the mRNA from cleavage by the endonuclease. When iron is high and IRPs dissociate, the mRNA is cleaved and rapidly degraded. S2 is TRUE: NMD is a quality control surveillance pathway. During the pioneer round of translation, the ribosome displaces EJCs deposited 20-24 nt upstream of exon-exon junctions during splicing. If translation terminates at a PTC located >50-55 nt upstream of an EJC, the downstream EJC remains and recruits UPF1 (already present at the terminating ribosome via interaction with eRF1/eRF3). UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1, recruits SMG5/6/7, and triggers mRNA degradation through endonucleolytic cleavage (SMG6) and deadenylation-decapping. S3 is TRUE: The deadenylation-dependent decay pathway is the major mRNA degradation route in eukaryotes. The CCR4-NOT complex (containing the deadenylases CCR4/CNOT6 and CAF1/CNOT7) and the PAN2-PAN3 complex progressively shorten the poly(A) tail. S4 is FALSE: AREs (AUUUA pentamers and U-rich sequences) typically recruit DESTABILIZING proteins like tristetraprolin (TTP/ZFP36), which recruits CCR4-NOT deadenylase, and AUF1, which promotes decay.

      "question": "The SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex uses ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome positioning. How does SWI/SNF remodeling differ mechanistically from histone modification enzymes like HATs and HDACs?",
      "options": ["SWI/SNF uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to physically slide, eject, or restructure nucleosomes along DNA, directly changing the accessibility of regulatory sequences, whereas HATs and HDACs covalently modify histone tail residues to alter the chemical properties of chromatin and create binding sites for effector proteins", "SWI/SNF modifies histone tails while HATs move nucleosomes", "Both SWI/SNF and HATs use ATP to add acetyl groups to histones", "SWI/SNF degrades nucleosomes while HATs synthesize new ones"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Chromatin remodeling and histone modification represent two fundamentally different mechanisms of regulating chromatin structure: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (SWI/SNF/BAF): (1) Mechanism: The catalytic ATPase subunit (BRG1/SMARCA4 or BRM/SMARCA2 in mammalian BAF complexes) contains a split ATPase domain (DExx and HELICc lobes) that translocates along DNA within the nucleosome. This translocation creates torsional strain that propagates around the histone octamer, resulting in: nucleosome sliding (repositioning along DNA), nucleosome ejection (complete removal, creating nucleosome-free regions), and histone dimer exchange (replacing canonical H2A-H2B with variants like H2A.Z). (2) Four families of ATP-dependent remodelers exist: SWI/SNF (BAF/PBAF) — uses bromodomains to target acetylated chromatin; often opens chromatin at enhancers and promoters. ISWI (ACF, CHRAC, NURF) — uses HAND-SANT-SLIDE domains; often establishes regular nucleosome spacing. CHD (Mi-2/NuRD) — uses chromodomains to target methylated chromatin; can activate or repress. INO80/SWR1 — specialized in H2A.Z incorporation (SWR1) or removal (INO80). Histone modification (HATs/HDACs): HATs (e.g., p300/CBP, GCN5, Tip60) transfer acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to lysine ε-amino groups on histone tails. This neutralizes the positive charge of lysine, weakening histone-DNA electrostatic interactions, and creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing proteins. HDACs (Class I: HDAC1-3,8; Class II: HDAC4-7,9,10; Class III: sirtuins; Class IV: HDAC11) remove acetyl groups, restoring positive charge and creating a more compact chromatin state. HDACs do not use ATP — they use zinc-dependent (Class I, II, IV) or NAD+-dependent (Class III/sirtuins) catalytic mechanisms.",

They find that ~30% of accessible chromatin regions are shared between both cell types, while ~35% are liver-specific and ~35% are brain-specific. Most cell-type-specific accessible regions are located far from transcription start sites (>5 kb away). What do these cell-type-specific distal accessible regions most likely represent?",
      "options": ["Cell-type-specific active enhancers, where tissue-specific transcription factors have opened chromatin by recruiting chromatin remodelers, enabling these distal regulatory elements to drive tissue-appropriate gene expression programs through long-range enhancer-promoter interactions", "Random DNA damage sites specific to each tissue", "Cell-type-specific origins of replication that fire only in certain tissues", "Centromeric regions that differ between cell types due to chromosome rearrangements"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "ATAC-seq reveals the landscape of open (accessible) chromatin by using the Tn5 transposase, which preferentially inserts into nucleosome-free DNA. The pattern described in this experiment reveals fundamental principles of cell-type-specific gene regulation: (1) Shared accessible regions (~30%): These correspond to: constitutive promoters of housekeeping genes (active in all cell types), insulators/CTCF boundary elements (structural), and regulatory elements for broadly expressed genes. (2) Cell-type-specific accessible regions (~70% total, split between tissues): The key observation is that these are predominantly DISTAL (>5 kb from TSSs), which is characteristic of enhancers rather than promoters. In the mammalian genome: there are ~20,000-25,000 gene promoters (mostly constitutively accessible), but ~500,000-1,000,000 potential enhancers (most are cell-type-specific). This means enhancers vastly outnumber promoters and are the primary determinants of cell identity. (3) Enhancer activation mechanism: In liver cells, liver-specific transcription factors (HNF4α, FOXA1/2, C/EBPα) bind to their cognate motifs within liver enhancers. These pioneer transcription factors (especially FOXA1/2) can bind nucleosomal DNA and recruit SWI/SNF remodelers to displace nucleosomes, creating accessible chromatin. The open enhancers then recruit p300/CBP (depositing H3K27ac), Mediator, and cohesin to form chromatin loops with target gene promoters. In brain cells, neural transcription factors (NEUROD1, BRN2, ASCL1) activate a different set of enhancers. (4) Experimental validation: Cell-type-specific ATAC-seq peaks correlate with: H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq peaks (active enhancer marks), binding sites for tissue-specific transcription factors (by motif analysis), and eQTL-associated SNPs (genetic variants affecting gene expression), confirming their regulatory function.",

      "options": ["HOTAIR serves as a molecular scaffold: its 5' domain binds PRC2 (which deposits H3K27me3) and its 3' domain binds the LSD1/CoREST/REST complex (which removes H3K4me2), targeting both repressive complexes to the HOXD locus to coordinate removal of active marks and addition of repressive marks", "HOTAIR base-pairs directly with HOXD mRNAs and triggers their degradation via RNAi", "HOTAIR encodes a small protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor at HOXD", "HOTAIR recruits DNA methyltransferases to permanently delete the HOXD genes"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HOTAIR (HOX Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA) is a 2.2 kb lncRNA that exemplifies the scaffold function of long non-coding RNAs in epigenetic regulation: (1) Genomic context: HOTAIR is transcribed from the HOXC locus (chromosome 12 in humans) in an antisense orientation relative to the HOXC genes. It was one of the first lncRNAs shown to act in trans (regulating genes on a different chromosome). (2) Dual-scaffold mechanism (Chang and Bhatt et al., 2011): The 5' domain (first 300 nt) of HOTAIR binds PRC2 (specifically the EZH2 and SUZ12 subunits), recruiting H3K27 trimethylation activity. The 3' domain (last 646 nt) binds the LSD1 (KDM1A)/CoREST/REST complex, which contains the H3K4me1/me2 demethylase LSD1. This creates a bifunctional repressive module on a single RNA molecule: one end adds repressive marks (H3K27me3) while the other removes active marks (H3K4me2). (3) Targeting to HOXD: HOTAIR is transcribed at HOXC, exported from the transcription site, and relocates to the HOXD locus on chromosome 2. The mechanism of targeting is not fully understood but may involve RNA-DNA triplex formation, interaction with DNA-binding proteins already at HOXD, or three-dimensional genome organization bringing HOXC and HOXD into proximity. (4) Functional consequence: HOTAIR-mediated recruitment of PRC2 and LSD1 to HOXD results in H3K27me3 deposition and H3K4me2 removal across a ~40 kb domain, silencing multiple HOXD genes. This is essential for proper anterior-posterior body patterning. (5) Disease: HOTAIR overexpression in breast cancer promotes metastasis by redirecting PRC2 to tumor-suppressor gene promoters, silencing them through H3K27me3.",

      "options": ["The cap is recognized by the eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) component of the eIF4F complex, which recruits the 43S pre-initiation complex to the mRNA for cap-dependent translation initiation; sequestration of eIF4E by 4E-BP proteins under nutrient-poor conditions inhibits cap-dependent translation", "The cap directly base-pairs with the 18S rRNA to position the ribosome at the start codon", "The cap serves exclusively to protect the mRNA from exonuclease degradation and has no role in translation", "The cap is removed before the mRNA reaches the ribosome and plays no role in translation initiation"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The 5' m7G cap structure is central to eukaryotic translation initiation through the cap-dependent scanning mechanism: (1) Cap recognition: eIF4E is a 25 kDa protein that specifically binds the m7G cap through stacking interactions between two tryptophan residues (W56 and W102 in mammals) and the methylated guanine ring. eIF4E is the rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, as it is present in substoichiometric amounts relative to other initiation factors. (2) eIF4F complex assembly: eIF4E, together with eIF4G (a large scaffold protein) and eIF4A (a DEAD-box RNA helicase), forms the eIF4F complex. eIF4G bridges the cap (via eIF4E) to the 43S pre-initiation complex (40S ribosomal subunit + eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5, Met-tRNAi) via its interaction with eIF3. eIF4A unwinds secondary structures in the 5' UTR to facilitate ribosome scanning. (3) Regulation by 4E-BPs: The 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, 4E-BP3) are key translational regulators. In their hypophosphorylated state (under stress, nutrient deprivation, or mTOR inhibition), 4E-BPs bind eIF4E at the same surface used by eIF4G, competitively blocking eIF4F assembly and inhibiting cap-dependent translation. When mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) is active (growth signals, nutrients), it phosphorylates 4E-BPs on multiple sites (Thr37, Thr46, Ser65, Thr70), causing their release from eIF4E. (4) Additional cap functions: nuclear export (recognized by CBC: CBP80/CBP20), splicing stimulation, polyadenylation enhancement, and protection from 5'-to-3' exonuclease XRN1 (DCP1/DCP2-mediated decapping is required before XRN1 can degrade the mRNA).",

      "options": ["The E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (HDM2 in humans) constitutively ubiquitinates p53 targeting it for proteasomal degradation; upon DNA damage, ATM/ATR kinases phosphorylate p53 (Ser15, Ser20) and MDM2 (Ser395), disrupting the p53-MDM2 interaction and stabilizing p53 to activate cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis genes", "p53 is constitutively degraded by lysosomal proteases and is stabilized by N-glycosylation upon DNA damage", "p53 levels are controlled solely by transcriptional regulation of the TP53 gene", "p53 is an unstable protein that can never accumulate in cells regardless of DNA damage"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The p53-MDM2 regulatory circuit is a critical feedback loop that controls cellular responses to genotoxic stress: (1) Normal conditions: MDM2 (Mouse Double Minute 2, also called HDM2 in humans) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a RING finger domain. MDM2 binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (residues 18-26), accomplishing three things: (a) Direct inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity by masking its transactivation domain. (b) Nuclear export of p53 via MDM2's nuclear export signal. (c) Polyubiquitination of p53 (primarily K48-linked chains on C-terminal lysines K370, K372, K373, K381, K382, K386), targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. The result: p53 half-life is approximately 20 minutes under normal conditions. (2) Negative feedback loop: MDM2 is itself a transcriptional target of p53 — creating an autoregulatory negative feedback loop that maintains low p53 levels under normal conditions and enables rapid return to baseline after stress resolution. (3) DNA damage response: When DNA damage occurs (DSBs, replication stress, UV), sensor kinases are activated: ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) responds to DSBs, while ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) responds to replication stress. These kinases phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 (ATM/ATR direct) and Ser20 (via CHK1/CHK2 intermediate kinases). MDM2 is also phosphorylated at Ser395 by ATM. These phosphorylation events disrupt the p53-MDM2 interface, preventing ubiquitination. p53 half-life increases from ~20 minutes to several hours, and nuclear p53 accumulates rapidly. (4) Additional stabilization: ARF (p14ARF in humans, p19ARF in mouse) is induced by oncogenic stress (e.g., c-Myc overexpression) and sequesters MDM2 in the nucleolus, preventing it from accessing p53. (5) p53 target genes: Stabilized p53 activates transcription of p21/CDKN1A (cell cycle arrest at G1/S), GADD45 (DNA repair), BAX, PUMA, NOXA (apoptosis), and hundreds of other genes.",

They observe that 312 mRNAs are significantly upregulated in Dicer-/- embryos compared to wild-type, while only 47 mRNAs are downregulated. What is the most likely explanation for this asymmetric gene expression change?",
      "options": ["Loss of Dicer eliminates the production of mature miRNAs and siRNAs, which primarily function to repress target mRNAs through translational inhibition and mRNA degradation; without these small RNAs, their target mRNAs are no longer repressed, leading to widespread upregulation of hundreds of targets", "The Dicer mutation increases the activity of RNA polymerase II at all promoters", "Loss of Dicer causes chromosome instability leading to gene amplification of the 312 upregulated genes", "Dicer normally degrades rRNA and its loss causes ribosome accumulation that indirectly upregulates mRNAs"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This experiment reveals the global repressive role of the Dicer-dependent small RNA pathway: (1) Dicer function: Dicer (an RNase III endoribonuclease) is the essential enzyme that processes precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into mature ~22 nt miRNA duplexes and long dsRNA into siRNAs. Without Dicer, no mature miRNAs or siRNAs are produced. (2) Why predominantly upregulation: miRNAs function primarily as post-transcriptional repressors. Each miRNA can target dozens to hundreds of mRNAs through complementary base-pairing (primarily at the seed region, positions 2-7/8 of the miRNA). The repression occurs through: (a) mRNA degradation: miRNAs recruit RISC (Argonaute + GW182/TNRC6), which recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, leading to poly(A) tail shortening and subsequent mRNA decapping and 5'-to-3' degradation by XRN1. This is the dominant mechanism in mammalian cells. (b) Translational repression: RISC can block translation initiation by interfering with eIF4F-cap interaction or by promoting ribosome drop-off. (3) Loss of Dicer removes ALL miRNAs simultaneously, de-repressing all miRNA targets — explaining the predominant upregulation (312 genes). (4) The 47 downregulated genes are likely indirect effects: some upregulated targets may be transcriptional repressors whose de-repression leads to secondary silencing of their downstream targets, or they may be stabilized by small RNA-independent mechanisms that are disrupted. (5) This experiment underscores the principle that miRNAs serve as a major layer of gene expression fine-tuning, dampening protein output to appropriate levels. Dicer knockout is embryonic lethal in mice (E7.5), demonstrating the essential nature of small RNA-mediated regulation.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a fundamental signaling cascade that controls cell fate, proliferation, and stem cell maintenance through transcriptional regulation: (1) OFF state (no Wnt): In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic beta-catenin is continuously targeted for destruction by the multiprotein destruction complex: Axin (scaffold protein), APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli tumor suppressor), GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), and CK1alpha (casein kinase 1 alpha). CK1alpha first phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser45 (priming phosphorylation). GSK3beta then sequentially phosphorylates Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized by the F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase beta-TrCP (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein), which adds K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, targeting beta-catenin for 26S proteasomal degradation. Half-life of beta-catenin: ~1 hour. (2) ON state (Wnt present): Wnt ligands bind simultaneously to the Frizzled (Fz) seven-transmembrane receptor and the LRP5/6 co-receptor. This triggers: (a) Phosphorylation of LRP5/6 intracellular PPPSPxS motifs by CK1gamma and GSK3beta. (b) Recruitment of Axin to phosphorylated LRP5/6. (c) Recruitment of Dishevelled (Dvl) to Frizzled. (d) Dvl polymerization and aggregation at the membrane. (e) Sequestration and inhibition of the destruction complex. (3) Consequence: Beta-catenin is no longer phosphorylated or degraded. It accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF transcription factors (which occupy target gene promoters in a repressive complex with Groucho in the OFF state). Beta-catenin displaces Groucho and recruits co-activators (p300/CBP, BRG1, BCL9, Pygopus) to activate target genes including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Axin2 (negative feedback), and stem cell maintenance genes.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) is the gold-standard technique for detecting protein-DNA interactions in their native chromatin context within living cells: (1) Crosslinking: Formaldehyde (typically 1% for 10 minutes) creates reversible protein-DNA and protein-protein crosslinks by forming Schiff base intermediates between primary amines (lysine side chains, N-termini) and nearby amino/imino groups. This preserves in vivo protein-DNA interactions at their actual genomic locations. (2) Chromatin fragmentation: Crosslinked chromatin is sheared by sonication (or micrococcal nuclease digestion) to 200-500 bp fragments. Fragment size is critical — too large reduces resolution, too small may disrupt interactions. (3) Immunoprecipitation: A specific antibody against TF-X is used to selectively pull down TF-X and its associated DNA fragments. The antibody is captured on Protein A/G beads. Extensive washing removes non-specific interactions. (4) Reverse crosslinking and DNA purification: Heating at 65°C overnight reverses formaldehyde crosslinks. Proteinase K digests proteins. DNA is purified by phenol-chloroform or column purification. (5) Analysis by qPCR: Primers specific to the Gene-Y promoter are used to quantify enrichment by comparing ChIP signal to input (total chromatin) and to a negative control region (known to not bind TF-X). Enrichment > 3-5 fold over IgG control with specificity for the promoter confirms direct binding. (6) Why alternatives are insufficient: EMSA tests binding in vitro with purified protein and naked DNA — it cannot confirm that binding occurs in the chromatin context in vivo. Co-IP tests protein-protein interactions, not protein-DNA. mRNA measurement shows functional regulation but doesn't prove direct binding (could be indirect).

      "options": ["When TPP is abundant, it binds directly to the aptamer domain of the riboswitch in the 5' UTR, inducing a conformational change in the expression platform that either forms a transcription terminator hairpin (terminating transcription prematurely) or sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (blocking ribosome binding and translation initiation)", "The TPP riboswitch encodes a small protein that represses thiamine biosynthesis genes", "TPP modifies the riboswitch RNA by adding a methyl group that blocks transcription", "The riboswitch cleaves itself when TPP binds, destroying the mRNA"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Riboswitches are cis-acting regulatory RNA elements that directly couple metabolite sensing to gene regulation without requiring any protein factors: (1) General structure: Riboswitches consist of two functional domains: the aptamer domain (highly conserved, binds the ligand with high specificity and affinity, typically Kd in nM to low μM range) and the expression platform (less conserved, undergoes conformational switching to affect gene expression). (2) TPP riboswitch specifics: The TPP (thiamine pyrophosphate, also called thiamin diphosphate) riboswitch is the most widely distributed riboswitch class, found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants. Its aptamer domain folds into a complex structure with two parallel helical arms (P2-P3 and P4-P5) connected by a junction. TPP binds in the cleft between the two arms, with the pyrimidine ring recognized by one arm and the pyrophosphate moiety coordinated by Mg2+ ions and recognized by the other arm. (3) Regulation mechanism — two modes: (a) Transcriptional attenuation: In the absence of TPP, the expression platform adopts an anti-terminator conformation, allowing RNA polymerase to read through and transcribe the full mRNA. When TPP binds, the aptamer domain restructures the expression platform into a rho-independent transcription terminator (stem-loop followed by U-rich tract), causing premature transcription termination before the coding region. (b) Translational control: In some riboswitches, TPP binding sequesters the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding site) within a base-paired structure, preventing 30S ribosomal subunit binding and translation initiation. (4) Speed and efficiency: Riboswitches operate co-transcriptionally — the decision to terminate or continue must be made within the kinetic window as RNA polymerase approaches the terminator. This means the ligand binding kinetics (kon rate), not just equilibrium binding affinity, are critical for regulation.

Phosphorylation by CDKs within the AF-1 domain both enhances transcriptional activity AND marks it for ubiquitin-mediated turnover. The 'licensing' model proposes that productive transcription requires a cycle of activator binding, firing (activating transcription), ubiquitination, and degradation — clearing the promoter for the next round. Blocking degradation (with proteasome inhibitors) paradoxically REDUCES transcription. S2 is TRUE: Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) and an N-terminal methionine (M1), each of which can form polyubiquitin chains with distinct topologies and functions. K48 chains adopt a compact conformation recognized by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptors (RPN10/S5a, RPN13). K63 chains adopt an extended, open conformation recognized by different effectors: in NF-κB signaling, K63-linked chains on RIP1/TRAF6 serve as scaffolds to recruit the TAK1 kinase complex (via TAB2/3, which contain K63-specific ubiquitin-binding NZF domains). S3 is TRUE: The 26S proteasome (~2.5 MDa) consists of a 20S core particle (four stacked heptameric rings: α7β7β7α7, with proteolytic activities — chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like — in the β1, β2, β5 subunits) and one or two 19S regulatory particles (containing a base with six AAA-ATPase subunits RPT1-6 for substrate unfolding/translocation, and a lid with DUB activity via RPN11). S4 is FALSE: DUBs are found in BOTH cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear DUBs include USP22 (part of SAGA complex, deubiquitinates H2Bub1 to regulate transcription), BAP1/BRCA1-associated protein 1 (deubiquitinates H2AK119ub, a nuclear tumor suppressor), and USP7/HAUSP (deubiquitinates p53 and MDM2 in the nucleus). There are ~100 DUBs in the human genome distributed across both compartments.",

      "question": "Pioneer transcription factors are distinguished from conventional transcription factors by their unique ability to engage target sites in closed chromatin. What property enables pioneer factors like FOXA1 to access nucleosomal DNA?",
      "options": ["Pioneer factors possess a winged-helix domain structurally similar to linker histone H1, enabling them to bind their recognition motifs on nucleosomal DNA directly; upon binding, they locally displace linker histones and recruit chromatin remodelers to open surrounding chromatin, making it accessible for subsequent binding by other transcription factors", "Pioneer factors are small enough to diffuse through nucleosome pores without needing to bind DNA", "Pioneer factors function identically to conventional transcription factors but are expressed at higher levels", "Pioneer factors cleave histone proteins to expose DNA binding sites"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Pioneer transcription factors are a specialized class of DNA-binding proteins that can initiate chromatin opening at silent loci — a critical function in cell fate determination: (1) Structural basis: FOXA1 (Forkhead box A1, originally called HNF3α) was the first characterized pioneer factor. Its forkhead/winged-helix DNA-binding domain has striking structural similarity to the globular domain of linker histone H1. Both adopt a three-helix bundle plus two wing-like loops. Key differences: while H1 binds nucleosomal DNA at the dyad axis and STABILIZES compact chromatin, FOXA1 binds a similar position but OPENS chromatin. The C-terminal domain of FOXA1 interacts with core histones H3 and H4, stabilizing its binding to nucleosomes. (2) Nucleosome engagement: FOXA1 can bind its recognition motif (TRTTKRY) even when the DNA is wrapped around a nucleosome, because its winged-helix domain makes fewer DNA contacts than many other transcription factors and those contacts can be satisfied by accessible DNA on the nucleosome surface. In contrast, most conventional transcription factors (like glucocorticoid receptor) require nucleosome-free DNA and cannot access their sites in compact chromatin. (3) Chromatin opening: Upon binding nucleosomal DNA, FOXA1: (a) Displaces linker histone H1 through competition for overlapping binding sites on the nucleosome. (b) Locally decompacts chromatin by preventing H1-mediated higher-order folding. (c) Recruits SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes to slide or evict nucleosomes. (d) Creates a locally accessible region that allows other transcription factors (settlers/conventional factors) to bind their now-exposed motifs. (4) Developmental roles: Pioneer factors are critical for cell fate transitions: FOXA1/2 in liver and pancreas development, PU.1 in hematopoiesis, OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 in pluripotency (these are the Yamanaka factors used for iPSC reprogramming), and TP63 in epidermal specification.",

      "question": "In bacteria, two-component signal transduction systems allow cells to respond to environmental changes by regulating gene expression. How does the EnvZ-OmpR system regulate porin gene expression in E. coli in response to osmolarity?",
      "options": ["EnvZ is a transmembrane histidine kinase that autophosphorylates at a conserved histidine residue when osmolarity changes; the phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate on the response regulator OmpR; phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) acts as a transcription factor that differentially activates ompC (high osmolarity) or ompF (low osmolarity) promoters based on the level of OmpR-P", "OmpR directly senses osmolarity and changes conformation without any phosphorylation", "EnvZ is a DNA-binding protein that responds to osmolarity by changing its binding site preference", "The porin genes are constitutively expressed and osmolarity only affects protein folding"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The EnvZ-OmpR system is the paradigm for bacterial two-component signal transduction and gene regulation: (1) Sensor kinase — EnvZ: EnvZ is an inner membrane protein with two transmembrane helices, a periplasmic sensor domain, and cytoplasmic HAMP, DHp (dimerization/histidine phosphotransfer), and CA (catalytic/ATP-binding) domains. Changes in medium osmolarity alter the conformation of the periplasmic domain, which is transmitted through the HAMP domain to regulate the kinase and phosphatase activities of the cytoplasmic domains. At high osmolarity: EnvZ kinase activity predominates — it autophosphorylates at His243 using ATP. At low osmolarity: EnvZ phosphatase activity predominates — it dephosphorylates OmpR-P. (2) Response regulator — OmpR: OmpR consists of a receiver domain (containing the conserved Asp55 that accepts the phosphoryl group from EnvZ-P) and a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. Phosphorylation at Asp55 induces a conformational change that increases OmpR's DNA-binding affinity and promotes dimerization. (3) Differential gene regulation: OmpR-P binds to multiple sites upstream of both ompC and ompF promoters, but with different affinities. At LOW OmpR-P levels (low osmolarity): OmpR-P occupies only high-affinity sites upstream of ompF, activating ompF transcription. ompC sites have lower affinity and are not occupied. Result: OmpF porins (larger pore, allows larger molecules) predominate. At HIGH OmpR-P levels (high osmolarity): High-affinity ompF sites AND lower-affinity ompC sites are both occupied. At ompF, additional OmpR-P binding at a site between the activating sites and the promoter represses ompF transcription. At ompC, the newly occupied sites activate transcription. Result: OmpC porins (smaller pore, restricts large molecules including bile salts) predominate. (4) This concentration-dependent differential regulation of two target genes by a single response regulator is an elegant mechanism for graded environmental responses.",

      "question": "Scientists use CRISPR to delete a 5 kb region containing a predicted super-enhancer located 200 kb upstream of a gene encoding a key cell identity transcription factor. In heterozygous deletion cells (+/Δ), gene expression decreases by approximately 45%. In homozygous deletion cells (Δ/Δ), expression drops by 90%. However, when they delete a single constituent enhancer element (800 bp) within the super-enhancer, expression drops by only 10%. What do these results reveal about super-enhancer function?",
      "options": ["Super-enhancers function as integrated units where individual constituent enhancers contribute synergistically rather than additively; deleting the entire super-enhancer causes near-complete loss of expression, but removing a single component has a modest effect because the remaining enhancers partially compensate, suggesting both functional redundancy and cooperative interactions among constituent elements", "The 800 bp enhancer is the only functional element and the 90% reduction is due to off-target CRISPR effects", "Super-enhancers have no regulatory function and the expression changes are caused by deleting neighboring genes", "Each enhancer in the super-enhancer independently drives 20% of expression in a purely additive manner"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This experiment illuminates the functional architecture of super-enhancers: (1) Super-enhancer definition: Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of constituent enhancer elements (typically spanning 10-50 kb) that are densely loaded with Mediator, BRD4, H3K27ac, and master transcription factors. They were defined by Young and colleagues (2013) as regions with exceptionally high levels of these marks (typically in the top 2-5% genome-wide). SEs preferentially regulate genes critical for cell identity (lineage-defining transcription factors, signaling genes) and are disproportionately sensitive to perturbation. (2) Interpreting the deletion results: Heterozygous deletion (+/Δ): 45% reduction. If both alleles contributed equally, losing one would predict 50% reduction. The observed 45% is close, suggesting minimal trans-compensation from the remaining allele. Homozygous deletion (Δ/Δ): 90% reduction. Near-complete loss demonstrates the SE is the dominant regulatory element for this gene. The remaining 10% may come from the basal promoter activity or distant minor enhancers. Single constituent deletion: Only 10% reduction. This reveals: (a) No single enhancer is solely responsible. (b) Remaining enhancers partially compensate (functional redundancy). (c) The system is robust to individual perturbations — a property called regulatory buffering. (3) Synergistic vs. additive models: If the SE had 6 constituent enhancers and each contributed equally and additively, deleting one would reduce expression by ~16.7% (1/6). The observed 10% reduction is less than expected for a purely additive model, suggesting compensatory interactions. Conversely, deleting ALL of them causes 90% loss (not 100%), indicating some promoter-autonomous activity. (4) Phase separation model: Current evidence suggests SEs function through phase-separated condensates — the dense concentration of transcription factors, Mediator, and BRD4 forms liquid droplets that concentrate the transcriptional machinery. Losing one constituent reduces the condensate slightly (buffered by the remaining components), but losing the entire SE eliminates the condensate entirely (catastrophic loss).",

      "question": "RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation is regulated at multiple levels. What is promoter-proximal pausing, and what factor is responsible for releasing the paused polymerase into productive elongation?",
      "options": ["After initiating transcription and synthesizing 20-60 nucleotides, RNA Pol II pauses due to the actions of NELF (Negative Elongation Factor) and DSIF (DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor); the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T) phosphorylates the Pol II CTD at Ser2, NELF, and the SPT5 subunit of DSIF, converting DSIF into a positive factor and releasing NELF, allowing productive elongation", "Promoter-proximal pausing occurs because the DNA template is physically blocked by nucleosomes that cannot be traversed", "TFIIS is the sole factor that releases paused polymerase by cleaving the nascent RNA", "Pausing occurs only in yeast and is not found in metazoan gene regulation"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Promoter-proximal pausing is a widespread regulatory mechanism in metazoans, affecting 30-50% of all genes, and serves as a major rate-limiting step in gene expression: (1) Establishment of pausing: After RNA Pol II clears the promoter and synthesizes 20-60 nucleotides of nascent RNA, it encounters a checkpoint established by two negative factors: NELF (Negative Elongation Factor): a four-subunit complex (NELF-A, -B, -C/D, -E) that directly contacts the nascent RNA emerging from the Pol II exit channel and the polymerase itself, inhibiting further elongation. DSIF (DRB Sensitivity-Inducing Factor): a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5 that associates with Pol II shortly after initiation. DSIF stabilizes the NELF-Pol II interaction and together they establish a stable paused complex. (2) Stable paused complex: The paused Pol II maintains an open promoter architecture (nucleosome-depleted region), keeping the gene in a transcription-competent state. The paused polymerase also maintains a bubble of unwound DNA (~12 bp) and holds the nascent RNA stably. This is NOT the same as promoter opening — the gene is already being transcribed, just held at a checkpoint. (3) Release by P-TEFb: The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) consists of CDK9 (a cyclin-dependent kinase) and Cyclin T1 (or T2/K). P-TEFb is recruited to paused genes by signal-responsive transcription factors, BRD4, or the super elongation complex (SEC). CDK9 phosphorylates three key substrates: (a) RNA Pol II CTD at Serine 2 of heptad repeats — this mark recruits splicing factors, the polyadenylation machinery, and histone modifiers (SET2/SETD2 for H3K36me3). (b) SPT5 subunit of DSIF — converting DSIF from a negative to a positive elongation factor that now promotes processivity. (c) NELF-E — causing NELF dissociation from the elongation complex. (4) Consequence: Pol II is released into productive elongation, moving at ~2-4 kb/min through the gene body. (5) Biological significance: Pausing provides a mechanism for rapid, synchronous gene induction (genes are pre-loaded with Pol II and need only release), and enables signal integration at the pause-release step.",

      "options": ["ChIP-exo (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with exonuclease treatment): after standard ChIP, treat the immunoprecipitated DNA with lambda exonuclease to digest unprotected DNA from the 5' ends up to the protein-DNA crosslink point, then sequence; this trims the DNA to within a few nucleotides of the actual binding site, providing near-single-nucleotide resolution genome-wide", "Standard ChIP-seq with 200-500 bp fragment sizes, providing resolution of several hundred base pairs", "DNase-seq to map all open chromatin regions and infer TF binding computationally", "Yeast one-hybrid screening of the entire genome"],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "ChIP-exo represents the highest-resolution genome-wide protein-DNA binding mapping technique: (1) Standard ChIP-seq limitations: In conventional ChIP-seq, chromatin is fragmented to 200-500 bp by sonication. After immunoprecipitation, both specifically and non-specifically enriched DNA fragments are sequenced. The actual binding site is somewhere within each fragment, so resolution is limited to ~200-300 bp (determined by the average fragment size minus a modeled peak center). Even with computational peak-calling, resolution is typically 50-100 bp at best. (2) ChIP-exo principle (developed by Frank Pugh, 2011): After standard ChIP steps (crosslinking, sonication, immunoprecipitation, and stringent washing), the key innovation is treating the bead-bound, immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments with lambda exonuclease (5'-to-3' exonuclease). Lambda exonuclease digests the 5' ends of each DNA strand procissively until it reaches a physical block — the crosslinked protein or the protein-DNA interface. This trims all non-crosslinked DNA away, leaving only the DNA segment directly protected by the crosslinked protein. (3) Resolution: After exonuclease trimming, the 5' boundary of each remaining DNA fragment is within 0-5 nucleotides of the crosslink (typically at the edge of the protein-DNA contact). When millions of such trimmed fragments are sequenced and mapped, the 5' read positions cluster precisely at the borders of the binding site, creating sharp peaks that define the binding footprint at near-nucleotide resolution. (4) Advantages over ChIP-seq: 5-10x better resolution (single nucleotide vs. ~200 bp), dramatically reduced background (exonuclease removes non-specific DNA), ability to distinguish closely spaced binding events, and more accurate motif identification. (5) Related methods: CUT&RUN (uses protein A-MNase targeted by antibody to cleave DNA near binding sites, resolution ~50 bp), CUT&Tag (uses protein A-Tn5 transposase, ~50-100 bp resolution).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Circular RNAs represent a newly appreciated class of regulatory molecules with distinct properties and functions: (1) Biogenesis: circRNAs are generated by backsplicing — a non-canonical splicing event where the 3' splice site (splice acceptor) of a downstream exon joins to the 5' splice site (splice donor) of an upstream exon, creating a covalently closed circular molecule. Backsplicing is promoted by: inverted repeat elements (Alu elements in humans) flanking the circularized exons that bring splice sites into proximity through RNA base-pairing, and RNA-binding proteins (e.g., Muscleblind, QKI) that bridge flanking introns. (2) Properties of circRNAs: Resistance to exonuclease degradation (no free 5' or 3' ends, so they are resistant to XRN1 and the exosome), resulting in high stability (half-lives of >24-48 hours vs. ~7 hours for linear mRNAs). They lack a 5' cap and poly-A tail, so they are generally not translated (with rare exceptions using IRES-mediated initiation). (3) ciRS-7/CDR1as: This circRNA is the best-characterized miRNA sponge. It is approximately 1.5 kb and is highly expressed in the mammalian brain. It contains >70 conserved binding sites for miR-7 and one binding site for miR-671. The miR-7 sites are complementary enough for RISC binding and sequestration but have central mismatches that prevent AGO2-mediated cleavage (slicing). Thus, ciRS-7 effectively titrates miR-7 away from its endogenous targets. The single miR-671 site is fully complementary and allows AGO2 cleavage, which may regulate ciRS-7 levels. (4) Functional consequence: By sponging miR-7, ciRS-7 indirectly upregulates miR-7 target genes, which include SNCA (alpha-synuclein, involved in Parkinson disease), EGFR, and IRS2. Knockout of ciRS-7 in mice causes increased miR-7 activity, reduced expression of miR-7 targets, and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. (5) Other circRNA functions: acting as protein scaffolds, regulating parental gene transcription (cis-regulation by competing with canonical splicing), and in rare cases, encoding small peptides via IRES-dependent translation.",

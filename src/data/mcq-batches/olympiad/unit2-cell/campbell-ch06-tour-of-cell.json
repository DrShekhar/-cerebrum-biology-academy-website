      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Proteins with a KKXX motif at their C-terminus are ER-resident membrane proteins. Although they may transiently escape to the cis-Golgi via anterograde COPII vesicles, the KKXX motif is recognized by COPI coat proteins, which package these proteins into retrograde vesicles returning them to the ER. This continuous retrieval cycle means the steady-state concentration is highest in the ER. The cis-Golgi (B) would show some labeling since the protein transiently visits it, but retrieval ensures the ER has the highest density. The trans-Golgi network (C) and plasma membrane (D) would show negligible labeling because COPI-mediated retrieval occurs before the protein progresses that far in the secretory pathway.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Transcription of rRNA by RNA polymerase I in the nucleolus is a nuclear process that does not depend on cytoskeletal elements. It relies on transcription factors, polymerases, and template DNA, none of which require microtubules or actin filaments. Cytokinesis (A) requires an actin-myosin contractile ring disrupted by cytochalasin B. Chromosome segregation (B) requires spindle microtubules disrupted by colchicine. Vesicle transport from the Golgi (D) requires microtubule-based motor proteins (kinesins) for long-range transport and actin for short-range cortical transport, so both drugs would impair it. Thus, transcription remains unaffected by either drug.",

      "explanation": "COPI coat proteins mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi back to the ER, retrieving ER-resident proteins that have escaped and recycling SNARE proteins and cargo receptors. COPII (A) mediates anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi, which is the opposite direction. Clathrin with AP-1 adaptors (C) operates at the trans-Golgi network for sorting proteins to endosomes and lysosomes. Clathrin with AP-2 adaptors (D) functions at the plasma membrane during receptor-mediated endocytosis. Understanding the directionality and specificity of these coat proteins is essential for predicting how disruption of each pathway affects protein sorting.",

The cell wall composed of chitin is diagnostic of fungi. Plant cells (A) have cell walls made of cellulose, not chitin, and typically possess chloroplasts. The 80S ribosomes confirm eukaryotic identity (prokaryotes have 70S). Chitin is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and is the defining structural polysaccharide of fungal cell walls, also found in arthropod exoskeletons but not in plant or animal cells.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "For a sphere, surface area = 4 pi r^2 and volume = (4/3) pi r^3, so the SA:V ratio = 3/r. When the diameter doubles from 10 to 20 micrometers, the radius doubles from 5 to 10 micrometers. The SA:V ratio changes from 3/5 = 0.6 to 3/10 = 0.3, a decrease by a factor of 2. This explains why larger cells face challenges in nutrient uptake and waste removal, as the membrane surface area grows more slowly than the cytoplasmic volume. This constraint drives adaptations like microvilli, membrane folding, and multinucleate cells. Options A, C, and D reflect incorrect calculations of how surface area and volume scale with radius.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The nuclear lamina is a meshwork of intermediate filament proteins called lamins (types A, B, and C) that line the inner surface of the inner nuclear membrane. It provides structural support to maintain nuclear shape, anchors chromatin to the nuclear periphery (influencing gene expression), and helps organize nuclear pore complexes. During mitosis, phosphorylation of lamins causes disassembly of the lamina, facilitating nuclear envelope breakdown. Mutations in lamin A cause laminopathies including progeria. The lamina is not composed of actin (B) or microtubules (C), and it is not a lipid bilayer (D) but rather a proteinaceous meshwork.",

S2 is FALSE: Ribosomes associate with the rough ER only when translating mRNAs encoding proteins with ER signal sequences; free ribosomes and ER-bound ribosomes are interchangeable. S3 is TRUE: The ER lumen is continuous with the space between the two nuclear envelope membranes and topologically equivalent to the outside of the cell, which is why secretory proteins synthesized in the ER lumen are eventually released extracellularly. S4 is FALSE: SRP binds the signal sequence co-translationally as it emerges from the ribosome, not after translation is complete; SRP binding actually pauses translation until the ribosome-SRP complex docks with the SRP receptor on the ER membrane.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Peroxisomal import is unique because the cytosolic receptors Pex5 (for PTS1 signals) and Pex7 (for PTS2 signals) bind cargo proteins in the cytosol and escort them to the peroxisomal membrane, where they interact with docking proteins (Pex13, Pex14). The receptor-cargo complex is then translocated through a transient pore formed by Pex5 oligomerization that can expand sufficiently to accommodate fully folded proteins and even oligomeric complexes. After cargo release in the matrix, the receptor is recycled back to the cytosol in a ubiquitin-dependent process. Mitochondrial TOM/TIM complexes have narrow channels requiring unfolded proteins. Option A is partially true but does not explain the mechanism. Options C and D are incorrect descriptions of peroxisomal import.",

      "options": [
        "The ER and cytosol share a common pH because they are connected by open channels",
        "The progressive acidification from early endosome to lysosome is driven by V-type H+-ATPases that are increasingly active in later compartments",

        "Lysosomes maintain acidic pH through passive diffusion of H+ ions across their membrane"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The mitochondrial matrix pH of 7.8 compared to cytosolic pH of 7.2 reflects the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), which pumps protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. This creates both a chemical gradient (delta pH) and an electrical gradient (delta psi) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, collectively forming the proton-motive force that drives ATP synthase. Option A is incorrect because the ER and cytosol are not connected by open channels; rather, small molecules can equilibrate through translocon pores. Option B oversimplifies the mechanism; V-type ATPases have similar intrinsic activity, but the acidification depends on the balance between proton pumping and proton leakage, as well as the buffering capacity of each compartment. Option D is wrong because lysosomal acidification is ATP-dependent via V-type ATPases, not passive diffusion.",

      "explanation": "Conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) is a plus-end-directed motor that transports cargo from the cell center (where microtubule minus ends are anchored at the centrosome/MTOC) toward the cell periphery (where plus ends extend). Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed motor that transports cargo from the periphery toward the cell center. This directional difference is critical for organelle positioning: kinesin moves secretory vesicles outward toward the plasma membrane, while dynein moves endosomes inward and positions the Golgi apparatus near the centrosome.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) is an uncoupler that dissipates the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, eliminating both the delta pH and delta psi components of the proton-motive force. If mitochondrial protein import requires the electrochemical gradient, CCCP-treated mitochondria should show dramatically reduced import of the radiolabeled matrix protein compared to untreated controls. This directly tests the hypothesis. Removing ATP (B) would test ATP dependence but not specifically the electrochemical gradient, and mtHsp70 requires ATP, confounding interpretation. Knocking down TOM40 (C) tests the role of the outer membrane translocase, not the electrochemical gradient. Temperature change (D) would affect many processes non-specifically, making it difficult to attribute effects to the electrochemical gradient alone.",

Unlike mitochondria and chloroplasts, which retain remnant genomes from their endosymbiotic ancestors and replicate their circular DNA independently, peroxisomes derive all their proteins from nuclear-encoded genes. Peroxisomal proteins are synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and imported post-translationally via PTS1 and PTS2 targeting signals recognized by Pex5 and Pex7 receptors respectively. Peroxisomes can divide by fission (using Pex11 and dynamin-related proteins), but they can also arise de novo from the ER.

S2 is TRUE: N-linked glycosylation is initiated in the ER by oligosaccharyltransferase transferring a 14-sugar precursor to asparagine residues, and the glycan is then extensively modified by trimming and addition of sugars in sequential Golgi compartments. S3 is TRUE: In the cis-Golgi network, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase recognizes lysosomal hydrolases and adds GlcNAc-phosphate to mannose residues; a second enzyme then removes GlcNAc to expose the mannose-6-phosphate signal.

      "explanation": "During autophagy, the autophagosome (a double-membrane vesicle formed by the phagophore/isolation membrane) engulfs cytoplasmic cargo including damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and pathogens. The autophagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form an autolysosome, where lysosomal hydrolases (proteases, lipases, glycosidases, nucleases) operating at acidic pH degrade the contents. The breakdown products (amino acids, fatty acids, sugars) are transported back to the cytosol for reuse. Peroxisomes (A) are themselves targets of selective autophagy (pexophagy) and do not degrade autophagosomal contents. The smooth ER (C) contributes membrane to phagophore formation but does not fuse with mature autophagosomes. While autophagosomes can fuse with late endosomes to form amphisomes, the final degradation occurs after lysosome fusion (D is incorrect).",

Gap junctions in animal cells are formed by connexin hexamers (connexons) that align between adjacent cells, creating channels permitting passage of molecules up to about 1,000 Da (ions, amino acids, nucleotides, second messengers like cAMP and IP3). Option A is wrong because plasmodesmata do not contain connexins (those are animal-specific). Option B underestimates plasmodesmata capacity. Option D reverses the capabilities.",

This is consistent with the ER's central roles in protein synthesis and folding (rough ER), lipid synthesis, detoxification (smooth ER is particularly abundant in hepatocytes for drug metabolism), and calcium storage. The plasma membrane (A) constitutes only 2% of total membrane, which is counterintuitive but reflects the massive amplification of internal membranes in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondrial membranes (32%) are the second largest system, reflecting the high metabolic demands of hepatocytes (C is incorrect). The Golgi (D) accounts for only 7%.

The endomembrane system (ER, Golgi, endosomes, lysosomes) provides internal compartmentalization that: (1) creates distinct biochemical environments (e.g., oxidizing ER lumen vs. reducing cytosol; acidic lysosomes vs. neutral cytoplasm); (2) spatially separates biosynthetic and degradative pathways; (3) enables efficient protein sorting and quality control; (4) provides enormous membrane surface area for membrane-bound enzyme systems. Prokaryotes can secrete proteins directly across their plasma membrane using Sec and Tat pathways (A is wrong). Prokaryotes do have a Sec translocon homologous to the eukaryotic one (D is wrong).

Hydroxylation is essential for proper triple helix stability through hydrogen bonding. Three pro-alpha chains then assemble into a triple-helical procollagen molecule, stabilized by disulfide bonds in the C-propeptide domain. Procollagen is secreted, and extracellular procollagen peptidases cleave the N- and C-terminal propeptides to generate tropocollagen, which self-assembles into collagen fibrils.

      "explanation": "S1 is FALSE: Mitochondrial distribution during cell division is not entirely random. While there is a stochastic component, mitochondria associate with cytoskeletal elements (particularly actin in yeast and microtubules in animal cells) that help ensure roughly equal partitioning. In budding yeast, specific mitochondrial transport mechanisms actively move mitochondria into the bud. S2 is TRUE: The ER network remains largely intact during mitosis (unlike the Golgi) and is partitioned to daughter cells in association with the spindle and through its connections to the nuclear envelope remnants. S3 is TRUE: The Golgi undergoes extensive fragmentation during prophase, driven by CDK1 and PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of Golgi structural proteins (GM130, GRASP55, GRASP65). The resulting Golgi fragments and vesicles are distributed and then reassemble through dephosphorylation in telophase. S4 is FALSE: Centrosomes are inherited; the mother cell's two centrioles each serve as templates for daughter centriole assembly during S phase (semi-conservative duplication), ensuring each daughter cell inherits one centrosome.",

      "options": [
        "Transit from Golgi to secretion takes approximately 5 minutes",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data reveal classic regulated secretion kinetics in pancreatic acinar cells. After the pulse, label moves from ER (90% at t=0) through the Golgi (peaking at 60% at t=15) to zymogen granules (peaking at 55% at t=30). Importantly, zymogen granules accumulate label (reaching 55% by 30 min) but then gradually decrease as protein is secreted. The slow, continuous release of label into the secreted fraction (rather than a sudden burst) indicates ongoing constitutive/basal secretion plus possible low-level stimulation. In vivo, the majority of digestive enzyme secretion is triggered by hormonal stimulation (CCK, secretin), causing mass exocytosis of stored zymogen granules. The data show that without strong stimulation, protein exits slowly. The pathway is clearly directional (D is wrong), does not bypass the Golgi (C is wrong), and the transit time is much longer than 5 minutes (A is wrong).",

Mitochondrial ribosomes (55S in mammals, but evolutionarily derived from bacterial 70S ribosomes) retain structural similarity in their large subunit that allows chloramphenicol binding, consistent with the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria from alpha-proteobacteria. Cytoplasmic eukaryotic ribosomes (80S) have a 60S large subunit with 28S rRNA that has a different structure at the chloramphenicol binding site, conferring resistance. This selective toxicity is clinically relevant: prolonged chloramphenicol use can cause bone marrow suppression partly through inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis in hematopoietic cells. The outer membrane is permeable via porins (A is wrong). The genetic code difference (C) is unrelated to antibiotic sensitivity. Chloramphenicol does not degrade mRNA (D).",

      "explanation": "Immunogold labeling combined with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides the most definitive evidence for NPC localization because it: (1) directly visualizes the protein's location at NPCs at near-molecular resolution; (2) can determine sub-NPC positioning (cytoplasmic face, central channel, nuclear basket); and (3) preserves native structure unlike conventional EM. Immunofluorescence (A) has insufficient resolution (~200 nm) to distinguish NPC from general nuclear envelope localization. Increased nuclear import rate upon overexpression (C) could indicate a transport factor rather than an NPC component. Co-immunoprecipitation with histones (D) would suggest chromatin association, not NPC localization. Additional supporting evidence would include mass spectrometry of purified NPCs, genetic interactions with known nucleoporins, and loss of NPC integrity upon depletion.",

This ensures that PS and PE are concentrated in the inner leaflet while sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and glycolipids dominate the outer leaflet. Loss of this asymmetry, particularly the exposure of PS on the outer leaflet, serves as an 'eat me' signal for phagocytes during apoptosis (recognized by receptors like TIM-4). Scramblases (C) are calcium-activated enzymes that dissipate asymmetry (bidirectionally randomizing lipids), not maintain it \u2014 they are activated during apoptosis and platelet activation. Phospholipase A2 (A) cleaves fatty acids and does not translocate lipids between leaflets. Sphingomyelinase (D) is a degradative enzyme, not a translocator.",

      "explanation": "The deltaF508 CFTR mutation (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in nucleotide-binding domain 1) causes misfolding that is detected by the ER quality control system. The calnexin/calreticulin cycle is central: calnexin (membrane-bound) and calreticulin (soluble) are lectin chaperones that bind monoglucosylated N-glycans on newly synthesized glycoproteins, promoting proper folding. When glucosidase II removes the glucose, the protein is released. If it remains misfolded, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) re-adds glucose, sending it back into the cycle. After repeated failed folding attempts, the mannose residues are progressively trimmed by ER mannosidase I, creating a signal recognized by EDEM and OS-9, which target the protein for ERAD and proteasomal degradation. The proteasome is cytoplasmic, not at the plasma membrane (A). Autophagy (B) is not the primary mechanism. The Golgi (D) never sees the misfolded protein because ER retention prevents its transport.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The transferrin cycle is unique among receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways. At the plasma membrane (pH 7.4), iron-loaded holo-transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor with high affinity. After internalization into early endosomes (pH ~6.0), the acidic environment causes conformational changes in transferrin that release the two bound Fe3+ ions (which are reduced to Fe2+ by STEAP3 reductase and transported into the cytosol by DMT1). Crucially, unlike most ligands that dissociate from their receptors at acidic pH, apo-transferrin (iron-free) actually binds MORE tightly to the transferrin receptor at acidic pH. The apo-transferrin-receptor complex is recycled to the cell surface, where the neutral pH of the extracellular fluid causes apo-transferrin to dissociate and be released back into the blood to capture more iron. Neither transferrin nor the receptor is degraded (A and B are wrong). Option C incorrectly states that both are recycled independently.",

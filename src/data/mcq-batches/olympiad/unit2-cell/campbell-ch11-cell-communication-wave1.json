      "options": [
        "Persistent activation of phospholipase C leads to excessive IP3 production and uncontrolled Ca2+ release from the ER",
        "Constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to elevated cAMP, which activates PKA and opens CFTR chloride channels in intestinal epithelial cells",
        "Permanent activation of Ras-MAPK signaling induces uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal crypt cells",
        "Irreversible activation of phosphodiesterase depletes cyclic nucleotides, causing loss of tight junction integrity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates the alpha subunit of Gs, preventing it from hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. The constitutively active Gs-alpha continuously stimulates adenylyl cyclase, producing abnormally high levels of cAMP. Elevated cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates and opens CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) chloride channels in intestinal epithelial cells. Chloride efflux into the intestinal lumen drives osmotic water secretion, producing the profuse watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera. Option A is incorrect because Gs couples to adenylyl cyclase, not phospholipase C (which is activated by Gq). Option C is incorrect because MAPK signaling is downstream of RTKs, not GPCRs via Gs.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SH2 (Src Homology 2) domains specifically bind to phosphotyrosine residues on activated RTKs. Grb2 is an adaptor protein that contains one SH2 domain (which binds phosphotyrosine on the RTK) and two SH3 domains (which bind proline-rich motifs on Sos, a Ras-GEF). The SH3 domains on Grb2 do not bind phosphotyrosine. PH domains bind phosphoinositides in the membrane, not phosphotyrosine. PDZ domains recognize C-terminal peptide sequences and are involved in scaffolding at synapses and tight junctions.",

      "question": "A researcher finds that adding a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GTPgammaS) to a cell-free system containing purified Gs protein and adenylyl cyclase causes sustained cAMP production. What does this demonstrate about the Gs alpha subunit?",
      "options": [
        "The alpha subunit's intrinsic GTPase activity normally terminates signaling, and preventing GTP hydrolysis locks it in the active state",
        "The alpha subunit requires GDP binding to activate adenylyl cyclase",
        "GTPgammaS acts as a competitive inhibitor at the adenylyl cyclase catalytic site",
        "The beta-gamma subunit complex is the true activator of adenylyl cyclase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Gs alpha subunit has intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP, returning the subunit to its inactive state and terminating the signal. GTPgammaS is a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog that binds to the alpha subunit but cannot be hydrolyzed. This locks Gs-alpha in the active, GTP-bound conformation, leading to persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase and sustained cAMP production. This experiment elegantly demonstrates that the built-in GTPase acts as a molecular timer. Option B is incorrect because GDP-bound alpha is the inactive form. Option C is wrong because GTPgammaS binds to Gs-alpha, not adenylyl cyclase. While beta-gamma can activate certain effectors, in this canonical pathway it is the alpha subunit that activates adenylyl cyclase.",

        "Beta-catenin is cleaved by gamma-secretase and the intracellular domain enters the nucleus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In the absence of Wnt signaling, the destruction complex (comprising APC, Axin, CK1alpha, and GSK-3beta) phosphorylates beta-catenin at specific serine and threonine residues. CK1alpha phosphorylates Ser45 first, priming subsequent phosphorylation by GSK-3beta at Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33. Phosphorylated beta-catenin is recognized by beta-TrCP (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the 26S proteasome. This keeps cytoplasmic beta-catenin levels low and prevents inappropriate gene activation. Option A describes what happens when Wnt IS present. Option B is backwards. Option D describes Notch signaling, not Wnt.",

      "options": [
        "cAMP levels decrease because Gi can no longer inhibit phosphodiesterase",
        "cAMP levels remain unchanged because pertussis toxin simultaneously inhibits Gs",
        "cAMP levels oscillate because the feedback loop between Gi and Gs is disrupted",
        "cAMP levels increase because the inhibitory restraint on adenylyl cyclase is removed while Gs remains active"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the Gi alpha subunit, locking it in the GDP-bound (inactive) state so it cannot be activated by receptor binding. Since Gi normally inhibits adenylyl cyclase, removing this inhibitory restraint means that any ongoing Gs stimulation proceeds unopposed, leading to elevated cAMP levels. This is why Bordetella pertussis causes increased cAMP in respiratory epithelial cells, contributing to the symptoms of whooping cough. Note the contrast with cholera toxin: cholera toxin constitutively activates Gs (locks ON), while pertussis toxin inactivates Gi (removes the brake) — both result in elevated cAMP but by different mechanisms.",

      "question": "Signal amplification in the GPCR-cAMP pathway occurs at multiple steps. If one ligand-bound receptor activates 10 Gs proteins, each Gs protein activates 1 adenylyl cyclase that produces 100 cAMP molecules, and each PKA phosphorylates 50 substrate molecules, approximately how many substrate molecules are ultimately affected by a single ligand binding event?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Signal amplification is multiplicative at each step of the cascade. One ligand activates 1 receptor, which activates 10 Gs proteins. Each Gs activates 1 adenylyl cyclase producing 100 cAMP each (total: 10 x 100 = 1,000 cAMP). Each cAMP activates PKA (2 cAMP per regulatory subunit, but simplifying to 1,000 activated PKA catalytic subunits for this calculation). Each PKA phosphorylates 50 substrates: 1,000 x 50 = 50,000 substrate molecules. This enormous amplification — from 1 ligand to 50,000 phosphorylation events — explains why cells can respond to extremely low concentrations of hormones (picomolar to nanomolar).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis is triggered by intracellular stress signals (DNA damage, ER stress, growth factor withdrawal). Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane, forming pores that cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This releases cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1). Apaf-1 oligomerizes with cytochrome c and dATP to form the apoptosome, a wheel-shaped heptameric complex that recruits and activates procaspase-9 (an initiator caspase). Active caspase-9 then cleaves and activates executioner caspases-3 and -7. Option A describes the extrinsic pathway component. Option C is incorrect because DISC formation occurs at death receptors on the plasma membrane, not mitochondria.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Notch signaling requires regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). When Delta or Jagged on the signal-sending cell binds Notch on the adjacent cell, endocytosis by the sending cell exerts a mechanical pulling force that exposes the S2 cleavage site. An ADAM family metalloprotease (ADAM10 or TACE/ADAM17) cleaves at S2, removing the extracellular domain. The remaining transmembrane stub is then cleaved within the membrane by gamma-secretase (the same presenilin-containing complex that processes APP in Alzheimer's disease) at the S3 site, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus and converts the CSL/RBP-Jk transcriptional repressor into an activator of Notch target genes like Hes and Hey.",

        "The MAPK cascade becomes more efficient because enzymes can freely diffuse and find substrates faster",

        "All MAPK signaling in the cell is permanently abolished"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Scaffolding proteins ensure signal specificity by physically tethering specific combinations of kinases in a MAPK module. In yeast, Ste5 organizes Ste11 (MEKK), Ste7 (MEK), and Fus3 (MAPK) specifically for the mating response. Importantly, Ste11 is shared between the mating pathway and the osmolarity (HOG) pathway. Without Ste5, the shared component Ste11 could inadvertently activate the wrong downstream MAPK cascade, causing cross-talk and inappropriate cellular responses. This demonstrates that scaffolding proteins solve the problem of signal specificity when components are shared between different pathways. Option A is incorrect because removing the scaffold actually reduces efficiency and specificity. Option D is wrong because only the Ste5-dependent pathway would be directly affected.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "PLCbeta cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: (1) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a small water-soluble molecule that diffuses through the cytosol and binds IP3 receptors (ligand-gated Ca2+ channels) on the ER, causing Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm; and (2) diacylglycerol (DAG), which remains embedded in the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C (PKC). Crucially, PKC requires both DAG and Ca2+ (released by IP3) for full activation, illustrating how the two branches of the PIP2 pathway converge. Option A is wrong because IP3 binds its own receptor on the ER, not calmodulin directly. Option B incorrectly assigns IP3 to cAMP production. Option D confuses the pathways entirely.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Most RTKs are monomers that dimerize upon ligand binding (some, like the insulin receptor, are pre-formed dimers). Dimerization brings the cytoplasmic kinase domains into proximity, enabling transautophosphorylation (each subunit phosphorylates the other). S2: TRUE — Sos is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes GDP-to-GTP exchange on Ras, activating it. Ras has weak intrinsic GTPase activity that is dramatically enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs like NF1/neurofibromin), which accelerate GTP hydrolysis 10,000-fold to terminate signaling. S3: FALSE — MEK phosphorylates ERK on BOTH a threonine and a tyrosine residue (Thr-Glu-Tyr motif), making MEK a dual-specificity kinase. This dual phosphorylation is required for full ERK activation. S4: TRUE — Oncogenic Ras mutations (commonly at codons 12, 13, or 61, e.g., G12V) impair GTPase activity, preventing GTP hydrolysis. Ras remains locked in the active GTP-bound state, continuously driving the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and promoting cell proliferation. Approximately 30% of human cancers harbor Ras mutations.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP + PPi. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze cAMP to 5'-AMP, terminating the signal. Caffeine and theophylline inhibit PDEs, prolonging cAMP-dependent signaling. Sildenafil (Viagra) specifically inhibits PDE5, which degrades cGMP. S2: TRUE — Resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ is ~100 nM; upon signaling it rises to ~1 microM. Ca2+ binds calmodulin (CaM), causing a conformational change that exposes hydrophobic surfaces. The Ca2+-CaM complex activates numerous targets including CaM-kinase II (CaMKII), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and calcineurin. S3: FALSE — cGMP is produced by TWO types of guanylyl cyclase: (1) soluble/cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase activated by nitric oxide (NO), and (2) membrane-bound receptor guanylyl cyclases activated by peptide ligands like ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). Furthermore, cGMP targets include not only PKG but also cGMP-gated ion channels (crucial in phototransduction) and certain PDEs. S4: TRUE — IP3 is rapidly metabolized either by phosphorylation (IP3 kinase converts it to IP4) or by dephosphorylation (IP3 phosphatase converts it to IP2).

They phosphorylate serine and threonine residues primarily in the C-terminal tail and third intracellular loop. This phosphorylation creates a binding platform for beta-arrestins. S2: TRUE — Beta-arrestin (arrestin-2 and arrestin-3) sterically prevents G protein coupling by occupying the same intracellular cavity. Simultaneously, beta-arrestin acts as an adaptor for clathrin and AP2, promoting receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits. Beta-arrestin can also serve as a signaling scaffold for MAPK pathways. S3: TRUE — After internalization into endosomes, receptors can be recycled back to the surface (resensitization) or sorted to lysosomes for degradation (downregulation). Lysosomal degradation permanently removes receptors, reducing the total receptor number and the cell's sensitivity to further stimulation. This occurs during prolonged or repeated stimulation.

High local concentration of procaspase-8 enables proximity-induced dimerization and autoproteolytic activation. S2: FALSE — Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are ANTI-apoptotic proteins that reside on the mitochondrial outer membrane and prevent Bax/Bak oligomerization, thus blocking cytochrome c release. The PRO-apoptotic effectors that form pores are Bax and Bak. BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, Bad, PUMA, NOXA) are pro-apoptotic sensors that activate Bax/Bak or neutralize Bcl-2/Bcl-XL.

      "correctAnswer": "TTTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Patched (Ptch1) is a 12-pass transmembrane protein that constitutively inhibits Smoothened (Smo), a 7-pass transmembrane protein. Without Hh ligand, Ptch prevents Smo from accumulating in the primary cilium. The full-length Gli proteins (Gli2/3) are processed by the proteasome into truncated repressor forms (GliR) that silence Hh target genes. S2: TRUE — Wnt binding to Frizzled and LRP5/6 leads to Dishevelled (Dvl) activation, which recruits the destruction complex components to the membrane. Axin binds phosphorylated LRP5/6, effectively disassembling the destruction complex. Without active destruction complex, beta-catenin accumulates, enters the nucleus, and binds TCF/LEF to activate target genes. S3: TRUE — In the Hh pathway, Gli3 (and to some extent Gli2) is partially degraded by the proteasome to generate repressor forms. In the Wnt pathway, beta-catenin is ubiquitinated by beta-TrCP and degraded by the proteasome. Both pathways rely on proteasomal processing/degradation of key transcription factors when the pathway is off. S4: TRUE — Activating mutations in Smoothened or loss-of-function mutations in Patched cause ligand-independent pathway activation and are common in basal cell carcinoma (the most common human cancer). APC loss-of-function mutations (found in >80% of colorectal cancers) prevent beta-catenin destruction, causing constitutive Wnt target gene activation.",

      "correctAnswer": "TFTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Epinephrine (adrenaline) acts through multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes: beta1, beta2 (Gs-coupled, increase cAMP), alpha1 (Gq-coupled, increase IP3/Ca2+), and alpha2 (Gi-coupled, decrease cAMP). The net cellular response depends on the receptor expression profile, which varies by tissue. This explains why epinephrine can simultaneously stimulate the heart (beta1) and constrict some blood vessels (alpha1). S2: FALSE — PKA actually phosphorylates Raf-1 at Ser259, which INHIBITS Raf activity in most cell types (e.g., fibroblasts). This represents inhibitory cross-talk where the cAMP pathway dampens MAPK signaling. However, in some cell types (e.g., certain neurons), cAMP activates MAPK via Epac/Rap1, illustrating cell-type-specific signaling. S3: TRUE — Calcium released by IP3 can activate calcium-sensitive Ras-GEFs such as RasGRP (Ras guanyl-releasing protein), which contains a C1 domain (DAG-binding) and EF-hand (Ca2+-binding) motifs. This provides a direct link from PLC signaling to Ras-MAPK activation, explaining how Gq-coupled receptors can stimulate cell proliferation. S4: FALSE — Cross-talk can be either stimulatory or inhibitory. As noted in S2, PKA phosphorylation of Raf is inhibitory. Other examples of inhibitory cross-talk include MAPK phosphorylation of SMAD proteins (inhibiting TGF-beta signaling) and GSK-3 phosphorylation that inhibits multiple pathways.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — An activated GPCR acts catalytically, promoting GDP-to-GTP exchange on multiple Gs or Gi molecules sequentially. The receptor remains active as long as the agonist is bound, and each nucleotide exchange event takes ~1 second, so a single receptor can activate many G proteins during its active lifetime. This is the first amplification step. S2: TRUE — Steady-state cAMP levels reflect the balance between synthesis by adenylyl cyclase (activated by Gs, inhibited by Gi) and degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Both are regulated: adenylyl cyclase by G proteins, calcium, and forskolin; PDEs by cGMP, calcium/calmodulin, and phosphorylation. S3: FALSE — While enzymatic steps provide the greatest amplification, receptor-level events also contribute. For example, cooperative ligand binding can create switch-like responses, and receptor clustering can amplify signaling. Additionally, positive feedback loops at non-enzymatic steps (e.g., receptor-mediated recruitment of additional signaling components) can amplify signals. S4: TRUE — Glycogen phosphorylase kinase has four subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). The delta subunit IS calmodulin, making the enzyme constitutively Ca2+-sensitive. PKA phosphorylates the alpha and beta regulatory subunits. Full activation requires both Ca2+ and PKA phosphorylation, making this a convergence point for cAMP and Ca2+ signaling in glycogen mobilization.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — After signaling, cytoplasmic Ca2+ must be rapidly restored to ~100 nM. SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) pumps Ca2+ back into the ER lumen. PMCA (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase) and NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) extrude Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. These active transport mechanisms use ATP hydrolysis or ion gradients to maintain the 10,000-fold concentration gradient. S2: TRUE — STIM1 is an ER-resident single-pass transmembrane protein with an EF-hand Ca2+-sensing domain in the ER lumen. When ER Ca2+ drops, STIM1 oligomerizes and translocates to ER-plasma membrane junctions, where it directly binds and activates Orai1, a highly Ca2+-selective channel in the plasma membrane. This SOCE mechanism sustains elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ for prolonged signaling. S3: TRUE — Cells often respond with repetitive Ca2+ spikes rather than sustained elevation. Different frequencies activate different downstream targets: low-frequency oscillations preferentially activate NFAT (important for T cell activation), while higher frequencies activate NF-kappaB and other transcription factors. This frequency modulation is analogous to frequency-modulated (FM) radio signals. S4: FALSE — DAG is a hydrophobic lipid (diacylglycerol) that remains embedded in the plasma membrane after PIP2 cleavage. It does NOT diffuse through the aqueous cytoplasm. PKC must translocate FROM the cytoplasm TO the membrane to interact with DAG. IP3 is the water-soluble product that diffuses through the cytoplasm.",

Blocking GRK2 alone sustains cAMP at 48 (vs 12), and blocking beta-arrestin alone sustains it at 42 (vs 12). These similar effects are consistent with GRK2 and beta-arrestin acting in the SAME sequential pathway: GRK2 phosphorylates the receptor, creating binding sites for beta-arrestin. Crucially, blocking BOTH together (cAMP = 65 at 60 min) provides more protection than either alone but does NOT completely prevent desensitization (65 is still below the initial 90). This residual desensitization indicates additional GRK2/beta-arrestin-independent mechanisms (such as PKA-mediated phosphorylation or receptor internalization via alternative pathways). Option A is incorrect because if they were truly independent, blocking both should equal the sum of individual effects. Option C is refuted because GRK2 inhibition alone has a strong effect.

This reduction is consistent across all doses (at 10 ng/mL: 88% vs 10%, ~89% reduction). The small residual pERK in DN-Ras cells (10-14%) likely reflects either incomplete dominant-negative suppression or minor Ras-independent ERK activation pathways (such as through PKC or Src family kinases). Option A is incorrect because the residual signal is minor (~10-14%), not indicative of a primary alternative pathway.

Second, in Ca2+-free medium, only a single transient peak occurs (duration above 200 nM = 35 s vs 180 s), and no oscillations are observed.

Pertussis toxin: Basal cAMP is only slightly elevated (8 vs 5). Isoproterenol increases cAMP normally (50 vs 45 in untreated). The critical observation is that carbachol (an M2 agonist that activates Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase) has NO effect in pertussis toxin-treated cells (48 vs 50, compared to the normal reduction from 45 to 18). This demonstrates that pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates Gi-alpha, locking it in the GDP-bound (inactive) state so it cannot couple to the M2 receptor.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B provides the most definitive evidence through an epistasis approach combined with direct binding data. By expressing constitutively active mutants at each cascade level: (1) RasV12 should still be blocked by Drug Z if the drug disrupts Ras-Raf interaction, because even constitutively active Ras still needs to bind Raf; (2) Raf-CAAX (constitutively active Raf targeted to the membrane independently of Ras) should BYPASS Drug Z, because Raf is already activated without needing Ras; (3) MEK-DD should also bypass Drug Z. This pattern (blocks RasV12 but not Raf-CAAX or MEK-DD) precisely localizes the drug's action between Ras and Raf. The SPR experiment directly demonstrates physical disruption of the Ras-Raf interaction in a cell-free system, ruling out indirect effects. Option A only shows the drug reduces pERK but provides no mechanistic information about where it acts. Option C rules out direct kinase inhibition but doesn't prove the Ras-Raf interaction is targeted. Option D provides supporting evidence but could be an indirect consequence of pathway inhibition at any upstream point.",

      "options": ["Sic1", "Cdh1", "Cdc20", "Skp2"],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cdc20 is the co-activator that associates with APC/C during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. APC/C-Cdc20 specifically recognizes the D-box (destruction box) motif in securin and cyclin B, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Securin destruction releases separase, which cleaves cohesin rings holding sister chromatids together. Cdh1 is a different APC/C co-activator that functions later in mitosis and G1 to maintain low cyclin levels. Skp2 is an F-box protein in the SCF complex, not an APC/C co-activator. Sic1 is a CKI (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) in yeast, not an APC/C activator.",

      "explanation": "Origin licensing requires the sequential action of ORC (Origin Recognition Complex), Cdc6, and Cdt1 to load the MCM2-7 hexameric helicase onto replication origins during G1 phase. ORC first binds the origin, then recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1, which together load MCM2-7 as a double hexamer around double-stranded DNA. This forms the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). Once S phase begins, CDK and DDK activities trigger origin firing but also inactivate the licensing factors \u2014 Cdc6 is phosphorylated and degraded, Cdt1 is inhibited by geminin, and MCM2-7 cannot be re-loaded. Geminin inhibits (not promotes) licensing. CDK2-cyclin E is involved in triggering firing, not loading MCM.",

      "explanation": "Mad1 is constitutively localized to unattached kinetochores and serves as the primary platform for SAC signaling. Mad1 forms a stable complex with a 'closed' conformer of Mad2 (C-Mad2) at unattached kinetochores, which catalyzes the conversion of soluble 'open' Mad2 (O-Mad2) to C-Mad2 through the Mad2 template model. This newly converted C-Mad2 then binds Cdc20, incorporating it into the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) along with BubR1 and Bub3, which inhibits APC/C-Cdc20. BubR1 is a MCC component but not the primary kinetochore sensor. Aurora B is involved in error correction of improper attachments. Mad2 is the effector but Mad1 is the sensor/template.",

When ATM/ATR kinases detect DNA lesions, they phosphorylate and stabilize p53, which then binds to p53 response elements in the p21 promoter. Elevated p21 protein inhibits CDK2-cyclin E and CDK2-cyclin A complexes, preventing Rb phosphorylation and maintaining the G1/S checkpoint. E2F1 is a transcription factor that promotes S phase entry genes, not p21. Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor that drives proliferation.

The contractile ring consists of antiparallel actin filaments and non-muscle myosin II, which slides actin filaments past each other to generate the constrictive force. RhoA GTPase, activated by the centralspindlin complex at the cell equator, promotes both actin filament assembly (via formins like mDia) and myosin II activation (via ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain). Kinesin-5 generates forces in the mitotic spindle midzone. Cytoplasmic dynein functions at kinetochores and cell cortex. Kinesin-13 depolymerizes microtubules at kinetochores.",

HDAC removes acetyl groups from histone tails, creating a condensed chromatin state that represses transcription. When CDK4/6-cyclin D and then CDK2-cyclin E sequentially phosphorylate Rb, the phosphorylated Rb releases from E2F, allowing E2F to activate S-phase genes.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In vertebrates, cohesin removal occurs in two phases. During prophase, the 'prophase pathway' removes arm cohesins through a non-proteolytic mechanism: Plk1 and Aurora B kinases phosphorylate the cohesin subunit SA2 (Scc3), which promotes the anti-establishment factor Wapl to open the cohesin ring and release it from chromosome arms. Centromeric cohesins are protected from this pathway by Shugoshin (Sgo1), which recruits PP2A phosphatase to counteract the phosphorylation. At anaphase onset, separase (activated by APC/C-Cdc20-mediated securin destruction) cleaves the remaining centromeric cohesin subunit Scc1/Rad21.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Restriction Point corresponds to the molecular switch created by Rb hyperphosphorylation. Initially, mitogenic signaling through Ras-MAPK-ERK induces cyclin D expression, and CDK4/6-cyclin D mono-phosphorylates Rb. This partial phosphorylation releases enough E2F to begin transcribing cyclin E. CDK2-cyclin E then hyperphosphorylates Rb in a positive feedback loop, releasing more E2F, which further amplifies cyclin E expression. This bistable switch makes the transition irreversible \u2014 once CDK2-cyclin E exceeds the threshold, cells are committed to S phase entry regardless of continued mitogenic signaling. MCM loading occurs in G1 but precedes the R point. APC/C-Cdh1 is active before, not after, the R point. CDK1-cyclin B activation occurs much later at G2/M.",

      "explanation": "The augmin complex (also called HAUS complex in humans) is an eight-subunit complex that recruits the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC) to the lateral surface of existing spindle microtubules, nucleating new microtubules that branch from pre-existing ones. This 'microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation' amplifies spindle microtubule density and is essential for robust spindle assembly. The branching microtubules inherit the polarity of the parent microtubule, ensuring proper spindle organization. PRC1/Ase1 crosslinks antiparallel midzone microtubules.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 are the effector kinases that directly target cell cycle regulators. Specifically, Chk1 (and to a lesser extent Chk2) phosphorylates the Cdc25C phosphatase on Ser216, creating a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins that sequester Cdc25C in the cytoplasm. Since Cdc25C is required to remove the inhibitory Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation on CDK1 (placed by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases), its inactivation keeps CDK1-cyclin B in the inactive state, preventing mitotic entry. ATM is the upstream sensor kinase that activates Chk1/Chk2 but does not directly target Cdc25C in most contexts. Wee1 adds the inhibitory phosphate to CDK1 directly, not to Cdc25C.",

Using the relationship: Duration of S phase = (fraction in S phase) x (total cell cycle time) = 0.35 x 22 hours = 7.7 hours. This method, based on the fraction-labeled mitoses (FLM) principle, assumes the population is in steady-state exponential growth with cells uniformly distributed across the cell cycle.

      "explanation": "The flow cytometry data shows that CDK1 inhibition by RO-3306 causes accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content (90%), indicating cells have completed DNA replication (passing through S phase) but cannot enter mitosis. Since CDK1-cyclin B activation is the trigger for mitotic entry, inhibiting CDK1 blocks cells at the G2/M boundary where they have fully replicated 4N DNA content but cannot undergo chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, or spindle assembly. The small remaining fraction at 2N likely represents cells that were in G1 at the time of drug addition and have not yet progressed through S phase.

After 24 hours of drug treatment, the accumulation pattern clearly distinguishes these two arrest points.

Counting mitotic figures could detect a mitotic block but cannot reliably distinguish G1/S from other arrest points, and cells at G2/M may not yet be in mitosis.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Centrosome duplication is tightly coupled to the cell cycle through a 'licensing' mechanism analogous to DNA replication licensing. In late mitosis/G1, the two centrioles within each centrosome disengage (lose their orthogonal arrangement), which is the 'licensing' step \u2014 equivalent to pre-RC formation at replication origins. This disengagement requires separase and Plk1 activity. In S phase, CDK2-cyclin E/A activity triggers centriole duplication by phosphorylating key substrates including nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), which dissociates from centrosomes and allows procentriole assembly. Each mother centriole templates exactly one daughter. The engagement of the new centriole pair prevents reduplication until the next mitotic disengagement event. Centrosomes persist across cell cycles; they are not degraded. p53 loss can lead to centrosome amplification but not through direct inhibition of duplication.",

Aurora B is positioned at the inner centromere, where it phosphorylates outer kinetochore substrates (Ndc80/Hec1, KNL1) when kinetochore-microtubule attachments lack tension. Syntelic attachments (both sister kinetochores attached to the same pole) and merotelic attachments (one kinetochore attached to both poles) do not generate proper tension, keeping Aurora B substrates within its phosphorylation range. Phosphorylation of Ndc80 reduces its microtubule-binding affinity, destabilizing the incorrect attachment and allowing re-attachment.

Conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3' end of linear chromosomes, resulting in loss of approximately 50-200 base pairs of telomeric DNA per cell division. When telomeres shorten below a critical length (~4-6 kb in humans), they lose their protective shelterin cap and are recognized as DNA double-strand breaks, activating the ATM/ATR-p53-p21 pathway and triggering replicative senescence. Most somatic cells lack sufficient telomerase activity to maintain telomere length. Cells that bypass senescence checkpoints (via p53/Rb loss) eventually reach crisis, where critically short telomeres cause end-to-end fusions and genomic instability.

This creates a bistable switch: once CDK1 activity crosses a threshold, the positive feedback rapidly drives full activation \u2014 Cdc25 becomes fully active and Wee1 becomes fully inhibited, ensuring rapid and complete CDK1 activation.

The other three options are well-established mechanisms: (1) Merotelic attachments, where a single kinetochore is attached to microtubules from both poles, can lead to lagging chromosomes in anaphase if not corrected by Aurora B, resulting in chromosome missegregation. (2) A weakened SAC, through reduced expression of Mad2 or other checkpoint components, allows cells to enter anaphase despite incorrect attachments. (3) Centrosome amplification (supernumerary centrosomes) creates multipolar spindles that, even if clustered into pseudo-bipolar configurations, increase the frequency of merotelic attachments.

However, G2 nuclei have already fired all their origins during the preceding S phase, and the licensing factors have been inactivated: Cdc6 has been phosphorylated and degraded, Cdt1 is inhibited by geminin, and MCM helicases have been displaced from origins during replication fork passage.

APC normally targets beta-catenin for destruction; its loss leads to constitutive Wnt signaling and hyperproliferation. (2) KRAS activation (12p12) promotes growth of the adenoma \u2014 activating mutations (typically G12V or G12D) lock Ras in the GTP-bound active state, constitutively activating the MAPK pathway. (3) SMAD4 loss (18q21) disrupts TGF-beta signaling, removing growth inhibition and promoting progression to late adenoma. (4) p53 loss (17p13) removes the final barrier to malignant transformation, allowing accumulation of genomic instability and invasion. This ordered model, based on analysis of tumors at different stages, demonstrates that cancer requires multiple hits.",

The TERC RNA contains a short sequence complementary to the telomeric repeat (5'-AAUCCC-3' in humans, templating the 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeat). TERT binds the 3' overhang of the telomere, aligns it with the RNA template, and extends the G-rich strand by reverse transcription. After adding one repeat unit, telomerase translocates and re-aligns for another round. The complementary C-rich strand is then filled in by conventional DNA polymerase alpha-primase.

When cells form dense confluent monolayers, E-cadherin-based adherens junctions activate the Hippo pathway kinase cascade: MST1/2 (Hippo homolog) phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2, which phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ on multiple serine residues. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins and targeted for proteasomal degradation. This prevents YAP/TAZ from entering the nucleus and co-activating TEAD transcription factors, which drive expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes. NF2/Merlin (an upstream Hippo activator) is also activated by cell-cell contact.

The CCAN then recruits the outer kinetochore KMN network (KNL1-MIS12-NDC80 complexes), where the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80/Hec1-Nuf2-Spc24-Spc25) provides the primary microtubule-binding interface through the CH domains of Ndc80 and Nuf2.

The timing of abscission is regulated by an Aurora B-dependent 'NoCut' checkpoint (abscission checkpoint) that delays abscission if chromatin bridges are trapped in the intercellular canal. Aurora B kinase, relocated to the midbody ring, phosphorylates CHMP4C (an ESCRT-III component), preventing premature ESCRT-III polymerization and membrane scission. When the checkpoint is satisfied (no trapped chromatin), Aurora B activity at the midbody decreases, CHMP4C is dephosphorylated, and ESCRT-III filaments (primarily CHMP4B) polymerize into helical filaments that constrict the membrane. The AAA-ATPase VPS4 then remodels ESCRT-III to complete scission. Spastin does sever midbody microtubules but is downstream of ESCRT-III recruitment.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Oncogene-induced senescence occurs because hyperactive mitogenic signaling (from oncogenic Ras, BRAF V600E, or cyclin E overexpression) paradoxically triggers DNA replication stress. Excessive replication origin firing, fork stalling, and re-replication lead to DNA damage (DSBs), activating the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 DNA damage response pathways. This stabilizes p53 (via Chk2 phosphorylation and MDM2 inhibition by p14ARF, which is upregulated by oncogenic signaling) and upregulates p16INK4a (through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling). The combined action of p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways enforces irreversible cell cycle arrest. OIS is a major tumor-suppressive barrier that must be overcome (by p53/Rb loss) for oncogene-driven tumors to develop.

At mitotic onset, Cdc25 phosphatases (primarily Cdc25B for initial activation and Cdc25C for amplification) remove these inhibitory phosphates, converting CDK1 to its active form.

      "explanation": "The Warburg effect, first observed by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, describes the phenomenon where cancer cells preferentially convert glucose to lactate through glycolysis even when sufficient oxygen is available for oxidative phosphorylation (hence 'aerobic glycolysis'). Although glycolysis produces far less ATP per glucose molecule (2 ATP vs. ~30-36 ATP from complete oxidation), cancer cells compensate by dramatically upregulating glucose uptake (via GLUT1 transporter overexpression) and glycolytic flux. The Warburg effect provides rapidly dividing cells with biosynthetic precursors (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) from glycolytic intermediates, which is more important for proliferation than maximal ATP production. This metabolic shift is driven by oncogene activation (Ras, Myc, Akt) and HIF-1alpha stabilization, which upregulate glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters.

In Drosophila, larval salivary gland cells undergo many rounds of endoreduplication (up to 1024N) to produce giant polytene chromosomes that support massive gene expression for salivary proteins. In mammals, hepatocytes commonly become tetraploid or octaploid through endoreduplication or failed cytokinesis, and megakaryocytes undergo endomitosis to reach 64-128N before platelet fragmentation. In plants, endoreduplication is extremely common \u2014 trichome cells, endosperm cells, and many differentiated cell types use endoreduplication to increase cell size without division. The molecular mechanism involves oscillation of CDK2-cyclin E/A activity without CDK1-cyclin B activation, allowing S-phase re-entry without mitosis. APC/C-Cdh1 remains active to degrade mitotic cyclins while allowing S-phase cyclins to accumulate periodically.",

At 4 Gy, 15% survive. At 6 Gy, 3% survive. At 8 Gy, 0.5% survive. When the same experiment is performed on cells with a mutant ATM kinase, survival at 2 Gy drops to 10% and continues to decline steeply. What do these results indicate about ATM function?",

      "explanation": "The clonogenic assay data show that ATM-mutant cells are significantly more radiosensitive than wild-type cells \u2014 at 2 Gy, only 10% of ATM-mutant cells survive versus 50% of wild-type. This increased radiosensitivity demonstrates that ATM is critical for the cellular response to ionizing radiation. ATM is the primary kinase that responds to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs): it is activated by the MRN complex at DSB sites and phosphorylates numerous substrates including H2AX (gamma-H2AX for damage signaling), Chk2 (for checkpoint activation), p53 (for transcriptional response), BRCA1 (for homologous recombination repair), and 53BP1. Without functional ATM, cells cannot properly arrest the cell cycle to allow repair, and DSB repair efficiency is compromised. This is why patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM mutations) are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation.",

During early mitosis (prometaphase and metaphase), the CPC localizes to the inner centromere, where Aurora B functions in error correction of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and contributes to SAC signaling. The inner centromere targeting is mediated by haspin kinase (phosphorylates H3-Thr3) and Bub1 kinase (phosphorylates H2A-Thr120), which recruit survivin and borealin respectively. During the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, the CPC relocates to the central spindle (midzone) through MKLP2-dependent transport along antiparallel microtubules, guided by the interaction of INCENP with microtubules.

This creates a 'search' behavior where growing microtubule plus-ends explore the cytoplasm. When a dynamic microtubule encounters a kinetochore, it is 'captured' \u2014 stabilized against catastrophe by kinetochore-associated proteins (Ndc80 complex, CENP-E motor). The RanGTP gradient around chromosomes does contribute by locally promoting microtubule nucleation and stabilization, supplementing (but not replacing) the search-and-capture mechanism.

This docking interaction tethers the substrate near the CDK active site, dramatically increasing the effective local concentration and allowing efficient phosphorylation even at low CDK activity. This explains substrate ordering during the cell cycle: substrates with strong RXL motifs (like p27, which is a CDK2-cyclin E substrate for its own destruction) are phosphorylated early when CDK levels are still rising, while substrates lacking RXL motifs require higher CDK activity and are phosphorylated later.

RPA-ssDNA recruits the ATR-ATRIP kinase complex, which is then activated by TopBP1 (recruited via the 9-1-1 complex loaded at primer-template junctions by the Rad17-RFC complex). Activated ATR phosphorylates Chk1, which inhibits Cdc25 phosphatases and prevents CDK1-cyclin B activation, ensuring that cells do not enter mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA. This checkpoint is particularly important when replication forks stall (due to nucleotide depletion, DNA damage, or difficult-to-replicate sequences), as stalled forks accumulate more ssDNA and generate stronger ATR signaling. The checkpoint also stabilizes stalled forks through Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of fork-associated proteins, preventing fork collapse into double-strand breaks.",

This is the opposite mechanism to vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine) and colchicine, which prevent microtubule polymerization. Stabilized microtubules cannot undergo the dynamic instability (cycles of growth and shrinkage) essential for spindle function: kinetochore-microtubule attachment, error correction, chromosome congression, and anaphase chromosome movement all require microtubule dynamics. Taxol-treated cells arrest in mitosis with the SAC activated because stable microtubules make abnormal attachments that cannot be corrected.

      "explanation": "Oncogene addiction describes the paradoxical dependence of cancer cells on the continued activity of a single dominant oncogene, even though tumors harbor numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. When the driving oncogene is acutely inhibited, the cancer cell undergoes apoptosis, senescence, or differentiation because the remaining oncogenic signals cannot compensate. This concept explains the remarkable clinical efficacy of targeted therapies: imatinib against BCR-ABL in CML, trastuzumab against HER2 in breast cancer, vemurafenib against BRAF V600E in melanoma, and gefitinib/erlotinib against mutant EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma. The molecular basis involves 'oncogenic shock' \u2014 acute oncogene inhibition leads to differential decay rates of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals, transiently tipping the balance toward death. Resistance emerges through bypass pathway activation or target mutation.",

This is the dominant mechanism in most animal cells. (2) The astral stimulation model proposes that overlapping plus-ends of astral microtubules from opposite poles create a zone of RhoA activation at the equatorial cortex, while astral microtubules closer to the poles deliver inhibitory signals (astral relaxation). In large cells like C. elegans embryos, astral signals are important because the central spindle is far from the cortex. In smaller mammalian cells, the central spindle is the primary determinant. Both models converge on RhoA activation: active RhoA recruits formins (mDia) for actin polymerization and ROCK for myosin II activation to assemble the contractile ring.",

After radiation (which causes DNA double-strand breaks), p53 is stabilized by ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 signaling and activates p21 (for cell cycle arrest) and pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, PUMA, NOXA for apoptosis). p53-null cells lack this response and continue proliferating despite DNA damage, leading to higher survival in the colony formation assay (0.5 vs. 0.2). However, nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest operates through the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which signals through Mad1-Mad2-BubR1-Bub3-Cdc20 to inhibit APC/C \u2014 a pathway completely independent of p53. Since the SAC is intact in both cell lines, both respond identically to nocodazole.

They observe that while 95% of cells in a normal population complete mitosis within 30-45 minutes (from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase onset), 5% of cells show a prolonged prometaphase lasting 2-4 hours before eventually completing division.

      "explanation": "These observations elegantly demonstrate the SAC's role as a quality control mechanism. The 5% of cells with prolonged prometaphase represent cells that had initial kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (syntelic, monotelic, or merotelic). The SAC detected unattached or tensionless kinetochores and delayed anaphase onset by inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20, giving the Aurora B error correction machinery time to destabilize incorrect attachments and allow proper re-attachment. Eventually these cells achieve full bipolar attachment and satisfy the SAC. When Mad2 is partially depleted, the SAC cannot sustain the wait signal \u2014 cells proceed to anaphase regardless of attachment status. This eliminates the delay but allows cells with incorrect attachments to segregate chromosomes erroneously, producing aneuploid daughter cells.

The key finding is that TERT-expressing cells maintain normal karyotype, contact inhibition, growth factor dependence, and checkpoint function \u2014 they are NOT transformed. They simply do not undergo replicative senescence because their telomeres remain above the critical length threshold. This proves that telomere shortening is the 'counting mechanism' for the Hayflick limit. TERT does not inactivate p53 or Rb; instead, it prevents the upstream signal (short telomeres being recognized as DNA damage) that would activate these pathways.

(2) SA-beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 is a widely used senescence marker \u2014 senescent cells stain positive (blue) while quiescent or proliferating cells do not. (3) p16 protein levels distinguish the two types of arrest: senescent cells typically have high p16 (which creates an irreversible Rb-mediated block), while quiescent cells rely more on p27.

If these tetraploid cells re-enter the cell cycle, they replicate their DNA to 8N in S phase, and can divide as pseudo-diploid cells with double the normal chromosome complement. Alternatively, endoreduplication (S-phase re-entry without mitosis) can produce polyploid cells. Common causes include disrupted RhoA signaling, mutations in cytokinesis regulators, or tetraploidization from prolonged mitotic arrest followed by 'mitotic slippage.'

This triggers p27 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, further increasing CDK2 activity, which degrades more p27. The non-phosphorylatable p27-T187A mutant cannot be recognized by SCF-Skp2, so it accumulates and permanently inhibits CDK2, preventing S-phase entry.

Leptomycin B blocks CRM1, preventing nuclear export and causing cyclin B1 to accumulate in the nucleus. Nuclear CDK1-cyclin B1 gains access to its nuclear substrates (lamins, condensins, etc.) prematurely, promoting mitotic entry. Normally, at the G2/M transition, CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin B1's cytoplasmic retention signal (CRS) blocks its nuclear export and enhances import, creating a rapid nuclear accumulation that triggers full mitotic entry.

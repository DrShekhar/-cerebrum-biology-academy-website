      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cdc20 is the co-activator that associates with APC/C during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. APC/C-Cdc20 specifically recognizes the D-box (destruction box) motif in securin and cyclin B, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Securin destruction releases separase, which cleaves cohesin rings holding sister chromatids together. Cdh1 is a different APC/C co-activator that functions later in mitosis and G1 to maintain low cyclin levels. Skp2 is an F-box protein in the SCF complex, not an APC/C co-activator. Sic1 is a CKI (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) in yeast, not an APC/C activator.",

      "explanation": "Origin licensing requires the sequential action of ORC (Origin Recognition Complex), Cdc6, and Cdt1 to load the MCM2-7 hexameric helicase onto replication origins during G1 phase. ORC first binds the origin, then recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1, which together load MCM2-7 as a double hexamer around double-stranded DNA. This forms the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). Once S phase begins, CDK and DDK activities trigger origin firing but also inactivate the licensing factors \u2014 Cdc6 is phosphorylated and degraded, Cdt1 is inhibited by geminin, and MCM2-7 cannot be re-loaded. Geminin inhibits (not promotes) licensing. CDK2-cyclin E is involved in triggering firing, not loading MCM.",

Mad1 forms a stable complex with a 'closed' conformer of Mad2 (C-Mad2) at unattached kinetochores, which catalyzes the conversion of soluble 'open' Mad2 (O-Mad2) to C-Mad2 through the Mad2 template model. This newly converted C-Mad2 then binds Cdc20, incorporating it into the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) along with BubR1 and Bub3, which inhibits APC/C-Cdc20.

Elevated p21 protein inhibits CDK2-cyclin E and CDK2-cyclin A complexes, preventing Rb phosphorylation and maintaining the G1/S checkpoint.

The contractile ring consists of antiparallel actin filaments and non-muscle myosin II, which slides actin filaments past each other to generate the constrictive force. RhoA GTPase, activated by the centralspindlin complex at the cell equator, promotes both actin filament assembly (via formins like mDia) and myosin II activation (via ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain).

HDAC removes acetyl groups from histone tails, creating a condensed chromatin state that represses transcription. When CDK4/6-cyclin D and then CDK2-cyclin E sequentially phosphorylate Rb, the phosphorylated Rb releases from E2F, allowing E2F to activate S-phase genes.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In vertebrates, cohesin removal occurs in two phases. During prophase, the 'prophase pathway' removes arm cohesins through a non-proteolytic mechanism: Plk1 and Aurora B kinases phosphorylate the cohesin subunit SA2 (Scc3), which promotes the anti-establishment factor Wapl to open the cohesin ring and release it from chromosome arms. Centromeric cohesins are protected from this pathway by Shugoshin (Sgo1), which recruits PP2A phosphatase to counteract the phosphorylation. At anaphase onset, separase (activated by APC/C-Cdc20-mediated securin destruction) cleaves the remaining centromeric cohesin subunit Scc1/Rad21.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Restriction Point corresponds to the molecular switch created by Rb hyperphosphorylation. Initially, mitogenic signaling through Ras-MAPK-ERK induces cyclin D expression, and CDK4/6-cyclin D mono-phosphorylates Rb. This partial phosphorylation releases enough E2F to begin transcribing cyclin E. CDK2-cyclin E then hyperphosphorylates Rb in a positive feedback loop, releasing more E2F, which further amplifies cyclin E expression. This bistable switch makes the transition irreversible \u2014 once CDK2-cyclin E exceeds the threshold, cells are committed to S phase entry regardless of continued mitogenic signaling. MCM loading occurs in G1 but precedes the R point. APC/C-Cdh1 is active before, not after, the R point. CDK1-cyclin B activation occurs much later at G2/M.",

This 'microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation' amplifies spindle microtubule density and is essential for robust spindle assembly. The branching microtubules inherit the polarity of the parent microtubule, ensuring proper spindle organization. PRC1/Ase1 crosslinks antiparallel midzone microtubules.

Specifically, Chk1 (and to a lesser extent Chk2) phosphorylates the Cdc25C phosphatase on Ser216, creating a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins that sequester Cdc25C in the cytoplasm. Since Cdc25C is required to remove the inhibitory Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation on CDK1 (placed by Wee1 and Myt1 kinases), its inactivation keeps CDK1-cyclin B in the inactive state, preventing mitotic entry. ATM is the upstream sensor kinase that activates Chk1/Chk2 but does not directly target Cdc25C in most contexts. Wee1 adds the inhibitory phosphate to CDK1 directly, not to Cdc25C.",

The statement that condensin I creates lateral loops and condensin II compacts axially is the reverse of the actual mechanism.",

For example, cdc28 (CDK1/Cdc28) mutants arrested as unbudded cells in G1, while cdc2 mutants arrested with large buds. The uniform arrest morphology indicated that these genes were required at specific cell cycle transitions. This approach predated CRISPR, RNAi, and GFP technology by decades.

This disengagement requires separase and Plk1 activity. In S phase, CDK2-cyclin E/A activity triggers centriole duplication by phosphorylating key substrates including nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), which dissociates from centrosomes and allows procentriole assembly. Each mother centriole templates exactly one daughter. The engagement of the new centriole pair prevents reduplication until the next mitotic disengagement event.

Conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3' end of linear chromosomes, resulting in loss of approximately 50-200 base pairs of telomeric DNA per cell division. When telomeres shorten below a critical length (~4-6 kb in humans), they lose their protective shelterin cap and are recognized as DNA double-strand breaks, activating the ATM/ATR-p53-p21 pathway and triggering replicative senescence. Most somatic cells lack sufficient telomerase activity to maintain telomere length. Cells that bypass senescence checkpoints (via p53/Rb loss) eventually reach crisis, where critically short telomeres cause end-to-end fusions and genomic instability.

This creates a bistable switch: once CDK1 activity crosses a threshold, the positive feedback rapidly drives full activation \u2014 Cdc25 becomes fully active and Wee1 becomes fully inhibited, ensuring rapid and complete CDK1 activation.

Cells with non-degradable cyclin B1 can initiate anaphase (since securin still has a D-box and can be degraded by APC/C-Cdc20), but they arrest in late mitosis with separated but condensed chromosomes and no nuclear envelope reformation.",

By blocking CDK4/6-cyclin D, p16 prevents Rb phosphorylation, maintaining Rb in its active hypophosphorylated state that represses E2F target genes. The CDKN2A locus is one of the most frequently mutated or silenced (by promoter methylation) loci in human cancer.

Phospho-ENSA/ARPP-19 bind to PP2A-B55 as potent competitive inhibitors, blocking its phosphatase activity toward CDK substrates.

The PBD of Plk1 recognizes motifs containing phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (typically S-pS/pT-P), which are often created by prior CDK phosphorylation ('priming phosphorylation'). This creates a sequential phosphorylation relay: CDK1 first phosphorylates a substrate, creating a docking site for Plk1's PBD, which then allows Plk1 to phosphorylate nearby sites. The PBD also has an autoinhibitory function \u2014 in the inactive state, PBD binds to the kinase domain and inhibits it. When PBD engages a phosphopeptide on a substrate, it releases the kinase domain, activating Plk1. This elegant mechanism ensures both spatial targeting and kinase activation at the site of action.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Oncogene-induced senescence occurs because hyperactive mitogenic signaling (from oncogenic Ras, BRAF V600E, or cyclin E overexpression) paradoxically triggers DNA replication stress. Excessive replication origin firing, fork stalling, and re-replication lead to DNA damage (DSBs), activating the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 DNA damage response pathways. This stabilizes p53 (via Chk2 phosphorylation and MDM2 inhibition by p14ARF, which is upregulated by oncogenic signaling) and upregulates p16INK4a (through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling). The combined action of p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways enforces irreversible cell cycle arrest. OIS is a major tumor-suppressive barrier that must be overcome (by p53/Rb loss) for oncogene-driven tumors to develop. OIS cells display typical senescence markers including SAHF, SASP, and SA-beta-gal activity.",

At mitotic onset, Cdc25 phosphatases (primarily Cdc25B for initial activation and Cdc25C for amplification) remove these inhibitory phosphates, converting CDK1 to its active form.

Although glycolysis produces far less ATP per glucose molecule (2 ATP vs. ~30-36 ATP from complete oxidation), cancer cells compensate by dramatically upregulating glucose uptake (via GLUT1 transporter overexpression) and glycolytic flux. The Warburg effect provides rapidly dividing cells with biosynthetic precursors (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) from glycolytic intermediates, which is more important for proliferation than maximal ATP production. This metabolic shift is driven by oncogene activation (Ras, Myc, Akt) and HIF-1alpha stabilization, which upregulate glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters.

In plants, endoreduplication is extremely common \u2014 trichome cells, endosperm cells, and many differentiated cell types use endoreduplication to increase cell size without division.

      "options": [
        "The receptor cleaves the ligand into active fragments",
        "The receptor directly phosphorylates downstream target proteins",
        "The receptor undergoes a conformational change that activates the associated heterotrimeric G protein by promoting GDP-to-GTP exchange on the Galpha subunit",
        "The receptor is immediately internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "GPCRs are seven-transmembrane domain receptors that transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G proteins (Galpha-Gbeta-Ggamma). In the inactive state, Galpha binds GDP and associates with Gbeta-Ggamma. When a ligand (hormone, neurotransmitter) binds the extracellular domain, the GPCR undergoes a conformational change in its transmembrane helices (particularly TM3, TM5, TM6) that is transmitted to the cytoplasmic face. This conformational change enables the receptor to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF): it opens the nucleotide-binding pocket of Galpha, promoting GDP release and GTP binding. GTP-bound Galpha dissociates from Gbeta-Ggamma, and both the Galpha-GTP and free Gbeta-Ggamma can activate distinct downstream effectors (adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, ion channels). The signal is terminated when Galpha's intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP back to GDP, facilitated by RGS (regulators of G-protein signaling) proteins.",

      "options": [
        "RTKs are always dimeric; ligand binding causes dissociation, and monomers are the active form",

        "Ligand binding induces or stabilizes receptor dimerization, bringing the cytoplasmic kinase domains into proximity for trans-autophosphorylation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and insulin receptor are activated through ligand-induced dimerization. In the case of most RTKs, binding of a dimeric or bivalent ligand (e.g., PDGF is a disulfide-linked dimer) bridges two receptor monomers. For EGFR, ligand binding to a single monomer causes a conformational change that exposes a dimerization arm, promoting receptor-mediated dimerization. Once dimerized, the intracellular kinase domains of the two receptors are brought into close proximity and undergo trans-autophosphorylation — each kinase phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the other receptor's cytoplasmic tail. These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for SH2 (Src homology 2) and PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain-containing signaling proteins (Grb2, Shc, PLCgamma, PI3K), initiating downstream signaling cascades including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and PLCgamma pathways.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "When GPCRs coupled to Gq activate phospholipase C-beta (PLCbeta), or when RTKs activate PLCgamma, PIP2 (a minor phospholipid in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane) is hydrolyzed into two second messengers. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is water-soluble and diffuses through the cytoplasm to bind IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IP3Rs are ligand-gated Ca2+ channels; IP3 binding opens them, releasing stored Ca2+ from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm, raising cytosolic [Ca2+] from ~100 nM to ~1 µM. Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the plasma membrane and, together with the elevated Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine, activates conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. PKC then phosphorylates numerous substrate proteins on serine/threonine residues, regulating cell growth, differentiation, and gene expression. This bifurcating pathway amplifies the original signal enormously.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade is a three-tiered kinase module that amplifies and transmits signals from RTKs to the nucleus. Ras-GTP (activated by the GEF SOS, recruited via the adaptor Grb2) binds and recruits Raf (a serine/threonine kinase, also called MAPKKK or MAP kinase kinase kinase) to the plasma membrane. Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2 (MAPKK, a dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine). MEK1/2 phosphorylates ERK1/2 (MAPK) on Thr and Tyr within the activation loop (TEY motif). Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates transcription factors (Elk-1, c-Fos, c-Myc) that drive expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The cascade provides signal amplification (~1000-fold at each step) and allows multiple levels of regulation. Oncogenic mutations in Ras (G12V, Q61L) or B-Raf (V600E) constitutively activate this pathway in many cancers.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Scaffold proteins are non-catalytic proteins that bind multiple components of a signaling cascade simultaneously, creating a signaling complex. In MAPK signaling, scaffolds like KSR1 (kinase suppressor of Ras) in mammals and Ste5 in yeast physically organize the three-tiered kinase module. KSR1 binds Raf, MEK, and ERK, keeping them in close proximity. This has several advantages: (1) it increases the efficiency and speed of signal transmission by reducing the dimensionality of the reaction (3D diffusion to 1D proximity); (2) it ensures signaling specificity — cells have multiple parallel MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, p38) using structurally similar kinases, and scaffolds prevent inappropriate cross-activation between pathways; (3) it provides spatial regulation by localizing the signaling complex to specific subcellular locations. Scaffold proteins themselves can be regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or protein-protein interactions, adding another layer of signal control.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cholera toxin (produced by Vibrio cholerae) is an AB5 toxin that enters intestinal epithelial cells and catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs-alpha. Specifically, the A1 subunit of cholera toxin transfers an ADP-ribose group from NAD+ to Arg201 of Gs-alpha. This arginine residue is critical for the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gs-alpha — it stabilizes the transition state for GTP hydrolysis. ADP-ribosylation of Arg201 abolishes GTPase activity, permanently locking Gs-alpha in the active GTP-bound conformation. Constitutively active Gs-alpha continuously stimulates adenylyl cyclase, producing excessive cAMP. In intestinal epithelial cells, elevated cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates and opens CFTR chloride channels, causing massive Cl- and water secretion into the intestinal lumen — producing the profuse watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera. Pertussis toxin similarly ADP-ribosylates Gi-alpha (at a cysteine), preventing its activation and blocking the inhibitory pathway.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cell signaling can be classified by the distance between signaling and target cells. Paracrine signaling involves the release of local mediators (growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters) that diffuse through the extracellular fluid to act on neighboring cells within a short range (typically micrometers to millimeters). Examples include growth factor signaling during development, neurotransmission at synapses (which is a specialized form of paracrine signaling), and inflammatory cytokine release. The signal is typically short-lived due to local degradation, uptake, or binding to extracellular matrix. Endocrine signaling involves hormone release into the bloodstream, allowing signals to travel long distances (centimeters to meters) to reach target cells throughout the body. Examples include insulin from pancreatic beta cells, thyroxine from the thyroid, and cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Direct cell-cell contact signaling (juxtacrine) is a separate category involving membrane-bound ligands (Delta-Notch, ephrins-Eph receptors).",

        "PI3K dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2, activating Akt by releasing it from membrane sequestration",
        "PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to produce PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which recruits Akt to the plasma membrane via its PH domain, where Akt is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and mTORC2",

        "PI3K produces ceramide, which directly binds and activates Akt in the cytoplasm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by RTKs or GPCRs and phosphorylates the 3' position of the inositol ring of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate). PIP3 is a membrane-anchored lipid second messenger that recruits proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to the plasma membrane. Akt (also called PKB, protein kinase B) has a PH domain that binds PIP3, bringing Akt to the membrane. At the membrane, Akt is activated by dual phosphorylation: PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, also PH domain-containing and membrane-recruited by PIP3) phosphorylates Akt at Thr308 in the activation loop, and mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2) phosphorylates Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif. Fully activated Akt phosphorylates numerous substrates promoting cell survival (Bad, FOXO), growth (TSC2/mTOR), and metabolism (GSK3). The pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase, which dephosphorylates PIP3 back to PIP2. PTEN loss is one of the most common events in human cancer.",

        "Ca2+ spontaneously crystallizes at low concentrations, removing it from solution"

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Maintaining the steep Ca2+ concentration gradient (~10,000-fold across the plasma membrane and ~1,000-fold across the ER membrane) requires constant active transport. Three main systems collaborate: (1) PMCA (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase): a P-type ATPase that pumps Ca2+ out of the cell using ATP hydrolysis (high affinity, low capacity). (2) NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger): a secondary active transporter that exports 1 Ca2+ in exchange for 3 Na+ flowing down the Na+ gradient (lower affinity but higher capacity, particularly important in excitable cells). (3) SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase): a P-type ATPase that pumps Ca2+ from the cytoplasm into the ER/SR lumen (2 Ca2+ per ATP). Together, these transporters maintain cytosolic [Ca2+] at ~100 nM. The low resting [Ca2+] is critical because it allows small Ca2+ influxes (through IP3Rs, voltage-gated channels, store-operated channels) to create large relative concentration changes, producing a strong signal.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Notch signaling uses a remarkable mechanism called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Notch is a single-pass transmembrane receptor that undergoes S1 cleavage by furin during maturation. At the cell surface, binding of Delta or Jagged ligands on an adjacent cell (requiring direct cell-cell contact) generates a mechanical pulling force that exposes the S2 cleavage site in the Notch extracellular domain near the membrane. ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) or TACE cleaves at S2, removing most of the extracellular domain. This exposes the S3 site within the transmembrane domain to gamma-secretase (the same presenilin-containing complex that cleaves APP in Alzheimer's disease). Gamma-secretase cleaves within the membrane, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CSL (CBF1/RBPjkappa), displacing co-repressors and recruiting co-activators (Mastermind/MAML), activating target genes (HES, HEY family). Notch signaling is critical for cell fate decisions, lateral inhibition, and boundary formation during development.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Steroid hormones (cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, aldosterone, progesterone) are derived from cholesterol and retain its hydrophobic four-ring steroid nucleus. Their small size (~300 Da) and lipophilicity allow them to partition into and diffuse across the phospholipid bilayer without requiring any transporter or channel. Once inside the cell, steroids bind intracellular receptors — either cytoplasmic (glucocorticoid receptor, GR; mineralocorticoid receptor, MR) or nuclear (estrogen receptor, ER; progesterone receptor, PR). The hormone-receptor complex undergoes conformational change, dimerizes, and binds specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs) in gene promoters, directly regulating transcription. This mechanism produces slower responses (hours) compared to cell-surface receptor signaling (seconds to minutes) because it requires new mRNA and protein synthesis. Peptide hormones (insulin, glucagon, growth hormone) are too large and hydrophilic to cross the membrane and must bind cell-surface receptors.",

      "explanation": "Calmodulin is a small (17 kDa), highly conserved protein with four EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs (two in each lobe, connected by a flexible linker). When cytosolic Ca2+ rises (from ~100 nM to ~1 µM during signaling), four Ca2+ ions bind cooperatively to calmodulin, causing dramatic conformational changes. Ca2+-bound calmodulin adopts an open, dumbbell-shaped structure that exposes methionine-rich hydrophobic patches on each lobe. These hydrophobic surfaces wrap around amphipathic alpha-helical domains on target proteins, activating them. Key targets include: CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) — crucial for learning and memory; calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) — activates NFAT transcription factor in T-cell activation, target of immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and cyclosporine; MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) — triggers smooth muscle contraction; adenylyl cyclase (types I and VIII) — links Ca2+ to cAMP production; and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, nNOS).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Signal amplification is a fundamental property of enzymatic signaling cascades, where each activated enzyme produces many product molecules. In the cAMP pathway: (1) One ligand-bound GPCR can activate multiple Gs proteins (amplification ~10-100x) because the receptor acts catalytically, activating one Gs after another while the ligand remains bound. (2) Each active Gs-alpha stimulates adenylyl cyclase, which produces ~100 cAMP molecules per second (amplification ~100x). (3) cAMP activates PKA (4 cAMP per PKA holoenzyme), and each active PKA catalytic subunit phosphorylates many substrate molecules per second (~10-100 substrates, amplification ~10-100x). (4) If the substrate is itself an enzyme (e.g., phosphorylase kinase in glycogen signaling), further amplification occurs. In the classic epinephrine → glycogen breakdown cascade, Sutherland calculated that one epinephrine molecule could trigger the release of ~10 million glucose molecules — an amplification of ~10^7. This cascade amplification explains how nanomolar hormone concentrations can produce massive cellular responses.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In the absence of Wnt ligand, beta-catenin is continuously targeted for destruction by the 'destruction complex.' This cytoplasmic complex consists of the scaffold protein Axin, the tumor suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), and two kinases: CK1alpha (casein kinase 1) and GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta). CK1alpha first phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser45 (priming phosphorylation), which allows GSK3beta to sequentially phosphorylate Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41. This phosphodegron motif is recognized by beta-TrCP (an E3 ubiquitin ligase adapter), leading to K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When Wnt binds Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor, Dishevelled (Dvl) is recruited and disrupts the destruction complex by promoting Axin sequestration to the membrane. This stabilizes beta-catenin, which accumulates, enters the nucleus, and forms a complex with TCF/LEF transcription factors, activating Wnt target genes (c-Myc, cyclin D1). APC mutations (found in >80% of colorectal cancers) prevent destruction complex function, constitutively stabilizing beta-catenin.",

      "explanation": "Nitric oxide (NO) has several unique properties as a signaling molecule: (1) It is a small, uncharged gas radical (31 Da) that freely diffuses across cell membranes without requiring channels or receptors — it acts on intracellular targets directly. (2) It is synthesized on demand by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) from L-arginine + O2 → L-citrulline + NO, using NADPH and BH4 as cofactors. Three NOS isoforms exist: eNOS (endothelial), nNOS (neuronal), and iNOS (inducible, in macrophages). (3) NO has an extremely short half-life (~5 seconds in biological fluids) because it reacts rapidly with O2, superoxide, and hemoglobin, limiting its range to nearby cells (paracrine/autocrine). (4) NO's primary target is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) — NO binds the heme group of sGC, causing a conformational change that activates GTP → cGMP production. cGMP then activates PKG (protein kinase G), leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation), platelet inhibition, and neurotransmission. This NO/cGMP pathway is the target of sildenafil (Viagra), which inhibits PDE5 (cGMP phosphodiesterase).",

Even under maximal adenylyl cyclase activation (by forskolin, which directly activates the catalytic subunit), phosphodiesterases continuously hydrolyze cAMP to 5'-AMP. The steady-state cAMP level (150 pmol/mg with forskolin) represents the balance point where production equals degradation. Adding IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a non-selective PDE inhibitor) blocks cAMP degradation, causing levels to rise to 400 pmol/mg — nearly 3× higher. This reveals that PDEs are highly active even during strong adenylyl cyclase stimulation, constantly clearing cAMP. The H-89 control (PKA inhibitor) shows that high cAMP (160, similar to forskolin alone) fails to produce PKA activity (12%), confirming H-89 specifically blocks PKA catalytic activity without affecting cAMP production. Cholera toxin produces similar results to forskolin (cAMP 180, PKA 90%) but through a different mechanism — permanent activation of Gs-alpha.

This confirms Ras as a central node between RTK and MAPK signaling. Second, the inability of EGF to further stimulate ERK in RasG12V cells reveals robust negative feedback. Sustained Ras-ERK signaling activates multiple negative regulators: (1) DUSP/MKP (dual-specificity phosphatases) are ERK target genes that dephosphorylate ERK; (2) Sprouty proteins (Spry1-4), also ERK targets, inhibit Ras-Raf interaction; (3) ERK phosphorylates SOS1 (the Ras GEF), causing its dissociation from Grb2 and preventing Ras activation; (4) ERK phosphorylates EGFR on Thr669, promoting receptor internalization. These feedbacks create a system where the pathway reaches a new steady state at moderate activity that cannot be further pushed by EGF.

If the cellular response to the ligand is blocked by PT, the receptor likely couples to Gi. If CT mimics the ligand's effect, the receptor likely couples to Gs. (3) GTPgammaS (non-hydrolyzable GTP analog) can test for G-protein involvement in permeabilized cells.

The three-part strategy: (1) Dominant-negative Ras (RasN17, which binds GEFs but cannot exchange GDP for GTP, sequestering GEFs) should block EGF → Ras → kinase X signaling. If kinase X activation by EGF is abolished by RasN17, kinase X acts downstream of Ras. (2) Constitutively active Ras (RasG12V) should activate kinase X independently of upstream receptor signaling. If RasG12V activates kinase X in the absence of EGF, kinase X is downstream of Ras. (3) A specific kinase X inhibitor should block RasG12V-induced effects (e.g., ERK phosphorylation, transcription) without reducing Ras-GTP levels, confirming kinase X acts downstream of Ras but upstream of the measured output. Together, these results place kinase X unambiguously between Ras and the downstream readout.

Cytokine receptors (for interferons, interleukins, growth hormone, erythropoietin) lack intrinsic kinase activity but constitutively associate with Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2). Ligand-induced receptor dimerization brings JAKs into proximity, causing trans-phosphorylation and activation. Activated JAKs phosphorylate specific tyrosines on the receptor cytoplasmic tails, creating docking sites for STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) proteins. STATs bind via their SH2 domains and are phosphorylated by JAKs on a conserved tyrosine residue (~Tyr701 in STAT1). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize (pTyr-SH2 reciprocal interactions), translocate to the nucleus, and directly bind GAS (gamma-activated sequence) or ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) DNA elements.

At low cell density, AHL concentration is insufficient to activate the transcription factor LuxR. As bacteria multiply, AHL accumulates proportionally.

The mechanism of inhibition may involve Ptc acting as a transporter that removes activating oxysterols from the membrane environment around Smo. Without Smo activation, the full-length Gli transcription factors (Gli2, Gli3) are processed by proteasomal cleavage into transcriptional repressors (GliR), mediated by the PKA/CK1/GSK3beta phosphorylation complex associated with the Gli-Sufu complex. In the ON state: Hedgehog ligand (Shh, Ihh, or Dhh) binds Patched, relieving its inhibition of Smoothened. Smo accumulates in the primary cilium, where it blocks Gli processing and promotes the formation of full-length Gli activators (GliA).

The process involves two key players: (1) GRKs (GRK2/beta-ARK1 is the best studied) are serine/threonine kinases that specifically recognize and phosphorylate agonist-occupied (active) GPCRs. GRK2 is recruited to the membrane by binding free Gbetagamma subunits released during receptor activation. GRK phosphorylates serine/threonine clusters in the receptor's C-terminal tail and third intracellular loop. (2) Beta-arrestins (beta-arr1 and beta-arr2) bind to GRK-phosphorylated receptors with high affinity. Arrestin binding has three consequences: it physically blocks the receptor's interaction surface for G proteins (homologous desensitization); it serves as an adaptor for clathrin and AP-2, targeting the receptor for clathrin-coated pit internalization; and it acts as a scaffold for additional signaling (MAPK, Src). Internalized receptors are either dephosphorylated and recycled (resensitization) or ubiquitinated and targeted to lysosomes (downregulation). This GRK/arrestin mechanism is a general GPCR regulatory module.",

      "explanation": "TGF-beta superfamily signaling (TGF-beta, BMPs, activins, nodal) uses a unique receptor serine/threonine kinase system. TGF-beta ligands are dimeric and bind a heterotetrameric receptor complex consisting of two type II receptors (constitutively active kinases) and two type I receptors (initially inactive). Ligand binding induces complex formation, and the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor on serine/threonine residues in a GS domain (glycine-serine rich region) near its kinase domain. Activated type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-Smads (R-Smads): Smad2/3 for TGF-beta/activin, or Smad1/5/8 for BMPs. The phosphorylated R-Smad binds the co-Smad (Smad4), and this complex translocates to the nucleus where it associates with DNA-binding transcription factors (FoxH1, Runx) and co-activators (p300/CBP) to regulate target gene expression. Inhibitory Smads (Smad6, Smad7) provide negative feedback. This pathway regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in pathway components are common in cancer (Smad4/DPC4 loss in pancreatic cancer).",

      "explanation": "Gap junctions form direct cytoplasmic channels between adjacent cells by the docking of two hemichannels (connexons), each composed of six connexin (Cx) subunits. The resulting channel has a pore diameter of approximately 1.5-2 nm, which allows passage of molecules up to approximately 1 kDa (1,000 Daltons). This size cutoff permits passage of: inorganic ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-); small metabolites (glucose, amino acids, nucleotides); and critically, second messengers (cAMP, cGMP, IP3, Ca2+). This allows metabolic cooperation between coupled cells and propagation of signaling waves (e.g., Ca2+ waves across tissues). Larger molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides cannot pass. Gap junction permeability is regulated by: intracellular pH (low pH closes channels), Ca2+ concentration (high Ca2+ closes channels), phosphorylation by PKC/PKA/Src, and voltage. Different connexin isoforms (21 in humans) form channels with different permeability properties.

In resting cells, NF-kappaB is kept in the cytoplasm by association with IkappaB (IkappaBalpha being the most studied isoform). IkappaB contains ankyrin repeat domains that bind NF-kappaB and mask its nuclear localization signal (NLS), preventing nuclear entry. Upon stimulation (by TNF-alpha, IL-1, LPS, pathogens, UV radiation), receptor-proximal signaling converges on the IKK complex (IkappaB kinase, consisting of IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and the regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKgamma). IKK phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at Ser32 and Ser36, creating a phosphodegron recognized by the SCF-betaTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. K48-linked polyubiquitination targets IkappaBalpha for 26S proteasomal degradation. The released NF-kappaB rapidly translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of hundreds of target genes including cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-8), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), and importantly, IkappaBalpha itself — providing a negative feedback loop.",

      "explanation": "The traditional view that receptor endocytosis simply terminates signaling has been revised. 'Signaling endosomes' are internalized receptor-containing endosomes that maintain active signaling. For RTKs (EGFR, TrkA): receptors continue to signal from endosomes, and the endosomal environment can generate different downstream outputs than plasma membrane signaling. For example, EGFR signaling from endosomes preferentially activates sustained ERK through the APPL1 endosome-specific pathway. TrkA (nerve growth factor receptor) signals from signaling endosomes during retrograde axonal transport, transmitting survival signals from nerve terminals to the cell body over long distances. For GPCRs: beta-arrestin-mediated endocytosis was traditionally considered purely desensitizing, but beta-arrestin scaffolds ERK signaling from endosomes, generating sustained (rather than transient) MAPK activation. This has led to the concept of 'biased agonism' where different ligands can preferentially activate G protein or beta-arrestin pathways. The spatial context of signaling (plasma membrane vs. endosome vs. lysosome) adds another dimension to signal specificity.",

      "explanation": "Ethylene signaling in plants uses a counterintuitive 'inverse agonist' mechanism. The ethylene receptors (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, EIN4) are ER membrane-localized proteins with copper cofactors (Cu(I) in the ethylene-binding domain) that are constitutively active in the ABSENCE of ethylene. Active receptors activate CTR1 (CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE 1), a Raf-like serine/threonine kinase. Active CTR1 phosphorylates EIN2 (an NRAMP-like protein on the ER membrane), preventing its C-terminal domain from being cleaved and translocated to the nucleus. This keeps downstream transcription factors EIN3/EIL1 targeted for proteasomal degradation via the EBF1/2 F-box ubiquitin ligase pathway. When ethylene binds to the receptor's copper cofactor, the receptor is INACTIVATED, CTR1 is deactivated, EIN2 C-terminus is cleaved and moves to the nucleus (and P-bodies), EIN3/EIL1 are stabilized, and ethylene-responsive genes are activated. This is essentially a triple-negative pathway: ethylene inhibits receptors that activate an inhibitor of a positive regulator.

      "explanation": "The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated by death receptors (Fas/CD95, TNF-R1, TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5) of the TNF receptor superfamily. When FasL (a trimeric ligand) on a cytotoxic T cell binds Fas on the target cell: (1) Fas trimerizes (or pre-formed trimers undergo conformational change); (2) The cytoplasmic death domains (DD) of trimerized Fas recruit the adaptor protein FADD (Fas-Associated Death Domain protein) through homotypic DD-DD interactions; (3) FADD's death effector domain (DED) recruits procaspase-8 (and procaspase-10) through homotypic DED-DED interactions; (4) This multiprotein complex is the DISC (Death-Inducing Signaling Complex); (5) Concentrated procaspase-8 molecules undergo proximity-induced autoproteolytic cleavage, generating active caspase-8 (an initiator caspase); (6) Active caspase-8 cleaves and activates effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-7), which execute apoptosis by cleaving cellular substrates (PARP, ICAD, lamin).

There are two major families: (1) Serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B/calcineurin, PP2C) — PP1 and PP2A together account for >90% of serine/threonine phosphatase activity. PP1 is regulated by dozens of targeting subunits that direct it to specific substrates. PP2A has regulatory B subunits that determine substrate specificity.

(2) Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs): PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor; SHP2 is a signaling phosphatase that paradoxically promotes Ras-MAPK activation; CD45 is essential for T-cell receptor signaling.

      "explanation": "Signaling crosstalk occurs when components of one pathway directly regulate components of another, allowing cells to integrate multiple incoming signals. Classic examples: (1) Akt (from the PI3K/Akt survival pathway) phosphorylates Raf-1 at Ser259, creating a 14-3-3 binding site that sequesters Raf in an inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting the Ras-MAPK proliferative pathway. This crosstalk can determine whether a cell survives or proliferates. (2) PKA (from cAMP pathway) can phosphorylate Raf-1 at multiple sites (Ser43, Ser233, Ser259), inhibiting MAPK signaling in some cell types while enhancing it in others (via B-Raf). (3) Ca2+ signaling intersects with multiple pathways: CaMKII phosphorylates numerous substrates from different pathways; calcineurin (Ca2+-activated) dephosphorylates NFAT (connecting Ca2+ to gene regulation). (4) GSK3beta integrates Wnt, insulin, and mTOR signaling.

It is a pentameric channel (alpha2-beta-gamma-delta in muscle, alpha subunits bind ACh) that opens within microseconds of ACh binding, allowing Na+ (primarily) and K+ to flow down their electrochemical gradients. This generates an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) within 1-2 milliseconds — roughly 1000× faster than the fastest GPCR signaling (which requires G protein cycling, ~100 ms) and >1000000× faster than nuclear receptor signaling (which requires transcription/translation, hours).

When cAMP activates PKA, the catalytic subunits of PKA translocate to the nucleus (through nuclear pores) and phosphorylate CREB at Serine 133 within the KID (kinase-inducible domain). This single phosphorylation event creates a binding surface for CBP (CREB-binding protein) and its paralog p300. CBP/p300 are transcriptional co-activators with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity — they acetylate histones H3 and H4, opening chromatin structure, and also bridge CREB to the basal transcription machinery (TFIIB, RNA polymerase II). CREB target genes include: c-Fos (immediate early gene), somatostatin, BDNF, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and genes important for learning and memory (CREB is essential for long-term memory formation).

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: IP3Rs exhibit biphasic Ca2+ dependence — low Ca2+ concentrations potentiate IP3-induced opening (positive feedback, enabling Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, CICR), while high Ca2+ concentrations inhibit the channel (negative feedback). This biphasic regulation is crucial for generating Ca2+ oscillations and propagating Ca2+ waves. S2 is TRUE: SOCE (also called CRAC — Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ current) is a fundamental Ca2+ entry mechanism. When ER Ca2+ drops (after IP3R-mediated release), the luminal EF-hand of STIM1 loses Ca2+, triggering STIM1 oligomerization and translocation to ER-plasma membrane junctions. STIM1 directly binds and opens Orai1 (the pore-forming CRAC channel subunit) in the plasma membrane, allowing sustained Ca2+ entry from extracellular fluid to refill ER stores and maintain elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+. S3 is TRUE: Cells use frequency-modulated Ca2+ signals. Different frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations activate different transcription factors: low-frequency oscillations preferentially activate NF-kappaB, while higher frequencies activate NFAT (because calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, integrates Ca2+ over longer time windows). This frequency coding allows a single second messenger to generate diverse outputs. S4 is FALSE: Cells contain numerous Ca2+-binding proteins besides calmodulin: troponin C (muscle contraction), synaptotagmin (vesicle fusion), calpains (Ca2+-dependent proteases), PKC (conventional isoforms), annexins (membrane binding), S100 proteins (cell growth), and calreticulin/calnexin (ER protein quality control).

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Auxin signaling uses a novel receptor mechanism. IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) acts as 'molecular glue' between TIR1 (an F-box protein in the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex) and Aux/IAA repressor proteins. Auxin fills a cavity at the TIR1-Aux/IAA interface, stabilizing their interaction. This leads to polyubiquitination and 26S proteasomal degradation of Aux/IAA proteins, freeing ARF (Auxin Response Factor) transcription factors to activate auxin-responsive genes. S2 is TRUE: GA signaling is remarkably parallel. GID1 (GA-Insensitive Dwarf 1) is a soluble GA receptor. GA binding triggers conformational change in GID1 that enables binding to DELLA proteins (growth-repressing transcription regulators). The GID1-GA-DELLA complex is recognized by the SCF-SLY1/GID2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to DELLA ubiquitination and degradation. This derepresses growth-promoting genes. S3 is TRUE: ABA perception involves PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. ABA binding to PYR1 promotes its interaction with PP2C phosphatases (ABI1, ABI2, HAB1), inhibiting them. Without PP2C activity, SnRK2 kinases (which are normally dephosphorylated and inactivated by PP2Cs) autophosphorylate, activate, and phosphorylate downstream targets including ion channels (SLAC1, KAT1) for stomatal closure and transcription factors (ABF/AREB) for stress gene expression. S4 is FALSE: Plants DO use two-component signaling. Cytokinin signaling is mediated by histidine kinases (AHK2, AHK3, CRE1/AHK4) that initiate a His→Asp phosphorelay to response regulators (ARRs). Ethylene receptors (ETR1) also have histidine kinase domains. This two-component system was inherited from prokaryotic ancestors.",

What do these two effects tell you about the phosphatase's mechanism?",
      "options": [
        "The rightward shift indicates the phosphatase reduces the system's sensitivity by directly dephosphorylating ERK or upstream kinases, requiring more ligand for equivalent activation; the reduced maximum (ceiling) indicates the phosphatase activity cannot be fully overcome even at saturating ligand, because the kinase/phosphatase balance reaches a new steady state below the normal maximum",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The dose-response curve reveals two distinct effects of the constitutively active phosphatase. (1) Rightward shift (increased EC50): The phosphatase directly opposes kinase activity in the ERK pathway, meaning that at any given ligand concentration, the net phosphorylation level (= kinase rate / (kinase rate + phosphatase rate)) is lower than normal. More ligand is required to achieve the same level of activation, shifting the EC50 to higher concentrations. This is analogous to competitive antagonism but at the level of the signaling cascade rather than the receptor. (2) Reduced maximum response: Even at saturating ligand concentrations (1000 nM), where kinase activity is maximal, the phosphatase continues to dephosphorylate ERK. The new steady state reaches only 65% of normal maximum because the phosphatase rate is constant and can offset a significant fraction of the maximal kinase rate. This is analogous to a non-competitive mechanism. Together, these effects demonstrate that signaling output is determined by the balance (ratio) of kinase and phosphatase activities, not by kinase activity alone. This 'push-pull' regulation allows precise tuning of signaling magnitude and dynamics.",

      "explanation": "These FRET biosensor data beautifully illustrate the roles of GEFs and GAPs in controlling Ras activity. In WT cells: basal Ras-GTP is low (FRET 1.0) because GAP activity (NF1 + other GAPs) exceeds basal GEF (SOS) activity. EGF transiently activates Ras (peak 4.0 at 2 min) via Grb2-SOS recruitment, then Ras-GTP declines (to 1.2 at 30 min) as GAPs hydrolyze GTP. In NF1-/- cells: basal Ras-GTP is elevated (2.5) because the dominant GAP for Ras (NF1/neurofibromin) is absent, allowing basal GEF activity to produce higher steady-state Ras-GTP. EGF produces only modest further activation (4.5, vs 4.0 in WT) because Ras is already substantially active. Critically, Ras-GTP persists (4.2 at 30 min) because the major pathway for GTP hydrolysis is eliminated. This sustained Ras activation drives the tumor predisposition in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 mutations). The dominant-negative SOS condition (blocks GEF activity) shows that EGF cannot activate Ras without functional SOS (FRET stays at ~1.0), confirming SOS is the essential GEF downstream of EGFR.

      "explanation": "The data provide a clean epistasis experiment demonstrating that PKA is the obligate mediator between cAMP and CRE-dependent gene expression. Key deductions: (1) Isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) activates CRE-luciferase 15-fold. Propranolol (beta-AR antagonist) blocks this, confirming the signal enters through the beta-AR. (2) Forskolin (which directly activates adenylyl cyclase, bypassing the receptor) activates 20-fold, confirming adenylyl cyclase → cAMP as the pathway. (3) 8-Br-cAMP (a membrane-permeable cAMP analog that bypasses both receptor and adenylyl cyclase) activates 18-fold, confirming that cAMP itself is the signal. (4) Critically, H-89 (a selective PKA inhibitor) blocks BOTH forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP stimulation to near-basal levels (~2-fold). Since 8-Br-cAMP directly provides cAMP (bypassing all upstream steps), and H-89 still blocks transcription, the data prove that PKA activity is absolutely required downstream of cAMP for CRE-dependent transcription. This is consistent with PKA phosphorylating CREB at Ser133 as the essential step for CBP/p300 recruitment and transcriptional activation. While Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP) provides a PKA-independent cAMP effector for some responses, CRE-dependent transcription appears to be PKA-dependent.",

DKK1 (Dickkopf-1) is a secreted Wnt antagonist that binds LRP5/6 co-receptor, preventing Wnt-Frizzled-LRP complex formation — it blocks the pathway at the receptor level. LiCl directly inhibits GSK3beta by competing with Mg2+ for the active site. The key epistasis result: LiCl activates TCF-luciferase (10.0-fold) regardless of DKK1 presence (9.5-fold with DKK1). Since DKK1 blocks receptor activation but cannot block LiCl-mediated activation, GSK3beta must act DOWNSTREAM of the receptor complex. Inhibiting GSK3beta stabilizes beta-catenin (prevents its phosphorylation/degradation), which then activates TCF/LEF, regardless of whether upstream Wnt signaling is blocked. The S33Y beta-catenin (mutation at a GSK3beta phosphorylation site, making beta-catenin non-degradable) is even further downstream and activates TCF (15-fold). Dominant-negative TCF4 blocks this (2.0), placing TCF downstream of beta-catenin.

At low-moderate agonist concentrations, modest IP3 production partially sensitizes IP3Rs. The oscillatory mechanism involves: (1) Small Ca2+ release from ER via partially opened IP3Rs; (2) This Ca2+ positively feeds back to further open IP3Rs (Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, CICR), causing a regenerative Ca2+ spike; (3) As cytosolic Ca2+ rises higher (~1 µM), it inhibits IP3Rs (negative feedback through the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site); (4) SERCA pumps refill the ER; Ca2+ is cleared from the cytoplasm; (5) The cycle repeats. Higher agonist concentration → more IP3 → shorter refilling time needed to re-sensitize IP3Rs → higher frequency oscillations. At very high agonist concentrations, IP3 levels saturate the IP3Rs, overwhelming the negative Ca2+ feedback. IP3Rs remain maximally open, ER Ca2+ is largely depleted, STIM1-Orai1 SOCE is maximally activated, and a sustained plateau of high cytoplasmic Ca2+ results.

Since pertussis toxin doesn't block (ruling out Gi/Go-coupled GPCRs) and the ligand doesn't enter the cell (ruling out nuclear receptors), the receptor is likely a cell-surface receptor signaling through non-Gi pathways. The immunoprecipitation approach: (1) If the immunoprecipitated receptor shows ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies like 4G10), it is likely an RTK. Co-immunoprecipitation with Grb2, Shc, or PLCgamma would further support this. (2) If the receptor co-immunoprecipitates with JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 kinases, and STAT proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine, it is likely a cytokine receptor using JAK-STAT signaling.

If Y-CA activates Z without X or receptor, Y is upstream of Z. This places components in order based on which can bypass the need for upstream signals. (2) Necessity test (DN): If X-DN blocks activation of Y, Z, and the transcription factor while leaving receptor activation normal, X is between the receptor and Y/Z. If Y-DN blocks Z and TF but not X, Y is between X and Z. This establishes that each component is required for downstream activation. (3) Rescue test: If Y-CA restores pathway output in cells expressing X-DN, Y is downstream of X. This confirms the ordering is linear (not parallel). For example, in mapping the Ras-MAPK cascade: RasG12V (CA) activates ERK without EGF; MEK-DN blocks ERK activation without affecting Ras-GTP; ERK-CA (or a constitutive MEK) rescues the MEK-DN block on nuclear transcription factor phosphorylation.

In the inactive state (Galpha-GDP bound to Gbetagamma), the tags are in close proximity (<10 nm), producing BRET signal. Upon GPCR activation, Galpha exchanges GDP for GTP and dissociates from Gbetagamma, increasing the distance between tags and reducing BRET signal. The decrease in BRET directly reports G protein activation with sub-second temporal resolution. When RGS proteins accelerate GTP hydrolysis and Galpha-GDP reassociates with Gbetagamma, BRET recovers.

      "explanation": "Systematic pharmacological epistasis is an efficient approach to identify the level of oncogenic activation in a signaling cascade. The logic: if a component is constitutively active due to mutation (gain-of-function), inhibiting that component or anything downstream will reduce p-ERK, but inhibiting upstream components will have no effect. Example scenarios: (1) If erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor) reduces p-ERK: the activating event is at or upstream of EGFR (e.g., EGFR amplification/mutation, autocrine ligand loop). (2) If erlotinib has no effect but a Ras inhibitor reduces p-ERK: Ras is likely mutated (e.g., KRAS G12V). (3) If Ras inhibitors have no effect but vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) reduces p-ERK: BRAF is likely mutated (e.g., V600E, common in melanoma). (4) If only MEK inhibitors reduce p-ERK: MEK may be constitutively active (rare) or an activating mutation exists between Raf and MEK. This approach guides targeted sequencing: once the level is identified, sequence that specific gene. In practice, this strategy has been instrumental in personalizing cancer therapy — BRAF V600E melanomas respond to vemurafenib+trametinib, while KRAS-mutant tumors do not respond to EGFR inhibitors.",

The sensor histidine kinase (HK) is typically a transmembrane protein with an extracellular/periplasmic sensing domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. Upon detecting a stimulus (environmental change in osmolarity, nutrients, pH, antibiotics, quorum signals), the HK autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue using ATP. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to a conserved aspartate residue on the receiver domain of the response regulator (RR). Phosphorylation activates the RR's output domain, which is most commonly a DNA-binding domain that activates or represses target gene transcription. The phosphoaspartate has a finite half-life and can be accelerated by phosphatase activity (often intrinsic to the HK), providing signal termination. Classic examples: EnvZ/OmpR (osmolarity sensing), CheA/CheY (chemotaxis), PhoR/PhoB (phosphate limitation). E. coli has about 30 TCSs.",

Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63) and the N-terminal methionine (M1), allowing different chain topologies with distinct functions. K48-linked chains are the classical degradation signal, recognized by the 26S proteasome. K63-linked chains, however, serve primarily as non-degradative signaling scaffolds. In NF-kappaB signaling, TRAF6 (an E3 ligase) catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKKgamma and TRAF6 itself. These K63 chains recruit TAB2/3 (via their ubiquitin-binding NZF domains), which activate TAK1 kinase, leading to IKK activation. In DNA damage response, RNF8/RNF168 E3 ligases build K63 chains on histones near DNA breaks, recruiting BRCA1 and 53BP1 for repair. Monoubiquitination serves yet other functions: histone H2B monoubiquitination regulates transcription; PCNA monoubiquitination activates translesion synthesis. Linear (M1-linked) chains (assembled by LUBAC: HOIP, HOIL-1L, SHARPIN) also play signaling roles in NF-kappaB and cell death pathways. This 'ubiquitin code' rivals phosphorylation in signaling complexity.",

In hepatocytes, cAMP → PKA → phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase → glycogen breakdown. In adipocytes, cAMP → PKA → phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase → lipolysis. In olfactory neurons, cAMP directly opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels → depolarization. The difference lies in the cell's 'signaling toolkit': which PKA substrates are expressed, which AKAP (A-kinase anchoring protein) scaffolds are present (localizing PKA to specific subcellular compartments), which phosphodiesterase isoforms are expressed (shaping the temporal dynamics of cAMP), and which downstream transcription factors and effectors are available.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: In the absence of Wnt, the destruction complex efficiently marks beta-catenin for degradation. CK1alpha phosphorylates Ser45 (priming), then GSK3beta sequentially phosphorylates Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33. The N-terminal phosphodegron is recognized by beta-TrCP (an F-box protein in the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase), leading to K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This keeps cytoplasmic beta-catenin at very low levels. S2 is TRUE: Wnt binding to Frizzled (Fzd, a 7-TM receptor) and the co-receptor LRP5/6 triggers a cascade: Dishevelled (Dvl) is recruited and oligomerizes, LRP6 is phosphorylated by CK1gamma and GSK3beta (paradoxically), and the phosphorylated LRP6 intracellular domain directly binds Axin, sequestering it at the membrane. This dismantles the destruction complex, preventing beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. S3 is FALSE: Beta-catenin does NOT directly bind DNA. It lacks a DNA-binding domain. Instead, it enters the nucleus and binds the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors (TCF1, LEF1, TCF3, TCF4), which provide the DNA-binding specificity. Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator, recruiting p300/CBP and other chromatin modifiers to TCF/LEF-bound promoters. Without beta-catenin, TCF/LEF associates with Groucho/TLE co-repressors. S4 is TRUE: APC is the most commonly mutated gene in colorectal cancer. APC loss prevents destruction complex formation, leading to constitutive beta-catenin stabilization and activation of Wnt target genes (c-Myc, cyclin D1, MMP7) that drive proliferation.

The secreted ligand can bind receptors on the same cell (true autocrine) or on neighboring cells of the same type (paracrine to same cell type). This creates positive feedback that can amplify signals and drive coordinated responses within a cell population. S2 is FALSE: Autocrine signaling is an important part of normal physiology. Examples include: activated T cells producing IL-2 that stimulates their own proliferation (essential for adaptive immunity); developmental signals where groups of equivalent cells coordinate fate decisions; wound healing where platelets release PDGF that acts on themselves and nearby cells. It is not exclusively pathological. S3 is TRUE: Autocrine growth factor production is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg). Many tumors overexpress both growth factors and their receptors: TGF-alpha/EGFR in breast and lung cancers; PDGF/PDGFR in glioblastomas; VEGF/VEGFR in many solid tumors (also paracrine to endothelium); HGF/Met in gastric cancers. This self-sufficiency in growth signals allows cancer cells to proliferate independently of external mitogenic stimulation. S4 is TRUE: Disrupting autocrine loops is a validated therapeutic strategy. Cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) blocks ligand binding; erlotinib/gefitinib (EGFR kinase inhibitors) block receptor activation; bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) blocks the VEGF autocrine/paracrine loop.

The GPCR is genetically fused to TurboID (an engineered biotin ligase with ~10 min labeling time) or miniTurbo at its C-terminus. When biotin is added to the culture medium, TurboID generates reactive biotinoyl-AMP that covalently biotinylates lysine residues on proteins within a ~10 nm radius. By adding biotin at specific times after agonist stimulation (or using photocaged biotin), one can capture the dynamic interactome of the activated receptor. Biotinylated proteins are affinity-purified using streptavidin beads under stringent conditions (because biotin-streptavidin binding survives detergent, high salt, and denaturants) and identified by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. This approach has advantages over traditional co-IP: it captures weak/transient interactions, works with membrane proteins that are difficult to immunoprecipitate, and preserves spatial information.

(2) pAkt is completely abolished by wortmannin at all time points — this is expected because Akt activation absolutely requires PIP3 (produced by PI3K) for membrane recruitment and PDK1-mediated phosphorylation. (3) pERK is completely unaffected by wortmannin — demonstrating that ERK activation by EGFR does NOT require PI3K activity. ERK is activated through the Grb2→SOS→Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK cascade, which branches off EGFR independently of PI3K. This parallel branching architecture (known as 'fan-out') is a general principle in RTK signaling: a single phosphorylated receptor simultaneously recruits and activates multiple independent downstream modules (Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, PLCgamma, STAT3) through different phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions.

      "explanation": "The duration of ERK activation encodes distinct information. In PC12 cells (a classic model), transient ERK activation (by EGF, ~5-15 minutes) promotes proliferation, while sustained ERK activation (by NGF, hours) promotes neuronal differentiation. The molecular mechanism involves a temporal filter: (1) Both transient and sustained ERK induce immediate early genes (IEGs) like c-Fos within minutes. (2) c-Fos protein is inherently unstable (half-life ~30 minutes) and is rapidly degraded. (3) Sustained ERK activity phosphorylates c-Fos directly, stabilizing it (half-life extends to hours). Transient ERK cannot maintain c-Fos phosphorylation, so c-Fos is degraded. (4) Stabilized c-Fos (only with sustained ERK) heterodimerizes with c-Jun to form AP-1, which activates a secondary wave of gene expression (including differentiation genes). This creates an 'AND gate': c-Fos accumulation requires both its induction (rapid, any ERK signal) AND its stabilization (slow, requires sustained ERK). Additional mechanisms include ERK-mediated induction of DUSP (dual-specificity phosphatases) for negative feedback, and nuclear accumulation of ERK during sustained activation.",

Plasmodesmata are channels that traverse the thick plant cell wall (200-400 nm long), lined by plasma membrane continuous between the two cells. A central element, the desmotubule (a compressed ER tubule), runs through the center, leaving an annular cytoplasmic sleeve (~2.5 nm wide) for transport. The size exclusion limit (SEL) is typically ~800-1000 Da for simple PD but can be modified: some viral movement proteins and transcription factors (like KNOTTED1, SHORT-ROOT) traffic through PD by increasing the SEL via interaction with PD-associated proteins. Callose (beta-1,3-glucan) deposition at PD necks can restrict their aperture. Gap junctions, in contrast, are protein-assembled pores made of connexin hexamers (connexons), without any ER involvement, spanning only the ~2-4 nm intercellular space.

Rheb-GTP directly activates mTORC1. (2) Amino acids (especially leucine, arginine) activate Rag GTPases (RagA/B-RagC/D heterodimers) at the lysosomal surface, which recruit mTORC1 to the lysosome where it encounters Rheb. The Ragulator complex and SLC38A9 (lysosomal amino acid transporter) mediate amino acid sensing.

The cycling between states is regulated by: GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) that promote GDP release, allowing GTP (10× more abundant than GDP in the cytoplasm) to bind and activate the GTPase.

        "R-Smads (Smad2/3 for TGF-beta, Smad1/5/8 for BMP) are directly phosphorylated by type I receptors at the C-terminal SSXS motif; Co-Smad (Smad4) partners with phosphorylated R-Smads for nuclear translocation; I-Smads (Smad6/7) inhibit the pathway by competing for receptor binding or recruiting phosphatases and E3 ligases",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Smad family has three functional classes with distinct roles in TGF-beta superfamily signaling: (1) R-Smads (receptor-regulated Smads): Smad2 and Smad3 are specific to TGF-beta/activin/nodal signaling; Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are specific to BMP/GDF signaling. They contain an MH1 (DNA-binding) and MH2 (protein interaction) domain connected by a linker. The type I receptor phosphorylates the C-terminal SSXS motif on the MH2 domain, inducing conformational change. (2) Co-Smad: Smad4 (also called DPC4, Deleted in Pancreatic Cancer 4) is the common mediator. It does not get phosphorylated by receptors but binds phosphorylated R-Smads through MH2-MH2 domain interactions, forming heteromeric complexes (typically R-Smad2-Smad4 trimers) that accumulate in the nucleus. Smad4 is a tumor suppressor lost in ~50% of pancreatic cancers. (3) I-Smads (inhibitory): Smad6 (primarily inhibits BMP pathway) and Smad7 (inhibits both TGF-beta and BMP) provide negative feedback. They compete with R-Smads for type I receptor binding, recruit SMURF1/2 E3 ubiquitin ligases to the receptor (targeting it for degradation), and recruit PP1 phosphatase to dephosphorylate the receptor. Smad7 expression is induced by TGF-beta itself, creating a negative feedback loop.",

      "explanation": "The Eph/ephrin system is the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases and exhibits unique bidirectional signaling. Eph receptors (EphA1-10, EphB1-6) bind membrane-bound ephrin ligands on adjacent cells — ephrin-As are GPI-anchored, ephrin-Bs are transmembrane proteins with a cytoplasmic tail. Upon binding: Forward signaling occurs in the Eph-expressing cell: EphB receptors dimerize, trans-autophosphorylate on tyrosines, and activate downstream signaling (Ras/MAPK, PI3K, Rho GTPases) through SH2 domain proteins (Grb10, Nck, phospholipase C). Reverse signaling occurs in the ephrin-expressing cell: ephrin-B's cytoplasmic tail becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases, recruiting SH2/PDZ domain proteins (Grb4, GRIP) that activate downstream effectors (Rac, MAPK). Ephrin-A reverse signaling occurs through associated Src family kinases or other GPI-associated signaling molecules. This bidirectional communication is crucial for: axon guidance (repulsive/attractive), tissue boundary formation (rhombomere boundaries), vascular development (arteries express ephrin-B2, veins express EphB4), and synaptic plasticity.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Bcl-2 family proteins are the central regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, acting at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). The family is divided into three groups: (1) Pro-survival/anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, A1): these contain BH1-4 domains and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins, preventing MOM permeabilization. (2) Pro-apoptotic effectors (Bax and Bak): these can oligomerize and form pores in the MOM, releasing cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and AIF into the cytoplasm. (3) BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, Bad, Puma, Noxa): these are the sentinels that sense cellular stress. 'Activator' BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim) directly activate Bax/Bak oligomerization. 'Sensitizer' BH3-only proteins (Bad, Noxa) bind and neutralize pro-survival members, freeing activators. The life-death decision depends on the stoichiometric balance: when pro-apoptotic signals (from DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, ER stress) induce BH3-only proteins that overwhelm the buffering capacity of pro-survival members, Bax/Bak oligomerize and permeabilize the MOM. Released cytochrome c binds Apaf-1, forming the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9 → caspase-3.

The gamma subunit contains four CBS (cystathionine beta-synthase) domains that bind adenine nucleotides. Under normal energy conditions, ATP occupies these sites, keeping AMPK in a low-activity state. When energy drops (increased metabolic demand, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, exercise), ATP is consumed and AMP/ADP accumulate. AMP binding to the gamma subunit has three synergistic effects: (1) It promotes phosphorylation of Thr172 on the alpha subunit activation loop by the upstream kinase LKB1 (a constitutively active tumor suppressor kinase) — AMP binding causes conformational change exposing Thr172. (2) It protects pThr172 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (PP2A, PP2C). (3) It allosterically activates the phosphorylated enzyme up to 10-fold. Together, these mechanisms create >1000-fold activation sensitivity. Activated AMPK phosphorylates substrates to restore energy balance: it activates catabolic pathways (fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, autophagy) and inhibits anabolic pathways (fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis via mTORC1 inhibition, gluconeogenesis).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SH2 (Src Homology 2) domains are ~100 amino acid modules that serve as phosphotyrosine-recognition devices in signal transduction. The SH2 domain structure (first solved by Waksman/Kuriyan for Src SH2) reveals a central beta-sheet flanked by two alpha-helices, with two critical pockets: (1) The pTyr-binding pocket: contains a conserved arginine (Arg-betaB5) that forms a salt bridge with the phosphate group of phosphotyrosine. Additional hydrogen bonds from backbone amines and a conserved serine stabilize the interaction. This provides the phosphorylation-dependent switch — unphosphorylated tyrosine has ~1000-fold lower affinity. (2) The specificity-determining pocket: a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the pTyr site that accommodates the 1-5 amino acids C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (the '+1, +2, +3' positions). Different SH2 domains have different pocket shapes, creating binding specificity. For example, Grb2 SH2 prefers pYXN motifs; PI3K p85 SH2 prefers pYXXM; PLCgamma SH2 prefers pYIIL. This specificity allows different SH2 proteins to be selectively recruited to different phosphotyrosine sites on the same activated RTK, creating a phosphotyrosine code that determines which signaling pathways are activated.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The French Flag model (proposed by Lewis Wolpert in 1969) explains how a continuous morphogen gradient can generate discrete domains of cell fate. A morphogen is produced by a localized source and spreads through the tissue by diffusion (and active transport), establishing a concentration gradient. Different target genes have promoters with different sensitivity to the morphogen's transcription factor: high-threshold genes are activated only near the source (high concentration = 'blue'), medium-threshold genes are activated at intermediate distances ('white'), and low-threshold genes are activated far from the source ('red'). The classical example is Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the vertebrate neural tube: high Shh concentrations (ventral, near the floor plate source) specify motor neurons and V3 interneurons; intermediate concentrations specify V2 interneurons; low concentrations specify V1 interneurons. In Drosophila, Bicoid mRNA (localized maternally at the anterior) produces a protein gradient that activates different gap genes (hunchback, giant, Kruppel) at different concentration thresholds. The thresholds are determined by the affinity and number of morphogen transcription factor binding sites in target gene enhancers.",

      "explanation": "The UPR has three signaling branches, each with a distinct ER-localized sensor: (1) IRE1alpha: a transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, BiP/GRP78 dissociates from IRE1 (derepression), or unfolded proteins directly bind IRE1's luminal domain. IRE1 oligomerizes and trans-autophosphorylates, activating its cytoplasmic RNase domain. IRE1 performs an unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA — excising a 26-nucleotide intron without the spliceosome. This frameshift produces XBP1s (spliced), an active bZIP transcription factor that upregulates genes for ER protein folding (chaperones), ERAD (ER-associated degradation), and lipid biosynthesis (ER expansion). IRE1 can also degrade other ER-localized mRNAs (RIDD, regulated IRE1-dependent decay). (2) PERK: phosphorylates eIF2alpha, reducing global translation while selectively enhancing translation of ATF4 mRNA. (3) ATF6: translocates to the Golgi where S1P and S2P proteases cleave it (RIP), releasing an active transcription factor domain.

      "explanation": "Ultrasensitivity refers to responses that are steeper than the standard Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic curve (Hill coefficient > 1), approaching a switch-like (all-or-none) behavior. Several molecular mechanisms achieve this in signaling pathways: (1) Cooperative binding (as in hemoglobin, or cooperative kinase activation): positive cooperativity creates a sigmoidal dose-response. (2) Multi-site phosphorylation: requiring multiple phosphorylation events for activation (e.g., CDK substrates with many phosphorylation sites) creates an ultrasensitive response because the probability of all sites being phosphorylated increases sharply above a threshold kinase/phosphatase ratio (distributive multisite phosphorylation). (3) Positive feedback: creates bistability (two stable steady states) where the system exists in either a fully OFF or fully ON state, with a sharp transition between them. Examples include the Mos-MEK-ERK cascade in Xenopus oocyte maturation. (4) Zero-order ultrasensitivity (Goldbeter-Koshland): when kinase and phosphatase are both near saturation, small changes in input produce large changes in output.

Each AKAP contains: (1) a PKA-binding domain (amphipathic helix that binds the D/D domain on PKA-RII or PKA-RI regulatory subunits); (2) a subcellular targeting domain (lipid anchor, transmembrane domain, or organelle-targeting sequence); and (3) binding sites for other signaling proteins (phosphatases, PDEs, other kinases). By tethering PKA to specific subcellular locations, AKAPs create signaling microdomains where cAMP levels and PKA activity are locally regulated. For example, AKAP79/150 at the plasma membrane positions PKA near L-type Ca2+ channels and beta-adrenergic receptors; AKAP-Lbc at the cytoskeleton scaffolds PKA with Rho signaling; D-AKAP1 at the mitochondrial outer membrane positions PKA for BAD phosphorylation (pro-survival).

      "explanation": "Lateral inhibition via Delta-Notch signaling is a self-organizing mechanism that generates fine-grained cell fate patterns from initially equivalent cell populations. The mechanism involves: (1) In a field of equivalent cells, all express both Delta (ligand) and Notch (receptor) at similar levels. (2) Small stochastic fluctuations give some cells slightly higher Delta expression. (3) These high-Delta cells more strongly activate Notch in their neighbors. (4) Activated Notch (NICD) induces transcription of Hes/Hey bHLH repressors, which transcriptionally repress Delta expression (and often proneural genes like Atonal/Neurogenin). (5) Cells with active Notch (high Hes) therefore reduce Delta, becoming 'signal-receiving' cells. Their low Delta means they cannot activate Notch in the originally high-Delta neighbor, which maintains high Delta and low Notch — becoming the 'signal-sending' cell. (6) This mutual inhibition (positive feedback loop) amplifies initial small differences into a stable binary pattern: alternating high-Delta/low-Notch cells and low-Delta/high-Notch cells.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Class IA PI3K is a heterodimer of a regulatory subunit (p85, with SH2 domains) and a catalytic subunit (p110). RTK activation creates phosphotyrosine motifs (pYXXM) that recruit p85's SH2 domains, relieving p85's inhibition of p110 and localizing PI3K to the plasma membrane near its substrate PIP2. p110 phosphorylates PIP2 at the 3' position to produce PIP3. PIP3 recruits PH domain-containing proteins including Akt (PKB) and PDK1 to the membrane. S2 is TRUE: PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a dual-specificity phosphatase whose primary physiological function is as a 3'-lipid phosphatase: it removes the 3' phosphate from PIP3, regenerating PIP2. This directly opposes PI3K activity, making PTEN the major brake on Akt signaling. PTEN is one of the most commonly mutated/deleted tumor suppressors in human cancer (prostate, breast, endometrial, glioblastoma). PTEN loss → constitutive PIP3 → constitutive Akt → cell survival and proliferation. S3 is FALSE: Akt phosphorylates Bad at Ser136, but this INACTIVATES Bad (not activates it). Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered by 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm, preventing it from binding and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL proteins at the mitochondria. Thus Akt promotes survival by inactivating the pro-apoptotic Bad. Other Akt survival targets include FOXO transcription factors (phosphorylated and excluded from the nucleus), caspase-9 (inactivated), and MDM2 (activated, promoting p53 degradation). S4 is TRUE: TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin) form a complex where TSC2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb. TSC2-GAP activity converts Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP, keeping mTORC1 inactive. Akt phosphorylates TSC2 at multiple sites (Ser939, Thr1462), inhibiting its GAP activity. This allows Rheb to remain in the active GTP-bound state, which directly binds and activates mTORC1, promoting protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and cell growth.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Nuclear receptor ligands are small, hydrophobic molecules that freely cross the plasma membrane. These include steroid hormones (cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, aldosterone), thyroid hormones (T3/T4), retinoids (retinoic acid), vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), fatty acid derivatives, and oxysterols. Their lipophilicity allows passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer. S2 is TRUE: Ligand binding induces conformational change in the receptor (particularly helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain, which repositions to create a co-activator binding surface). Receptors bind DNA as homodimers (steroid receptors: GR, ER, PR, AR) or heterodimers (with RXR: RAR, VDR, TR, PPAR). HREs are typically inverted repeats (steroid receptors) or direct repeats with variable spacing (RXR heterodimers). Co-activators (SRC-1/2/3, p300/CBP) have LXXLL motifs and possess HAT activity; co-repressors (NCoR, SMRT) have CoRNR boxes and recruit HDACs. S3 is FALSE: The unliganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resides in the CYTOPLASM, sequestered in a complex with Hsp90, Hsp70, and immunophilins (FKBP51/52). Cortisol binding causes Hsp90 dissociation, exposing the nuclear localization signal. GR then translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes, and binds glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). Some nuclear receptors (TR, RAR) are constitutively nuclear, bound to DNA even without ligand (but associated with co-repressors). S4 is TRUE: The nuclear receptor superfamily includes 48 members in humans. Many were identified by sequence homology before their ligands were known — these 'orphan' receptors have been gradually deorphanized. PPARgamma was found to bind thiazolidinediones (synthetic) and fatty acid derivatives (natural), making it a key target for type 2 diabetes therapy. Some orphan receptors may function as constitutive activators or sensors of metabolic intermediates.",

They are activated downstream of RTKs, GPCRs, integrins, and cadherins, linking extracellular signals to cytoskeletal reorganization for cell migration, adhesion, division, and morphogenesis. S2 is TRUE: These three GTPases organize distinct actin structures (as demonstrated by Hall and Nobes using microinjection experiments in fibroblasts): RhoA activates ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) and mDia (formin), promoting actomyosin contractility, stress fiber assembly, and focal adhesion maturation. Rac1 activates the WAVE complex → Arp2/3 complex, promoting branched actin polymerization and lamellipodia (flat membrane protrusions). Cdc42 activates WASP → Arp2/3 and formins, promoting filopodia (thin spike-like protrusions) that sense the environment. S3 is TRUE: Like Ras, Rho GTPases cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states, regulated by: ~80 RhoGEFs (Dbl-homology domain) that activate; ~70 RhoGAPs that inactivate; and RhoGDIs (Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitors) that sequester the GDP-bound form in the cytoplasm. S4 is FALSE: Rho GTPases also regulate gene transcription. RhoA activates SRF (serum response factor) via MAL/MRTF (which senses actin dynamics). Rac and Cdc42 activate JNK and p38 MAPK cascades leading to AP-1 and ATF-2 transcription factor activation. Cdc42 activates NF-kappaB through PAK → IKK.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The Hippo pathway (discovered in Drosophila as a regulator of tissue growth) is a conserved kinase cascade. MST1/2 (Hpo in Drosophila) with the adaptor SAV1 phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 (Warts in Drosophila) with the adaptor MOB1. LATS1/2 phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif). The pathway integrates mechanical cues (cell contact, matrix stiffness), cell polarity, and metabolic signals. S2 is TRUE: LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP at Ser127 (and other sites), creating a 14-3-3 binding site that sequesters YAP in the cytoplasm, preventing nuclear entry. LATS also phosphorylates YAP at Ser381, priming it for CK1delta/epsilon phosphorylation, which creates a phosphodegron recognized by SCF-beta-TrCP E3 ligase for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus active Hippo pathway = YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic + degraded = growth suppression. S3 is TRUE: When Hippo signaling is reduced (low cell density, mechanical tension from stiff substrate, growth factor signaling), unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ accumulates in the nucleus. YAP/TAZ binds TEAD1-4 transcription factors, which provide DNA-binding specificity. The YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex activates target genes including CTGF, CYR61, BIRC5, and cell cycle genes, promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. S4 is FALSE: YAP and TAZ are transcriptional CO-ACTIVATORS, NOT transcription factors. They lack DNA-binding domains and cannot directly bind DNA. They function by binding partner transcription factors, primarily TEAD1-4, but also SMADs, RUNXs, and p73, which provide DNA-binding specificity. This coactivator function means YAP/TAZ's transcriptional output depends on which partner transcription factors are available in a given cell type.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This genetic dependency data reveals KRAS as the oncogenic driver in this cell line. KRAS knockout reduces viability to 5% — indicating the cells are 'addicted' to KRAS signaling for survival (oncogene addiction). EGFR knockout has almost no effect (90% viability), demonstrating that the Ras activity driving proliferation and survival does NOT depend on EGFR-mediated activation. This pattern is characteristic of KRAS-mutant cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer with KRAS G12D, or colorectal cancer with KRAS G12V), where the mutation locks Ras in the GTP-bound state regardless of receptor status. This explains the clinical observation that EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib) are ineffective in KRAS-mutant cancers — blocking the receptor cannot suppress a constitutively active downstream Ras. The differential sensitivity of downstream nodes (BRAF 85%, MEK 60%, ERK 40%) suggests pathway redundancy: BRAF loss has minimal effect because CRAF compensates, while ERK (the final kinase) loss is more severe. The partial PI3K dependency (80%) indicates KRAS also feeds through the PI3K/Akt arm, consistent with Ras directly binding and activating PI3K-p110alpha.",

Key parallels: (1) Individual Ca2+ spikes have relatively constant amplitude (~400 nM peak), similar to action potentials having constant amplitude (~100 mV). This 'all-or-none' spike character arises from the regenerative positive feedback of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) through IP3 receptors, analogous to the regenerative Na+ current in action potentials. (2) Signal intensity (vasopressin concentration) is encoded in spike FREQUENCY, not amplitude: 2 nM → 2-3 spikes/min, 10 nM → 6-8 spikes/min. Similarly, neurons encode stimulus strength in firing frequency (5-200 Hz). (3) At very high stimulation, the system transitions to a sustained plateau (analogous to depolarization block in neurons). The biological advantage of frequency coding: (a) it prevents sustained high Ca2+ (which would trigger apoptosis); (b) it provides a wider dynamic range; (c) different frequencies can activate different downstream decoders (e.g., calcineurin/NFAT responds to sustained signals, while CaMKII responds to high-frequency pulses).

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Biased agonism (also called functional selectivity or ligand-directed trafficking) is evaluated by comparing a drug's activity across multiple signaling endpoints versus a reference balanced agonist. The approach: (1) G protein pathway assays: measure cAMP accumulation (for Gs/Gi-coupled receptors), calcium mobilization or IP1 accumulation (for Gq-coupled), or direct G protein activation using BRET sensors (Galpha-RLuc/Gbeta-GFP). Generate full dose-response curves (EC50 and Emax). (2) Beta-arrestin pathway assays: measure beta-arrestin recruitment to the receptor using BRET (receptor-RLuc + beta-arrestin-GFP), PathHunter enzyme fragment complementation, or Tango assays. Generate dose-response curves. (3) Calculate 'bias factors' using the operational model (Black and Leff): compare the transduction coefficient [log(tau/KA)] for each pathway for the test drug versus reference agonist. A bias factor significantly different from 1 indicates biased agonism. For example, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) agonist TRV027 is beta-arrestin-biased: it recruits beta-arrestin but poorly activates Gq, producing beneficial cardiovascular effects (cardioprotection) without Gq-mediated vasoconstriction.

Two primary binding motifs have been identified: mode 1 (RSXpSXP) and mode 2 (RXXXpSXP). 14-3-3 binding typically results in: (1) Cytoplasmic sequestration: 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated Bad (by Akt) sequesters Bad in the cytoplasm, preventing mitochondrial apoptosis; 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated YAP keeps it out of the nucleus (Hippo pathway). (2) Conformational modulation: 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated Raf can either activate or inhibit its kinase activity depending on which phosphosites are occupied.

DUBs play critical roles in signal transduction: (1) Signal termination: CYLD (a tumor suppressor DUB) removes K63-linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF2 and NEMO/IKKgamma, terminating NF-kappaB signaling. Loss of CYLD leads to constitutive NF-kappaB activation (familial cylindromatosis). (2) Receptor recycling: USP8 deubiquitinates internalized EGFR, promoting its recycling to the plasma membrane rather than lysosomal degradation, sustaining receptor signaling.

      "explanation": "Integrins are heterodimeric (alpha-beta) transmembrane receptors that connect the ECM to the intracellular cytoskeleton and signaling machinery. Their unique feature is bidirectional signaling: Outside-in signaling: ECM ligand binding (fibronectin, collagen, laminin) to the extracellular domain triggers integrin clustering and conformational activation. This recruits focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which autophosphorylates at Y397, creating a binding site for Src SH2 domain. The FAK-Src complex phosphorylates numerous substrates, activating Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Rho GTPase pathways. Talin and kindlin bind integrin beta-tails, linking to the actin cytoskeleton via vinculin. These signals regulate cell survival (anoikis prevention), proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Inside-out signaling: Intracellular signals (from chemokine receptors, TCR, or other pathways) activate talin, which binds the integrin beta cytoplasmic tail and separates the alpha-beta transmembrane domains, triggering a conformational change that propagates to the extracellular domain, switching integrins from low-affinity (bent) to high-affinity (extended-open) conformation.

Ceramide activates PP2A (dephosphorylating Akt), cathepsin D, and mitochondrial channels, promoting apoptosis. Stress signals (UV, chemotherapy, TNF) increase ceramide. (2) Sphingosine: generated from ceramide by ceramidase. Sphingosine inhibits PKC and promotes apoptosis. (3) Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P): generated from sphingosine by sphingosine kinase (SphK1/2). S1P signals through five GPCRs (S1PR1-5) to activate survival pathways (PI3K/Akt, ERK), promote cell migration, and regulate immune cell trafficking. Growth factor signaling activates SphK1, shifting the balance toward S1P. The enzyme sphingosine kinase controls this conversion and is considered oncogenic (SphK1 overexpression promotes tumor growth). FTY720 (fingolimod), an S1P receptor modulator, is used for multiple sclerosis treatment.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is a fundamental distinction in receptor biology. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, e.g., EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR) are single-pass transmembrane proteins with an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain encoded as part of the receptor polypeptide. Ligand-induced dimerization brings two kinase domains together for trans-autophosphorylation. Cytokine receptors (type I: receptors for IL-2, IL-6, GM-CSF, GH, erythropoietin; type II: receptors for interferons, IL-10) also respond to ligand-induced dimerization/multimerization, but they LACK any catalytic domain. Instead, they constitutively associate with JAK family tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) through their cytoplasmic Box1/Box2 motifs. When the receptor dimerizes, the pre-associated JAKs are brought into proximity, trans-phosphorylate each other (activating), and then phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic tails. These phosphotyrosines recruit STAT transcription factors via SH2 domains. Despite the mechanistic similarity (both result in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor), the architectural distinction — intrinsic vs. associated kinase — defines different receptor superfamilies with different evolutionary origins and regulatory properties.",

      "explanation": "Patched (PTCH1) is the receptor for Hedgehog ligands and also the primary negative regulator of the pathway. In its unliganded state, Ptch constitutively inhibits Smoothened (Smo), keeping the pathway OFF. Loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 eliminate this inhibition, causing constitutive Smoothened activation and ligand-independent pathway signaling: Gli transcription factors (particularly Gli2A) accumulate in the nucleus and activate target genes including PTCH1 itself (which cannot provide negative feedback if both alleles are lost), GLI1, CCND1 (cyclin D1), MYC, and BCL2. This drives uncontrolled proliferation and survival. Clinically: (1) Gorlin syndrome (basal cell nevus syndrome): autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline PTCH1 mutations; patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas at young ages, medulloblastomas, and skeletal abnormalities. (2) Sporadic basal cell carcinoma: ~90% have somatic PTCH1 mutations or Smo activating mutations. (3) ~30% of sporadic medulloblastomas have Hh pathway mutations. The FDA-approved drug vismodegib (GDC-0449) inhibits Smoothened and is used to treat advanced basal cell carcinoma, validating the pathway as a therapeutic target.",

Exosomes are taken up by recipient cells via membrane fusion, endocytosis, or receptor-mediated uptake.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular damage signals that induce BH3-only proteins: DNA damage → p53 → Puma/Noxa; growth factor withdrawal → Bim/Bad (dephosphorylated); ER stress → Bim/Puma. BH3-only proteins activate Bax/Bak, which oligomerize in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), forming large pores (MOMP). This releases intermembrane space proteins including cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and Omi/HtrA2 into the cytoplasm. S2 is TRUE: Released cytochrome c binds Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1), inducing its oligomerization into a wheel-shaped heptameric complex — the apoptosome (~1.4 MDa). The apoptosome recruits and activates procaspase-9 by induced proximity, generating active caspase-9. Caspase-9 then cleaves and activates the executioner caspases-3 and -7, which cleave hundreds of cellular substrates (PARP, ICAD, lamin A) to execute apoptosis. S3 is FALSE: The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways CROSS-TALK. The key connection is Bid (a BH3-only protein): caspase-8 (from the extrinsic DISC) cleaves Bid to tBid, which activates Bax/Bak and triggers MOMP. In 'type II' cells (hepatocytes), this amplification loop through mitochondria is essential for death receptor-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2 overexpression blocks apoptosis in type II cells (by blocking MOMP) but not type I cells (which have sufficient DISC-generated caspase-8). S4 is TRUE: IAPs (XIAP is the most potent) contain BIR domains that directly bind and inhibit caspase-3, -7, and -9. Smac/DIABLO (released from mitochondria during MOMP) contains an AVPI tetrapeptide motif that competes with caspases for IAP BIR domain binding, relieving IAP inhibition. This dual safety mechanism (apoptosome activation + IAP neutralization) ensures robust caspase activation. Smac-mimetic drugs (birinapant, LCL-161) are being developed as cancer therapeutics.",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Notch signaling is the prototypical juxtacrine (contact-dependent) pathway. Both the receptor (Notch 1-4) and ligands (Delta-like 1/3/4, Jagged 1/2) are single-pass transmembrane proteins, requiring direct cell-cell contact for activation. This proximity requirement restricts Notch signaling to adjacent cells, enabling pattern formation through lateral inhibition. S2 is TRUE: Trans-endocytosis of the extracellular domain of Notch bound to Delta by the signal-sending cell generates a mechanical pulling force (~12 pN) that unfolds the Notch negative regulatory region (NRR), exposing the ADAM10/TACE S2 cleavage site. Without this force, the NRR normally conceals the cleavage site, preventing ligand-independent activation. This mechanosensitive gating ensures that Notch is only activated by membrane-bound ligands on adjacent cells (trans-activation) and not by soluble ligands. S3 is FALSE: While gamma-secretase does cleave Notch at S3 releasing NICD, the NICD does NOT directly bind DNA. NICD enters the nucleus and binds the transcription factor CSL (CBF1/RBPjkappa/Su(H)/Lag-1), which provides the DNA-binding specificity. NICD converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor (associated with co-repressor complexes) to an activator by displacing co-repressors and recruiting co-activators (Mastermind/MAML, p300). S4 is FALSE: Notch signaling is notably NOT an amplification cascade. It lacks enzymatic amplification: one receptor activation releases one NICD molecule, which forms one transcriptional complex. There is no kinase cascade or second messenger amplification. This 'one signal, one response' stoichiometry makes Notch signaling relatively low-gain, requiring multiple Notch-Delta interactions for robust responses. Signal intensity is controlled by receptor/ligand levels and post-translational modifications (Fringe glycosylation of Notch modulates ligand specificity).",

      "explanation": "This optogenetic experiment reveals the MAPK cascade's temporal filtering properties. The cascade acts as a low-pass filter/temporal integrator: (1) Each pulse of Ras activity initiates a wave of phosphorylation through Raf → MEK → ERK. (2) Dephosphorylation at each tier has finite kinetics (determined by phosphatase activity): Raf deactivation (minutes), MEK dephosphorylation (minutes), ERK dephosphorylation (~5-10 min). (3) If the interval between pulses is shorter than the deactivation time, the next pulse arrives before complete deactivation, maintaining a 'floor' of activity — similar to temporal summation in neurons. (4) The resulting time-averaged ERK output is approximately proportional to the 'duty cycle' (fraction of time Ras is ON): continuous (100%) = high, 1/5 (20%) = moderate, 1/10 (10%) = low. (5) A single pulse (rows 4-5) fully deactivates by 30 min, confirming the system has no permanent 'memory' but does have finite relaxation kinetics. This experiment demonstrates that the MAPK cascade's multi-tiered architecture provides not only amplification but also temporal signal processing — converting digital (on-off) Ras pulses into an analog (graded) ERK output.

(2) IKK activity is reduced → drug blocks IKK activation, not a downstream step. (3) IkappaBalpha degradation and p65 nuclear translocation are blocked → consistent with IKK inhibition (IKK phosphorylates IkappaBalpha for degradation). (4) CRITICAL: Constitutively active IKK (IKK-CA, which bypasses all upstream activation steps) fully activates the NF-kappaB reporter even in the presence of the drug (25-fold, same as without drug). This means the drug does NOT directly inhibit IKK catalytic activity — if it did, IKK-CA would also be blocked. Instead, the drug must block an upstream step required for IKK activation. (5) Since TNF-R1 is normal but IKK is not activated, the drug likely targets a signaling intermediate between TNF-R1 and IKK: candidates include TRADD (adaptor), TRAF2 (E3 ligase for K63-Ub), RIP1/RIPK1 (kinase/scaffold), or TAK1 (the MAP3K that directly phosphorylates IKK).

The key comparison: rapamycin (which specifically inhibits mTORC1 by disrupting Raptor-mTOR interaction) does NOT reduce pAkt-Ser473, demonstrating mTORC1 is not the relevant kinase. Torin1 (an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor that blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2) DOES eliminate pAkt-Ser473, implicating mTOR catalytic activity in pAkt. Since the difference between rapamycin and Torin1 is mTORC2 inhibition, mTORC2 must be the Ser473 kinase. This is consistent with genetic evidence: Rictor (an mTORC2-specific component) knockout abolishes Akt Ser473 phosphorylation. The wortmannin control confirms PI3K is required upstream (for PIP3-mediated Akt membrane recruitment). MK-2206 confirms Akt identity. Interestingly, prolonged rapamycin treatment (days, not hours) CAN reduce pAkt in some cell types because it prevents new mTORC2 assembly (mTOR is shared between both complexes), but acute rapamycin treatment (as shown here) spares pre-formed mTORC2. This distinction has clinical implications: Torin1-type catalytic mTOR inhibitors may be more effective anti-cancer agents than rapamycin because they block both mTORC1 (cell growth) and mTORC2 (cell survival via Akt).",

While all three modifications activate CREB's interaction with CBP/p300, additional pathway-specific modifications on CREB's regulatory domains can modulate which co-factors are recruited and which genes are ultimately activated. The experimental approach: (1) Stimulate Pathway A or Pathway B separately; (2) Immunoprecipitate TF-X; (3) Analyze by LC-MS/MS to identify all modified residues; (4) Use site-directed mutagenesis (Ser→Ala for each phosphosite) to determine which modifications are essential for each pathway's transcriptional output; (5) Use phospho-specific antibodies to monitor pathway-specific modifications in real-time.

(2) Fuse the N-terminal half to a domain that responds to Signal A (e.g., a rapamycin-inducible FKBP domain).

Early responders (1 min peak): EGFR autophosphorylation is the initiating event (maximal at 1 min, then declines due to phosphatase activity, receptor internalization, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation). Shc is a direct EGFR substrate (binds pTyr via PTB domain), so its phosphorylation closely tracks EGFR activation. Intermediate responders (5 min peak): ERK peaks at 5 min, consistent with the time needed for the multi-step Grb2→SOS→Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK cascade (each enzymatic step adds ~30-60 seconds). Gab1 peaks at 5 min because it requires initial EGFR-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of additional signaling molecules (PI3K, SHP2).

The sequential decline of all proteins reflects the collective action of phosphatases (PTP1B, SHP1, PP2A), receptor downregulation (Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation), and negative feedback (MAPK phosphatases, Sprouty). This temporal analysis is a powerful tool for understanding pathway architecture and identifying rate-limiting steps.",

        "Import of proteins bearing a nuclear localization signal into the nucleus",
        "Secretion of extracellular matrix glycoproteins",
        "Lysosomal enzyme targeting via mannose-6-phosphate tagging",
        "Insertion of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins into the plasma membrane"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Nuclear import relies on importin-mediated transport through nuclear pore complexes and does not require the endomembrane system or vesicle trafficking. Brefeldin A disrupts COPI-dependent retrograde transport, causing Golgi collapse into the ER, which blocks secretory pathway function. This would severely impair secretion (A), plasma membrane protein delivery (B), and M6P tagging of lysosomal enzymes in the cis-Golgi (D). Nuclear import is completely independent of the Golgi apparatus.",

      "options": [
        "It triggers fusion of the endosome with the trans-Golgi network",
        "It denatures the apolipoprotein B-100 coat of the LDL particle",
        "It causes dissociation of LDL from the LDL receptor, allowing receptor recycling",
        "It activates lysosomal hydrolases to begin digesting the LDL particle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The mild acidification of early endosomes (pH ~6.0) causes a conformational change in the LDL receptor that releases the bound LDL ligand. This is critical because it allows the receptor to be recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes, while the LDL cargo continues to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. Lysosomal hydrolases require pH ~4.5-5.0 and are not yet fully active at pH 6.0 (A). The endosome does not fuse with the TGN in the LDL pathway (C). While apoB-100 may undergo some conformational change, denaturation is not the primary functional consequence (D).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "While all options support endosymbiotic theory, the strongest evidence comes from molecular phylogenetics. Mitochondrial DNA is circular (like bacteria), uses bacterial-type DNA polymerase and replication machinery, and sequence analysis of mitochondrial rRNA genes places them firmly within the alphaproteobacterial clade (closest to Rickettsia). This provides direct evolutionary evidence of ancestry. Double membranes (A) and binary fission (C) are consistent with but not unique proof of endosymbiosis. Cardiolipin presence (D) is supportive but not as phylogenetically informative as DNA sequence analysis.",

        "Nuclear lamina integrity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Microtubules are dynamic polymers that undergo continuous turnover even during interphase. Colchicine prevents new polymerization, so existing microtubules gradually depolymerize without replacement. This disrupts the microtubule network responsible for maintaining cell shape (as part of the cytoskeleton) and intracellular transport (kinesin and dynein motor proteins move vesicles along microtubule tracks). The nuclear lamina (A) is composed of intermediate filaments (lamins), not microtubules. The contractile ring (C) is made of actin and myosin II. Adherens junctions (D) are linked to actin filaments via catenins, not to microtubules.",

        "Proteins destined for the Golgi would be retained in the ER lumen"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The KDEL receptor system is a retrieval mechanism: ER-resident soluble proteins (like chaperones BiP/GRP78, PDI, calreticulin) that accidentally escape to the Golgi are recognized by KDEL receptors in the cis-Golgi and returned to the ER via COPI retrograde vesicles. If the KDEL receptor is non-functional, these proteins would not be retrieved and would continue through the secretory pathway to be secreted by default. COPII budding (C) is not dependent on KDEL recognition. Golgi-destined proteins use different sorting signals (B). Lysosomal enzymes use M6P signals, not KDEL (D).",

      "options": [
        "It requires ATP hydrolysis to function, making it an active energy-consuming process",
        "It indirectly drives secondary active transport of glucose and amino acids",
        "It creates concentration gradients of both Na+ and K+ across the membrane",
        "It generates a net movement of positive charge outward, directly contributing to the membrane potential"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "An electrogenic pump is one that generates an electrical current (net charge movement) across the membrane. The Na+/K+ ATPase moves 3 positive charges out for every 2 positive charges in, resulting in a net export of one positive charge per cycle. This directly contributes approximately -10 mV to the resting membrane potential (which is typically around -70 mV in neurons). While it does require ATP (A), create concentration gradients (C), and drive secondary transport (D), none of these properties define it as electrogenic. The defining feature is the unequal charge transfer.",

      "options": [
        "Fluidity first increases then decreases in a biphasic response",
        "Fluidity decreases because cholesterol restrains movement of unsaturated phospholipids while having minimal additional effect on already-ordered saturated lipids",
        "Fluidity decreases continuously because cholesterol immobilizes all phospholipid tails",
        "Fluidity increases continuously because cholesterol disrupts phospholipid packing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "At physiological temperature (above the phase transition temperature of most membrane lipids), the membrane is already in a fluid state. Cholesterol's rigid steroid ring intercalates between phospholipid tails and restrains their movement, reducing fluidity. This effect is most pronounced on unsaturated phospholipids, which are highly disordered due to their kinked tails. Saturated phospholipids are already relatively ordered, so cholesterol has less additional restraining effect on them. The net result at 37°C is a decrease in overall fluidity. At temperatures below the phase transition, cholesterol would actually increase fluidity by disrupting tight packing, but the question specifies physiological temperature.",

      "options": [
        "Dynein is powered by GTP hydrolysis while kinesin uses ATP hydrolysis",
        "Their motor domains have different ATP hydrolysis cycle conformational changes that produce force toward opposite ends of the microtubule",
        "They bind to different protofilaments within the microtubule wall",
        "They require different adaptor proteins that determine the direction of movement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) moves toward the plus end of microtubules, while cytoplasmic dynein moves toward the minus end. This directionality is intrinsic to the motor domain structure of each protein. The conformational changes associated with ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP/Pi release produce a power stroke in the motor head that steps toward the plus end for kinesin and toward the minus end for dynein. Both use ATP (not GTP) as their energy source (C is wrong). They can bind the same protofilaments (A is wrong). While adaptor proteins regulate cargo binding, they do not determine intrinsic motor directionality (D is wrong).",

      "options": [
        "Both ΨP and ΨS increase as the cell equilibrates with the external solution",
        "ΨP decreases to zero and ΨS becomes more negative as the cell loses water",
        "ΨP increases and ΨS becomes less negative as solutes are diluted",
        "ΨP decreases to zero while ΨS remains constant because solute amount is unchanged"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "In a hypertonic solution, water exits the cell by osmosis. As the cell loses water, the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall (plasmolysis). Turgor pressure drops to zero once the membrane detaches from the wall. Simultaneously, as water leaves, the intracellular solute concentration increases (same amount of solute in less volume), making ΨS more negative. Option C is incorrect because while the total amount of solute doesn't change, ΨS depends on concentration (molarity), which increases as volume decreases. The water potential equation is Ψ = ΨP + ΨS, and at full plasmolysis, Ψ = 0 + ΨS.",

        "The cells form tight junctions instead as a compensatory mechanism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Gap junction formation requires compatible connexin isoforms. Connexin-43 (Cx43) and connexin-32 (Cx32) are incompatible for heterotypic gap junction formation — their extracellular loops cannot dock properly. Connexin compatibility is determined by specific interactions between the two extracellular loops (E1 and E2) of adjacent connexons. While some connexin combinations can form heterotypic channels (e.g., Cx43-Cx37), Cx43-Cx32 is a well-characterized incompatible pair. Undocked hemichannels are normally kept closed by Ca2+ and voltage gating, so unregulated leakage (C) does not occur.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Tight junctions (zonula occludens) form a continuous belt around the apical end of epithelial cells where claudin and occludin proteins create a seal between adjacent cells. Critically, this seal also acts as a 'fence' within the membrane itself, preventing lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins between the apical and basolateral domains. This maintains membrane polarity essential for vectorial transport (e.g., glucose absorption). Desmosomes (A) provide mechanical strength but do not form a continuous diffusion barrier. The glycocalyx (C) is extracellular and doesn't restrict lateral diffusion within the membrane. The actin cytoskeleton (D) can restrict protein mobility but is not the primary determinant of domain separation.",

        "Both cell types synthesize large quantities of secretory proteins requiring folding",
        "Both cell types perform glycogen synthesis, which occurs exclusively in the smooth ER"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis, steroid hormone production, and detoxification. Adrenal cortex cells produce steroid hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, androgens) from cholesterol, requiring extensive smooth ER for the enzymatic machinery of steroidogenesis. Hepatocytes have abundant smooth ER for detoxification reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which metabolize drugs, toxins, and endogenous substrates. While hepatocytes also store glycogen, glycogen synthesis enzymes are cytoplasmic (glycogen synthase is cytosolic), not exclusively smooth ER-localized (D is wrong). Secretory protein folding occurs in the rough ER (A is wrong). Calcium storage in sarcoplasmic reticulum is specific to muscle cells (C is wrong).",

        "A gating mechanism controlled by intracellular pH that closes the channel when proton concentration rises"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Aquaporins must allow water but block protons to maintain the proton-motive force across membranes. The two conserved NPA motifs located at the center of the channel create an electrostatic barrier and reorient water molecules passing through the pore. As water molecules pass the NPA region, their dipole orientation is flipped, breaking the continuous hydrogen-bond chain that would otherwise allow proton hopping (Grotthuss mechanism). Additionally, an aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter near the extracellular end provides a size restriction. However, the NPA motifs are the PRIMARY mechanism for proton exclusion specifically.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Intermediate filaments (IFs) are fundamentally different from actin filaments and microtubules. IFs are non-polar because their subunits assemble in an antiparallel fashion, meaning there is no structural distinction between the two ends. They do not bind ATP or GTP and lack intrinsic enzymatic activity. Consequently, no motor proteins travel along IFs (unlike kinesin/dynein on microtubules or myosin on actin). This makes them purely structural, providing mechanical strength. Option A is wrong because IFs are non-polar. Option C describes microtubule behavior. Option D is wrong because IFs are diverse: keratins in epithelial cells, vimentin in mesenchymal cells, neurofilaments in neurons, desmin in muscle, and lamins in the nucleus.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In mammalian mitochondria, the total proton motive force (Δp) is approximately 180-220 mV. Of this, the membrane potential (Δψ) contributes about 150-180 mV (~75-80%), while the pH gradient (ΔpH, approximately 0.5-1.0 pH units, equivalent to ~30-60 mV) contributes the remaining ~20-25%. This is in contrast to chloroplasts, where the situation is reversed: the thylakoid lumen becomes very acidic (pH ~5 vs stroma pH ~8), so ΔpH dominates. The large Δψ in mitochondria is maintained by the electrogenic nature of proton pumping by Complexes I, III, and IV.

      "explanation": "Cytochalasin D caps the barbed (plus) end of actin filaments, preventing new monomer addition. However, existing actin filaments in the cortex are stabilized by various actin-binding proteins including tropomyosin, cortexillin, and capping proteins that reduce the rate of depolymerization. The cortical actin network also has relatively slow turnover compared to the highly dynamic lamellipodia at the leading edge. Cell migration requires rapid actin polymerization at the leading edge (which is immediately blocked), but the structural cortex persists for some time. Cytochalasin D affects all cytoplasmic actin (B is wrong). Neither intermediate filaments (C) nor microtubules (D) can functionally replace the actin cortex.",

        "Glucose uptake is unaffected because SGLT1 uses its own energy source"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "SGLT1 is a secondary active transporter that harnesses the Na+ electrochemical gradient (high Na+ outside, low inside) to drive glucose uptake against its concentration gradient. This Na+ gradient is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase. When ouabain inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase, Na+ that enters the cell via SGLT1 and other channels is no longer pumped out. Intracellular Na+ gradually rises, reducing the driving force for SGLT1. The effect is gradual (not immediate) because the existing Na+ gradient takes time to dissipate. Eventually, glucose uptake via SGLT1 would cease entirely. This demonstrates the dependence of secondary active transport on primary active transport.",

It recognizes the hydrophobic signal peptide as it emerges from the ribosome, pauses translation, and docks the ribosome-nascent chain complex at the SRP receptor on the rough ER. The nascent chain is then threaded through the Sec61 translocon into the ER lumen. Without SRP, ribosomes synthesizing secretory and membrane proteins would remain free in the cytosol, completing translation and releasing mislocalized proteins into the cytoplasm.

Upon membrane depolarization reaching threshold, the activation gate rapidly opens (channel is now Open, both gates open), allowing Na+ influx. Within milliseconds, the inactivation gate (a cytoplasmic loop acting as a 'ball-and-chain') swings into the channel pore, blocking it (Inactivated state — activation gate open, inactivation gate closed). The channel cannot reopen from this inactivated state, which is the basis of the absolute refractory period.

S2: TRUE — Unlike processive motors like myosin V (which takes many steps per binding event), myosin II detaches after each power stroke. It works effectively only in large arrays (e.g., sarcomere thick filaments, contractile ring) where many heads generate force simultaneously. S3: FALSE — Kinesin-13 (also called MCAK, Mitotic Centromere-Associated Kinesin) is NOT a transport motor. It is a microtubule depolymerase that uses ATP hydrolysis energy to induce curved protofilament conformations at microtubule ends, promoting catastrophe. It is crucial during mitosis for correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

It is stored in intracellular vesicles and translocates to the plasma membrane only in response to insulin signaling (via the PI3K/Akt pathway triggering vesicle fusion). This is why insulin deficiency causes hyperglycemia. S2: TRUE — Plant cells use a primary H+-ATPase to pump protons out, creating an electrochemical gradient. The H+/sucrose symporter then uses the proton gradient to co-transport sucrose into the cell. This is classic secondary active transport. S3: FALSE — Channel proteins can show saturation-like kinetics at very high flux rates due to ion-ion interactions within the pore and limited conductance. However, more importantly, the statement confuses channels with simple diffusion. Carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion definitely shows saturation (Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Some channels show near-linear flux, but the absolute statement 'without ever reaching saturation' is incorrect.

The resulting kinks prevent tight packing, maintaining membrane fluidity at lower temperatures. This is a well-known homeoviscous adaptation. S2: TRUE — Lipid rafts are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains. Sphingomyelin's saturated acyl chains pack tightly with cholesterol's flat steroid ring, forming a liquid-ordered (Lo) phase that is less fluid and thicker than the surrounding liquid-disordered (Ld) phase.

S2: FALSE — Tight junctions (zonula occludens) are composed of claudins, occludin, and JAM (junctional adhesion molecule) proteins, NOT cadherins. E-cadherin is the primary adhesion molecule of adherens junctions, not tight junctions. ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 are scaffolding proteins associated with tight junctions.

Sugars (beginning with N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc) are added sequentially to Ser/Thr residues. There is no dolichol intermediate. S3: TRUE — The Golgi has a clear enzymatic polarity. Cis cisternae contain mannosidase I and II (trimming mannose residues). Medial cisternae have GlcNAc transferases. Trans cisternae and TGN have galactosyltransferases and sialyltransferases.

For K+ this is approximately -90 mV, for Na+ approximately +60 mV, and for Cl- approximately -80 mV. S2: TRUE — At -70 mV, the Na+ concentration gradient (high outside ~145 mM, low inside ~15 mM) drives Na+ inward. The electrical gradient also drives Na+ inward because the inside is negative, attracting positive charges. Both forces are in the same direction, creating a large electrochemical driving force for Na+ entry. S3: TRUE — The GHK equation (also called the Goldman equation) extends the Nernst equation by incorporating the relative membrane permeabilities (P) and concentrations of K+, Na+, and Cl-. At rest, PK >> PNa, so the resting potential is close to EK. S4: FALSE — Increasing extracellular K+ concentration would DEPOLARIZE (not hyperpolarize) the membrane.

This leads to accumulation of undigested substrates (inclusion bodies visible in fibroblasts). S2: TRUE — Macroautophagy begins with formation of a phagophore (isolation membrane) that expands and seals to form a double-membraned autophagosome. This then fuses with lysosomes (forming an autolysosome) where the inner membrane and enclosed contents are degraded. Key regulators include ATG proteins, mTOR, and AMPK.

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Unlike mitochondria and chloroplasts, peroxisomes can import fully folded and even oligomeric proteins. The Pex5 receptor recognizes the PTS1 signal (most commonly the C-terminal tripeptide Ser-Lys-Leu, SKL) and delivers cargo through a transient pore formed by Pex proteins. There is also a PTS2 signal recognized by Pex7. S2: FALSE — Peroxisomes are NOT part of the endomembrane system. While recent evidence shows that some peroxisomal membrane proteins transit through the ER, peroxisomes primarily grow and divide autonomously. They are not connected to the ER-Golgi secretory pathway in the way lysosomes are. S3: TRUE — Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) cannot enter mitochondria directly. They are first shortened in peroxisomes by beta-oxidation to medium-chain products (e.g., octanoyl-CoA), which are then transferred to mitochondria for complete oxidation. Defects in peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. S4: TRUE — Oxidases in peroxisomes generate H2O2 as a byproduct. Catalase (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2) and other peroxidases rapidly decompose H2O2, preventing oxidative damage. Catalase is a hallmark peroxisomal enzyme.",

Ligand binding induces a conformational change that promotes exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit, dissociating Gα-GTP from Gβγ, both of which activate downstream effectors. S2: TRUE — RTK activation requires ligand-induced dimerization (or oligomerization). The juxtaposed kinase domains then phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosine residues (trans-autophosphorylation). These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for SH2 and PTB domain-containing signaling proteins (e.g., Grb2, PLCγ, PI3K). S3: TRUE — PIP2 cleavage by PLCβ (downstream of GPCRs) or PLCγ (downstream of RTKs) generates IP3 and DAG simultaneously. IP3 is soluble and diffuses to ER IP3 receptors to trigger Ca2+ release. DAG remains membrane-associated and recruits/activates PKC. This is a key branching point in signaling. S4: FALSE — Lipid rafts play important roles in signal transduction.

The MICOS (Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System) complex maintains cristae junctions, while OPA1 (a dynamin-related GTPase) regulates cristae remodeling. Defects in OPA1 cause dominant optic atrophy. S2: TRUE — UCP1 (thermogenin) creates a regulated proton leak pathway in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown fat cells. This dissipates the proton gradient as heat rather than coupling it to ATP synthesis. UCP1 is activated by free fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides (GDP, GTP). S3: TRUE — In chloroplasts, the thylakoid lumen becomes very acidic during illumination (pH drops from ~7 to ~4, a ΔpH of ~3). The membrane potential contribution is small (~30 mV) because ion channels rapidly equilibrate charge. This contrasts with mitochondria where Δψ (~150-180 mV) dominates over ΔpH (~0.5-1 unit). S4: TRUE — ATP synthase (F0F1 complex) uses rotary catalysis. The Fo domain (in the membrane) contains the c-ring that rotates as protons flow through.

This increases water reabsorption. Mutations in AQP2 or V2R cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. S2: FALSE — While aquaporins dramatically increase water permeability (up to 3 billion water molecules per second per channel), water can still permeate slowly through the lipid bilayer itself via the solubility-diffusion mechanism. The intrinsic permeability of a pure lipid bilayer to water is low but non-zero. S3: TRUE — HgCl2 was historically used to demonstrate aquaporin function. Hg2+ binds to Cys-189 near the NPA motif of AQP1, blocking the channel. Mercury-sensitive water transport became a hallmark of aquaporin-mediated flux. This was a key experiment by Peter Agre.

Centrioles recruit and organize PCM components. S2: TRUE — Dynamic instability was described by Mitchison and Kirschner (1984). GTP-tubulin adds to the plus end; after incorporation, GTP on β-tubulin is hydrolyzed to GDP. If hydrolysis catches up to the growing end (loss of the GTP cap), the microtubule undergoes catastrophe (rapid depolymerization). Rescue is the reverse switch. S3: FALSE — Taxol does the OPPOSITE: it STABILIZES microtubules by binding within the lumen and preventing depolymerization. This is lethal to dividing cells because mitotic spindle dynamics require both polymerization and depolymerization for proper chromosome segregation. Taxol-treated cells arrest in mitosis.

This anomaly is well documented and attributed to water's small size allowing it to permeate through transient packing defects in the bilayer (and in vivo, through aquaporins). Option A is wrong because molecular weight alone doesn't explain it — water (MW 18) has lower Kp than O2 (MW 32) but higher permeability than predicted by Kp alone. Option C ignores the critical role of charge: Na+ is impermeable primarily because moving an ion through the hydrophobic bilayer interior has an enormous Born energy penalty.

The small variations (41-44) are within experimental noise. Condition 2 shows zero uptake when glucose concentrations are equal on both sides, confirming that GLUT1 requires a glucose concentration gradient (net flux = 0 at equilibrium). Conditions 5 and 6 show near-saturation kinetics at higher glucose, consistent with carrier-mediated transport (Km of GLUT1 ≈ 1-2 mM, so 5 mM is already approaching Vmax).

The spectrin-ankyrin meshwork underlying the plasma membrane creates 'corral fences' that restrict lateral diffusion of transmembrane proteins.

For comparison: Solution A is isotonic (effective osmolarity = 300 mOsm). Solution B has 300 mOsm total but σ = 0, so effective osmolarity = 0 — it is effectively hypotonic, causing lysis. Solution D has effective osmolarity = (1.0 × 400) + (0 × 100) = 400 mOsm for NaCl only, so it is also hypertonic. This question tests the critical distinction between osmolarity and tonicity.",

The fact that lysosomal enzymes have normal activity when tested in lysates (with exogenous substrate at acidic pH) rules out enzyme deficiency and pH problems (D). Normal M6P receptor expression and Golgi morphology rule out I-cell disease (A). Normal endocytosis timing rules out clathrin defects (C). The enlarged Rab7+ structures without LAMP1 co-localization specifically point to a fusion defect — the late endosomes cannot merge with lysosomes (which carry LAMP1). Possible molecular defects include mutations in HOPS complex subunits, Rab7 effectors, or SNARE proteins required for this fusion event.",

Removing this barrier allows more vesicles to fuse. Condition 4 (nocodazole alone) dramatically DECREASES fusion from 45 to 12, indicating that microtubules are essential for transporting vesicles from the cell interior to the cell periphery. Condition 5 (both drugs) shows very low fusion (8), because even though the actin barrier is removed, vesicles cannot reach the plasma membrane without microtubule transport. This is a well-established model in beta cell biology: kinesin moves insulin granules along microtubules toward the plasma membrane, but cortical actin acts as a final gatekeeper. Glucose stimulation triggers actin remodeling that permits vesicle docking and fusion.",

In single-molecule recordings, channels show characteristic discrete 'square wave' openings and closings (single-channel conductance steps) as individual pore proteins switch between open and closed states. Carriers, by contrast, undergo conformational changes to transport substrate (100-1000 per second) and would show smooth, averaged current without discrete steps. Option A is partially correct (channels are faster) but Vmax alone cannot definitively distinguish mechanism — a highly expressed carrier could have high total flux. Option B is incorrect because some channels also show saturation kinetics (e.g., ion channels at very high ion concentrations). Option D is wrong because both channels and carriers can be specifically inhibited (e.g., tetrodotoxin blocks Na+ channels).",

The SP-GFP construct directly tests sufficiency: if the 20-amino-acid peptide alone can redirect cytoplasmic GFP to the ER, this provides strong evidence that it functions as a bona fide signal peptide.

Electron microscopy (A) provides structural snapshots but cannot distinguish Golgi-derived vesicles from ER in fragmented mitotic membranes.

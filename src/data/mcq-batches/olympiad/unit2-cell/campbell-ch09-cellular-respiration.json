      "options": [
        "Only NAD+ and CoA are required for the complete reaction",
        "The reaction requires only thiamine pyrophosphate and water",
        "Only ATP and NADPH are needed because the reaction is anabolic",
        "Five cofactors are required: thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) for decarboxylation, lipoamide for acyl transfer and oxidation, CoA for acetyl group acceptance, FAD for reoxidation of dihydrolipoamide, and NAD+ as the terminal electron acceptor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a massive multi-enzyme complex (~10 MDa in eukaryotes) consisting of three catalytic components: E1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase/decarboxylase), E2 (dihydrolipoyl transacetylase), and E3 (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase). The reaction proceeds through five steps requiring five cofactors: (1) E1 uses thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP, derived from vitamin B1) to decarboxylate pyruvate, forming a hydroxyethyl-TPP intermediate. (2) The hydroxyethyl group is transferred to lipoamide (covalently attached to E2 via a lysine residue), oxidizing it to an acetyl-thioester while reducing the disulfide of lipoamide. (3) E2 transfers the acetyl group from lipoamide to coenzyme A (CoA, derived from pantothenic acid/vitamin B5), forming acetyl-CoA. (4) E3 reoxidizes dihydrolipoamide using FAD (derived from riboflavin/vitamin B2) as an electron acceptor. (5) FADH2 is reoxidized by NAD+ (derived from niacin/vitamin B3), producing NADH. The flexible lipoamide arm of E2 swings between all three active sites, acting as a substrate channel. This is NOT an anabolic reaction (C) — it is oxidative and catabolic. It requires all five cofactors, not just two (A, D).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) catalyzes the first oxidative decarboxylation in the TCA cycle: isocitrate + NAD+ → alpha-ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH. As one of the three primary regulatory enzymes of the TCA cycle (along with citrate synthase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), IDH is allosterically regulated by the cell's energy status. ADP is a positive allosteric activator — its accumulation signals that ATP has been consumed and more energy is needed, stimulating TCA cycle flux. NAD+ availability also promotes the reaction as a substrate. Conversely, ATP is an allosteric inhibitor — high ATP indicates energy sufficiency, slowing the cycle. NADH inhibits both as a product (mass action) and allosterically, signaling that the electron transport chain has sufficient reducing equivalents. In some tissues, Ca2+ also activates IDH (particularly the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent isoform IDH3), linking TCA cycle activity to muscle contraction and hormonal signaling. Option A reverses the regulatory logic. The enzyme IS regulated (C). While Ca2+ does activate it, it is not the only regulator (D).",

        "ATP is produced by the direct chemical coupling of electron transfer to phosphorylation without any intermediate energy form",
        "The gradient is formed by pumping potassium ions, not protons",
        "Electron transport through the ETC complexes pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient (proton-motive force) composed of both a pH gradient (delta-pH) and a membrane potential (delta-psi); protons flow back through ATP synthase (Complex V), which uses the energy of this gradient to drive the mechanical rotation of its rotor and catalyze ATP synthesis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis (1961, Nobel Prize 1978) revolutionized bioenergetics by proposing that the energy of electron transport is conserved as an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, not as a high-energy chemical intermediate (as the chemical coupling hypothesis proposed) or a conformational change (as the conformational coupling hypothesis proposed). The proton-motive force (pmf or delta-p) has two components: (1) delta-psi — the membrane potential (approximately -180 mV, matrix negative), which is the dominant component in mitochondria, contributing approximately 80% of the pmf. (2) delta-pH — the pH gradient (approximately 0.5-1 pH unit, matrix more alkaline), contributing approximately 20%. The relationship is: delta-p = delta-psi - (2.303RT/F)delta-pH. Complexes I, III, and IV of the ETC pump protons across the inner membrane as electrons flow downhill through the chain. ATP synthase (F1Fo-ATPase) then uses the pmf to drive rotational catalysis — protons flowing through the Fo channel cause the c-ring to rotate, which drives conformational changes in the F1 catalytic subunits (binding change mechanism, Boyer) that synthesize ATP from ADP + Pi. This is NOT substrate-level phosphorylation (A). There IS an intermediate energy form — the pmf (C). Protons, not K+ ions, are pumped (D).",

      "options": [
        "All components become fully reduced because electron flow is completely blocked",
        "All components become fully oxidized because the block prevents any reduction",
        "Only Complex III is affected; all other components function normally",
        "Components upstream of the block (Complex I, CoQ, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of Complex III upstream of the Qi site) become more reduced because they cannot donate electrons past the block; components downstream (cytochrome c, Complex IV, and O2) become more oxidized because they can no longer receive electrons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Antimycin A specifically blocks electron transfer in Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) at the Qi site (quinone reduction site on the matrix side), preventing the transfer of electrons from cytochrome bH to oxidized ubiquinone. This creates a bifurcation in the redox state of the ETC: UPSTREAM components (Complex I, ubiquinone pool, and the first half of the Q-cycle in Complex III — including the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 on the Qo side) become progressively more REDUCED. Electrons continue to flow from NADH into Complex I and through to ubiquinone, but cannot pass the antimycin A block. The ubiquinone pool becomes fully reduced (QH2 accumulates). Complex I also becomes reduced because its electron acceptor (Q) is unavailable. DOWNSTREAM components (cytochrome c, Complex IV including cytochrome a, cytochrome a3, and CuA/CuB centers) become more OXIDIZED because they continue to transfer any remaining electrons to O2, but receive no new electrons from the blocked Complex III. O2 is already the most oxidized component and remains so. This differential redox response is a classic experimental approach for mapping the order of electron carriers in the ETC. Not all components become fully reduced (A) — downstream ones become oxidized. Not all become oxidized (C). The block affects the entire chain, not just Complex III (D).",

      "options": [
        "FADH2 has a higher P/O ratio than NADH because FADH2 is a stronger reducing agent",
        "P/O ratios are identical for all substrates because ATP synthase operates at a fixed rate",
        "NADH has a P/O ratio of approximately 2.5 and FADH2 approximately 1.5, because NADH donates electrons at Complex I (pumping 4 H+), while FADH2 donates at Complex II (pumping 0 H+) — this means NADH-derived electrons drive proton pumping at Complexes I, III, and IV (total approximately 10 H+), while FADH2-derived electrons only drive pumping at Complexes III and IV (total approximately 6 H+); with approximately 4 H+ needed per ATP, this gives approximately 2.5 and 1.5 ATP per atom of oxygen",
        "Both NADH and FADH2 have P/O ratios of exactly 3.0 because they both donate 2 electrons"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The P/O ratio reflects the stoichiometry of ATP synthesis coupled to oxygen reduction, and it differs for NADH and FADH2 because they enter the ETC at different points. NADH (E'0 = -320 mV) donates electrons to Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), which pumps 4 H+ per pair of electrons. Electrons then pass through ubiquinone to Complex III (pumping 4 H+ via the Q-cycle) and through cytochrome c to Complex IV (pumping 2 H+ while reducing 1/2 O2 to H2O). Total: 10 H+ pumped per NADH. FADH2 (E'0 = -220 mV) donates electrons to Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), which does NOT pump protons — it simply transfers electrons to ubiquinone. Electrons then pass through Complexes III and IV as above. Total: 6 H+ pumped per FADH2. ATP synthase requires approximately 4 H+ per ATP (3 for the rotational catalysis + 1 for the Pi/ATP translocase). Therefore: NADH P/O = 10/4 = 2.5; FADH2 P/O = 6/4 = 1.5. Note these are non-integer values, correcting the older textbook values of 3 and 2. The difference is NOT because of electron number (A) — both donate 2 electrons. NADH is actually the stronger reducing agent, giving it the higher P/O ratio (C is backwards). P/O ratios differ based on entry point (D).",

        "To produce ethanol as a nutrient for the yeast cells",
        "To consume excess acetaldehyde that accumulates during aerobic respiration",
        "To generate additional ATP beyond what glycolysis produces",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Fermentation pathways (both alcoholic and lactic acid) serve one essential purpose: regeneration of NAD+ from NADH under anaerobic conditions. Glycolysis requires NAD+ at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step (reaction 6). Under aerobic conditions, the NADH produced is reoxidized by the electron transport chain. Under anaerobic conditions, without a functional ETC, NADH accumulates and NAD+ becomes depleted. Without NAD+, GAPDH cannot function, glycolysis stops, and no ATP can be produced — a lethal situation for obligate fermenters. In alcoholic fermentation: (1) Pyruvate decarboxylase (using TPP) converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde + CO2. (2) Alcohol dehydrogenase reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol using NADH, regenerating NAD+. The pathway does NOT generate additional ATP (A) — fermentation produces 0 ATP beyond the 2 from glycolysis. Ethanol is a waste product, not a nutrient (C) — indeed, it is toxic to yeast at high concentrations (>12-15%). Acetaldehyde does not accumulate during aerobic respiration (D) — it is specifically an intermediate of the fermentation pathway.",

      "options": [
        "The Q-cycle transfers electrons backward from cytochrome c to ubiquinone",
        "For each pair of electrons transferred from QH2 to cytochrome c, the Q-cycle oxidizes two QH2 molecules at the Qo site and reduces one Q to QH2 at the Qi site, resulting in the net translocation of 4 H+ to the intermembrane space and the transfer of 2 electrons (via two cytochrome c molecules) to Complex IV",
        "One QH2 is oxidized to Q, transferring both electrons to cytochrome c and pumping 2 H+ across the membrane",
        "The Q-cycle directly reduces oxygen to water at the Qi site"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Q-cycle (proposed by Peter Mitchell, refined by structural studies) is an elegant mechanism that doubles the number of protons translocated per pair of electrons through Complex III. It operates in two half-cycles: FIRST HALF: One QH2 binds the Qo (outer) site. One electron goes to the Rieske iron-sulfur protein → cytochrome c1 → cytochrome c (the high-potential chain). The other electron goes to cytochrome bL → cytochrome bH (the low-potential chain) → reduces Q to semiquinone (Q.-) at the Qi (inner) site. Two H+ from QH2 are released to the intermembrane space. SECOND HALF: A second QH2 binds the Qo site. Again, one electron goes to Rieske → cyt c1 → cyt c (second cytochrome c reduced). The other electron goes through bL → bH → reduces the semiquinone at Qi to QH2 (picking up 2 H+ from the matrix). Two more H+ from the second QH2 are released to the IMS. NET RESULT: 2 QH2 oxidized at Qo, 1 QH2 regenerated at Qi (net: 1 QH2 consumed); 2 cytochrome c reduced; 4 H+ released to IMS (2 per QH2 at Qo); 2 H+ consumed from matrix (at Qi). The Q-cycle does NOT reduce oxygen (C) — that occurs at Complex IV. Electrons flow forward, not backward (D).",

        "UCP1 blocks electron transport, stopping all mitochondrial respiration",
        "The energy stored in the proton gradient is released as heat instead of driving ATP synthesis — electron transport continues (and may even accelerate due to the reduced proton-motive force) but the energy is dissipated as thermal energy for non-shivering thermogenesis",
        "ATP production increases because the proton gradient is maintained more efficiently",
        "Uncoupling proteins pump additional protons to increase the gradient"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial inner membrane carriers that allow protons to flow down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space to the matrix, bypassing ATP synthase. This short-circuits the chemiosmotic coupling between electron transport and ATP synthesis. In brown adipose tissue (BAT), UCP1 (thermogenin) is highly expressed and activated by free fatty acids (released by beta-adrenergic signaling during cold exposure or after sympathetic nervous system activation). When protons leak through UCP1, the proton-motive force decreases, which actually STIMULATES electron transport — the ETC complexes pump protons faster trying to maintain the gradient, consuming more O2 and oxidizing more NADH/FADH2. However, since the energy is not captured as ATP, it is dissipated as heat. This non-shivering thermogenesis is critical for newborn mammals, hibernating animals, and cold-adapted adults. ATP production DECREASES, not increases (A). UCPs allow proton leak, they do not pump additional protons (C). Electron transport CONTINUES and may accelerate; it is not blocked (D). UCP1 is regulated by purine nucleotides (GDP, ATP inhibit) and fatty acids (activate).",

        "It is the only TCA cycle enzyme that is an integral inner membrane protein and also functions as Complex II of the electron transport chain — it directly transfers electrons from succinate (via FAD → Fe-S clusters) to ubiquinone without producing NADH, linking the TCA cycle to the ETC",

        "It is the only TCA cycle enzyme located in the cytoplasm rather than the mitochondrial matrix",
        "It is the only reversible reaction in an otherwise completely irreversible cycle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, also called succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase or Complex II) is unique because it serves dual functions: it is both a TCA cycle enzyme (catalyzing succinate → fumarate) and an integral component of the electron transport chain (Complex II). All other TCA cycle enzymes are soluble matrix proteins. SDH is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and contains: (1) a covalently bound FAD prosthetic group (not NAD+ — this is why the reaction produces FADH2 instead of NADH); (2) three iron-sulfur clusters (Fe2S2, Fe4S4, Fe3S4) that relay electrons from FADH2; (3) a ubiquinone binding site where electrons are transferred to the ubiquinone pool. The succinate → fumarate oxidation (E'0 = +30 mV) is not sufficiently exergonic to reduce NAD+ (E'0 = -320 mV), so FAD (E'0 = -220 mV) serves as the electron acceptor instead. SDH is in the inner membrane, not the cytoplasm (A). Succinyl-CoA synthetase uses GTP (in animals) or ATP, but that is a different enzyme (C).

        "Oxygen directly inhibits all glycolytic enzymes through oxidative modification",
        "Oxygen competes with glucose for binding to hexokinase, preventing glucose phosphorylation",
        "Under aerobic conditions, oxidative phosphorylation generates approximately 30-32 ATP per glucose (versus 2 from glycolysis alone), so far less glucose needs to be consumed to meet the same ATP demand — additionally, the increased ATP/AMP ratio under aerobic conditions inhibits phosphofructokinase-1, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis",
        "Aerobic conditions cause yeast cells to stop growing, eliminating the need for ATP"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Pasteur effect (first observed by Louis Pasteur in the 1860s) reflects the integration of glycolysis with oxidative phosphorylation through allosteric regulation. Under anaerobic conditions, fermentation yields only 2 ATP per glucose, so cells must consume glucose rapidly to meet energy demands. When oxygen becomes available, the mitochondrial ETC and oxidative phosphorylation become active, producing approximately 30-32 ATP per glucose — roughly 15-16 times more efficient. Two mechanisms reduce glycolytic flux: (1) THERMODYNAMIC: The cell's ATP demand is met with far less glucose, so less glycolytic flux is needed. (2) ALLOSTERIC: The increased ATP/AMP ratio (from efficient oxidative phosphorylation) inhibits PFK-1, the committed step of glycolysis. ATP binds PFK-1's inhibitory allosteric site, while AMP (which drops under aerobic conditions) no longer activates it. Additionally, citrate (which accumulates when the TCA cycle is active) also inhibits PFK-1. Oxygen does NOT directly inhibit glycolytic enzymes (A). Oxygen does not bind hexokinase (C).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Substrate-level phosphorylation depends on using phosphorylated compounds with higher phosphoryl transfer potential than ATP. 1,3-BPG is a mixed anhydride — its C-1 phosphate is an acyl phosphate (carboxylic acid-phosphoric acid anhydride) formed by the preceding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. The hydrolysis of acyl phosphates is highly exergonic (approximately -49.4 kJ/mol for 1,3-BPG) because: (1) the products (3-phosphoglycerate + Pi) are stabilized by resonance and charge repulsion relief, and (2) the mixed anhydride bond is thermodynamically unstable due to competing resonance between the carboxylate and phosphate groups. Since 1,3-BPG's phosphoryl transfer potential (-49.4 kJ/mol) exceeds ATP's (-30.5 kJ/mol), the transfer from 1,3-BPG to ADP is thermodynamically favorable: delta-G-zero-prime = (-49.4) - (-30.5) = -18.9 kJ/mol. This is why 1,3-BPG can drive ATP synthesis. The reaction IS thermodynamically favorable (A is wrong about the reasoning). No GTP is required (C).

        "The Warburg effect is an experimental artifact with no biological significance",
        "Aerobic glycolysis, while less efficient per glucose molecule, provides rapid ATP production and supplies biosynthetic precursors (glycolytic intermediates diverted to pentose phosphate pathway for nucleotides, to serine/glycine for amino acids, and to glycerol for lipid synthesis) that support the high proliferative demands of cancer cells",
        "Lactate production kills surrounding normal cells, giving cancer cells a competitive advantage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Otto Warburg observed in the 1920s that cancer cells consume glucose at rates 10-100 times higher than normal cells and produce lactate even under aerobic conditions (aerobic glycolysis). While this seems metabolically wasteful (2 ATP per glucose versus 30-32 from complete oxidation), it provides several advantages for rapidly proliferating cells: (1) RAPID ATP PRODUCTION: Although less ATP per glucose, glycolysis can produce ATP much faster than oxidative phosphorylation when glucose is abundant. The rate of ATP production can actually exceed that of OXPHOS. (2) BIOSYNTHETIC PRECURSORS: Rapidly dividing cells need building blocks — nucleotides, amino acids, lipids — more than they need maximal ATP. Glycolytic intermediates feed into: glucose-6-phosphate → pentose phosphate pathway (NADPH + ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis); 3-phosphoglycerate → serine → glycine → one-carbon metabolism; dihydroxyacetone phosphate → glycerol-3-phosphate → lipid synthesis; pyruvate → acetyl-CoA → fatty acid synthesis (via citrate shuttle). (3) REDOX BALANCE: Maintaining high glycolytic flux with lactate export helps manage the redox balance needed for biosynthesis. Most cancer cells do NOT have fundamentally defective mitochondria (A) — many maintain functional OXPHOS. While lactate acidification of the microenvironment may confer some advantage, this is secondary (C). The Warburg effect is well-established and therapeutically targeted via PET scanning using 18F-FDG (D).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) contains two heme groups (heme a and heme a3) and two copper centers (CuA and CuB). The binuclear center of heme a3-CuB is where O2 is reduced to H2O in a carefully controlled four-electron reduction. Cyanide (CN-) binds tightly to the ferric (Fe3+) form of heme a3, while carbon monoxide (CO) binds to the ferrous (Fe2+) form — both block oxygen from accessing its binding site at the terminal electron acceptor. The consequences cascade through the entire metabolic system: (1) Electron flow through the entire ETC stops because all carriers upstream become fully reduced (no terminal acceptor for electrons). (2) Proton pumping ceases because it is coupled to electron transport. (3) The proton-motive force collapses, stopping ATP synthase. (4) NADH and FADH2 accumulate because they cannot be reoxidized. (5) The TCA cycle stops because NAD+ and FAD are unavailable. (6) Cellular ATP drops rapidly, leading to failure of all ATP-dependent processes (ion pumps, biosynthesis, muscle contraction). Death occurs within minutes from respiratory failure. They do NOT inhibit Complex I (A) or ATP synthase directly (C). Oxygen consumption DECREASES, not increases (D).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cytoplasmic NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane (which is impermeable to NADH/NAD+), so shuttle systems transfer the reducing equivalents. MALATE-ASPARTATE SHUTTLE (liver, heart, kidney): Cytoplasmic NADH reduces oxaloacetate to malate (cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase). Malate enters the matrix via the malate-alpha-ketoglutarate antiporter. Matrix malate dehydrogenase reoxidizes malate to oxaloacetate, regenerating NADH in the matrix. This matrix NADH enters the ETC at Complex I, yielding approximately 2.5 ATP per NADH. Oxaloacetate is returned to the cytoplasm as aspartate (via transamination and the glutamate-aspartate antiporter). GLYCEROL-3-PHOSPHATE SHUTTLE (skeletal muscle, brain, insect flight muscle): Cytoplasmic NADH reduces DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate (cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD+-linked). Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (an inner membrane flavoprotein, FAD-linked) reoxidizes glycerol-3-phosphate to DHAP, transferring electrons to FAD → ubiquinone. Since electrons enter at the ubiquinone level (bypassing Complex I), they yield only approximately 1.5 ATP. The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle is kinetically faster (simpler, irreversible) but thermodynamically less efficient. FAD is NOT a better carrier (C) — it actually yields less ATP.

      "explanation": "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) complex catalyzes the second oxidative decarboxylation of the TCA cycle: alpha-ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA → succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH. Structurally and mechanistically, it is homologous to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, using the same five cofactors (TPP, lipoamide, CoA, FAD, NAD+). Its regulation follows a logical energy-sensing pattern: INHIBITION: (1) Succinyl-CoA — product inhibition. When succinyl-CoA accumulates (indicating sufficient biosynthetic precursor supply or downstream congestion), it inhibits alpha-KGDH by competing with CoA at the E2 active site. (2) NADH — product inhibition and energy signal. High NADH/NAD+ ratio indicates the cell has sufficient reducing equivalents. (3) ATP — high energy charge. ACTIVATION: (1) Ca2+ — in mitochondria, Ca2+ concentration increases during muscle contraction and hormonal stimulation, activating alpha-KGDH (as well as isocitrate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase) to increase TCA cycle flux to meet increased energy demand. (2) ADP — low energy charge signal. Option A reverses the regulation. The enzyme IS tightly regulated (C). While oxygen indirectly affects it via NADH/NAD+ ratio, it is not the sole regulator (D).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Paul Boyer's binding change mechanism (Nobel Prize 1997, shared with John Walker) elegantly explains rotational catalysis in ATP synthase. The F1 component contains three alpha-beta heterodimers arranged in a ring around the asymmetric gamma subunit (part of the central stalk). The key insight is that each catalytic beta subunit exists in one of three conformational states at any given time, determined by the rotational position of the gamma shaft: O (open) — low affinity for ligands; this is where ATP is released. L (loose) — binds ADP and Pi loosely. T (tight) — substrates are bound tightly and the equilibrium between ADP+Pi and ATP actually FAVORS ATP formation (Keq approximately 1 on the enzyme surface). The remarkable insight is that the actual phosphoanhydride bond formation is nearly isoenergonic on the enzyme surface — the energy from the proton gradient is used primarily to drive the conformational change from T→O that RELEASES the tightly bound ATP product. Proton flow through the Fo membrane channel drives rotation of the c-ring and attached gamma subunit, causing sequential conformational changes in the three beta subunits. Each 360-degree rotation produces 3 ATP molecules. The mechanism requires both Fo and F1 coupled mechanically (C is wrong). Conformational changes are central to the mechanism (D is wrong). It involves three active sites, not one (B).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) is the single most potent allosteric activator of PFK-1. It is produced by the bifunctional enzyme phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2). In liver, insulin signaling activates a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PFK-2, activating its kinase domain and increasing F-2,6-BP levels. F-2,6-BP activates PFK-1 by: (1) increasing the enzyme's affinity for its substrate fructose-6-phosphate (lowering K0.5), (2) relieving the allosteric inhibition by ATP and citrate, and (3) shifting the T/R equilibrium strongly toward the active R state. Remarkably, F-2,6-BP activates PFK-1 at concentrations as low as 1 micromolar. Conversely, glucagon signaling (via cAMP-PKA) phosphorylates PFK-2, activating its phosphatase domain, lowering F-2,6-BP, and reducing glycolytic flux. Glucose-6-phosphate is NOT a direct activator of PFK-1 (A). ATP is actually a substrate AND an allosteric inhibitor (at the regulatory site), not an activator (B). Citrate is an INHIBITOR of PFK-1, not an activator (D) — high citrate signals energy/biosynthetic sufficiency.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Cori cycle (named after Carl and Gerty Cori, Nobel Prize 1947) is a metabolic cycle that links glycolysis in muscle with gluconeogenesis in the liver. During intense exercise, skeletal muscle produces lactate via anaerobic glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase reduces pyruvate to lactate, regenerating NAD+). Lactate is exported from muscle via MCT (monocarboxylate transporter) proteins into the bloodstream. The liver takes up blood lactate and converts it back to glucose through gluconeogenesis — a process that requires 6 ATP equivalents per glucose (4 ATP + 2 GTP). This glucose is released back into the blood and can be taken up by muscle for another round of glycolysis. The Cori cycle effectively shifts the metabolic burden of lactate recycling from muscle (which lacks sufficient gluconeogenic enzymes) to the liver (which has abundant gluconeogenic capacity). The net effect is an energy cost — muscle gains 2 ATP from glycolysis, but liver spends 6 ATP on gluconeogenesis, for a net cost of 4 ATP per cycle, paid by the liver's oxidative metabolism. Lactate is NOT trapped in muscle (A) and is not directly converted to ATP (C). Lactate requires enzymatic conversion (D) — it does not spontaneously decompose.",

        "ROS are produced equally at all four complexes of the ETC"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mitochondrial electron transport is not perfectly efficient — approximately 0.1-2% of electrons leak from the chain and react directly with molecular oxygen to form superoxide anion radical (O2.-), the primary mitochondrial ROS. The two major sites are: COMPLEX I: Electrons can leak from the fully reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) or from the N2 iron-sulfur cluster when the ubiquinone-binding site is occupied. This occurs particularly during reverse electron transport (when succinate-derived electrons drive NADH reduction at Complex I via a high proton-motive force). COMPLEX III: During the Q-cycle, the ubisemiquinone radical (Q.-) at the Qo site is a thermodynamically unstable species that can donate its unpaired electron to O2, forming O2.-. This is especially problematic when electron flow downstream is impaired (e.g., by antimycin A). Superoxide is released into both the matrix (Complex I, Complex III Qi site) and the intermembrane space (Complex III Qo site). Cells possess antioxidant defenses: superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts O2.- to H2O2, and catalase/glutathione peroxidase converts H2O2 to H2O. Complex II produces minimal ROS. Complex V does not produce ROS (C). ROS production actually increases when the ETC is highly reduced (D is wrong).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Glucokinase (GK, hexokinase IV) has two critical kinetic differences from hexokinases I-III that are perfectly adapted for its role in liver glucose homeostasis: (1) HIGH Km: GK has Km approximately 10 mM for glucose (compared to approximately 0.1 mM for hexokinase I). Blood glucose normally ranges from 4-5 mM (fasting) to 8-10 mM (postprandial). Since GK's Km is near the upper physiological range, GK activity increases nearly linearly with blood glucose over the physiological range. This allows the liver to act as a glucose sensor — increasing glucose phosphorylation (and subsequent glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis) proportionally as blood glucose rises after a meal. (2) NO PRODUCT INHIBITION: Unlike hexokinases I-III (which are potently inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate at micromolar concentrations), GK is NOT inhibited by G6P. This allows the liver to continue phosphorylating glucose even when G6P accumulates, enabling the liver to serve as a glucose buffer. Additionally, GK displays sigmoidal kinetics (Hill coefficient approximately 1.7) and is regulated by glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) that sequesters GK in the nucleus when glucose is low. GK mutations cause MODY-2 diabetes. Option A has the wrong Km and reasoning. Options C and D are factually incorrect.",

It does not require oxygen and can function under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This is consistent with its evolution before atmospheric O2 accumulated. All 10 glycolytic enzymes are soluble cytoplasmic proteins (except for some that associate with the outer mitochondrial membrane or cytoskeletal elements). S2 is FALSE: While the energy-payoff phase produces 4 ATP (2 from phosphoglycerate kinase, 2 from pyruvate kinase) and 2 NADH (from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), the energy-investment phase consumes 2 ATP (hexokinase and PFK-1). The NET yield is therefore 2 ATP and 2 NADH per glucose, not 4 ATP. The statement says 'net energy yield' of 4 ATP, which is incorrect. S3 is TRUE: PFK-1 catalyzes fructose-6-phosphate + ATP → fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP. This is the first committed step of glycolysis (glucose-6-phosphate from hexokinase can enter other pathways like PPP or glycogen synthesis, but F-1,6-BP is committed to glycolysis). PFK-1 is the primary regulatory target, controlled by ATP (inhibitor), AMP (activator), citrate (inhibitor), and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (most potent activator). S4 is TRUE: Glycolysis comprises 10 reactions in two phases. The investment phase (reactions 1-5) uses 2 ATP to phosphorylate glucose to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and split it into two triose phosphates.

The overall equation per acetyl-CoA: acetyl-CoA + 3 NAD+ + FAD + GDP + Pi + 2 H2O → 2 CO2 + 3 NADH + FADH2 + GTP + CoA. S2 is FALSE: Oxaloacetate is NOT consumed stoichiometrically — it is regenerated with each turn of the cycle. The cycle begins when acetyl-CoA condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate (citrate synthase), and after seven more reactions, oxaloacetate is regenerated. OAA is catalytic, not stoichiometric. It does not need to be continually resynthesized from diet — it is recycled. However, when TCA intermediates are withdrawn for biosynthesis (cataplerosis), anaplerotic reactions replenish them. S3 is TRUE: Anaplerotic reactions (Greek 'filling up') replenish TCA cycle intermediates. The most important is pyruvate carboxylase: pyruvate + CO2 + ATP → oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi. This biotin-dependent enzyme is activated by acetyl-CoA — when acetyl-CoA accumulates (from beta-oxidation or amino acid catabolism), it signals the need for more OAA to keep the cycle running.

This is essential because the proton-motive force (approximately 200 mV) would rapidly dissipate if protons could leak back freely. The membrane's high content of cardiolipin (a four-acyl-chain phospholipid unique to this membrane) contributes to its impermeability. Protons can only return to the matrix through specific channels — primarily ATP synthase (productive) or UCPs (for thermogenesis). S2 is TRUE: Oligomycin (a macrolide antibiotic from Streptomyces) binds to the c-subunits of the Fo channel, physically blocking proton translocation. Without proton flow, the F1 catalytic subunits cannot undergo the rotational conformational changes needed for ATP synthesis. Oligomycin is a classic experimental tool for studying chemiosmotic coupling. S3 is TRUE: This demonstrates the tight coupling between electron transport and ATP synthesis. When oligomycin blocks proton return through ATP synthase, protons pumped by the ETC accumulate in the IMS, increasing the pmf. As the pmf rises, it becomes thermodynamically more difficult (and eventually impossible) for the ETC complexes to pump additional protons against the larger gradient. Electron transport therefore slows and eventually stops. This respiratory control demonstrates that the ETC and ATP synthase are coupled through the proton gradient. S4 is FALSE: FCCP is NOT an ATP synthase activator — it is a chemical uncoupler (protonophore).

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: Human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is stereospecific, producing exclusively L-lactate (also called (S)-lactate). The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to L-lactate with concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD+. D-lactate is produced by certain bacteria using D-specific LDH enzymes. The distinction is clinically relevant because D-lactate accumulation (D-lactic acidosis) can occur in short bowel syndrome from bacterial overgrowth. S2 is FALSE: Obligate aerobes (strict aerobes) CANNOT switch to fermentation — by definition, they require oxygen for growth and energy production. They lack the fermentation enzymes needed for anaerobic ATP production (or their metabolism is too dependent on oxidative phosphorylation). Examples include Mycobacterium tuberculosis and most mitochondria-containing eukaryotic cells (although many eukaryotes are actually facultative and can ferment). Organisms that CAN switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation are called facultative anaerobes (e.g., yeast, E. coli). S3 is TRUE: Alcoholic fermentation proceeds in two steps: (1) Pyruvate decarboxylase (requires TPP/thiamine pyrophosphate as cofactor) removes CO2 from pyruvate to yield acetaldehyde. (2) Alcohol dehydrogenase reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol using NADH as the reductant, regenerating NAD+. This NAD+ regeneration is the essential purpose of the pathway. S4 is FALSE: Fermentation yields only 2 ATP per glucose (net from glycolysis), while aerobic respiration yields approximately 30-32 ATP per glucose — a 15-16 fold difference in efficiency.",

From the data: RCR = 85/18 = 4.72, indicating well-coupled mitochondria (typical values for isolated mitochondria are 3-10, depending on substrate and tissue). STATE ANALYSIS: State 1 (mitochondria alone, no substrate): Minimal respiration — only endogenous substrates are oxidized. State 2 (+ succinate): Modest increase to 15 — substrate is available but without ADP, ATP synthase cannot operate, and the high pmf limits proton pumping, restricting electron transport. State 3 (+ ADP): Dramatic increase to 85 — ADP drives ATP synthase, protons flow back through Fo, pmf decreases, and the ETC accelerates to restore the gradient. This is the maximum phosphorylating respiration rate. State 4 (ADP exhausted): Returns to 18 — all ADP has been phosphorylated to ATP, ATP synthase stops, pmf builds up again, restricting ETC. Slightly higher than State 2 due to proton leak. State 3u (+ FCCP): Highest rate at 110 — the uncoupler dissipates pmf completely, removing all thermodynamic back-pressure on the ETC. This represents the maximum capacity of the ETC itself (uncoupled respiration). The fact that State 3u > State 3 shows that under normal coupled conditions, the pmf imposes a kinetic constraint on ETC activity. Option A uses the wrong states. Option C uses uncoupled rate, but RCR is specifically State 3/State 4. Option D is wrong — the units are appropriate for RCR calculation.",

The positive value indicates a spontaneous (exergonic) electron transfer. Using the Nernst equation relationship: delta-G'0 = -nF(delta-E'0), where n = 2 (electrons per NADH), F = 96,485 J/(V*mol) approximately 96.5 kJ/(V*mol). delta-G'0 = -2 x 96.5 x 1.136 = -219.2 kJ/mol. This is a large negative free energy, indicating a highly exergonic process. Theoretically, 219.2/30.5 = 7.2 ATP molecules could be synthesized per NADH if coupling were 100% efficient. In practice, only approximately 2.5 ATP are produced per NADH (P/O ratio = 2.5), giving a thermodynamic efficiency of approximately 2.5 x 30.5/219.2 = 34.8%. The remaining energy is used to maintain the proton gradient at steady state, drive transport processes, and is inevitably lost as heat (second law of thermodynamics). The energy is NOT insufficient (B). The delta-G is negative, meaning the transfer IS spontaneous (C). ATP is not produced independently at each component (D) — energy is conserved as a proton gradient and then used collectively by ATP synthase.",

Then add the test compound. THREE PREDICTIONS: (1) ETC INHIBITOR (e.g., rotenone, antimycin A, cyanide): Blocks electron flow → OCR decreases. Adding FCCP afterward does NOT restore respiration because electrons cannot flow regardless of the gradient. (2) UNCOUPLER (e.g., FCCP, DNP, thermogenin): Dissipates the proton gradient → removes back-pressure on ETC → OCR INCREASES above State 3 (toward maximal ETC capacity). ATP synthesis simultaneously decreases because pmf is dissipated. (3) ATP SYNTHASE INHIBITOR (e.g., oligomycin): Blocks proton return through ATP synthase → pmf builds up → back-pressure slows ETC → OCR decreases to State 4 level. Adding FCCP afterward RESTORES high OCR because the ETC is not blocked — only the coupling is affected.

PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH: Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a specific inhibitor of PDH kinase (PDK), the enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates PDC. Treatment with DCA keeps PDC in its dephosphorylated (active) state. If phosphorylation is the regulatory mechanism, DCA treatment should increase PDC activity and acetyl-CoA/NADH production. Conversely, conditions that activate PDK (high acetyl-CoA/CoA, NADH/NAD+, ATP/ADP ratios) should increase phosphorylation and decrease activity. BIOCHEMICAL APPROACH: Direct measurement of phosphorylation status using P-32 labeling (incubate with gamma-P-32-ATP) or phospho-specific antibodies (immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Ser-264 antibodies) correlated with activity measurements provides direct evidence. GENETIC APPROACH: Mutating the phosphorylation sites (Ser→Ala mutations prevent phosphorylation; Ser→Asp mutations mimic constitutive phosphorylation) and measuring the resulting PDC activity definitively establishes causality between phosphorylation and activity. PDH phosphatase (PDP) is activated by Ca2+ and insulin signaling, linking PDC activity to hormonal control. Total CO2 output (A) is too indirect. mRNA levels (C) reflect transcriptional regulation, not post-translational phosphorylation.

CPT-I is the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation and is inhibited by malonyl-CoA (the first committed intermediate of fatty acid synthesis, ensuring that synthesis and oxidation do not occur simultaneously). (2) Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (an integral inner membrane protein): Transports acylcarnitine into the matrix while simultaneously exporting free carnitine (antiport). (3) CPT-II (on the matrix face of the inner membrane): Transfers the acyl group back from carnitine to matrix CoA, regenerating acyl-CoA in the matrix and releasing free carnitine for recycling.

It catalyzes an obligatory 1:1 exchange of matrix ATP4- for cytoplasmic ADP3-. This antiport is electrogenic because it results in the net export of one negative charge from the matrix per exchange cycle. Since the membrane potential is approximately -180 mV (matrix negative), exporting a negative charge works against the electrical gradient, requiring energy from the membrane potential. This means one proton's worth of energy from the pmf is consumed for each ATP/ADP exchange. Additionally, the phosphate carrier (PiC) imports inorganic phosphate (H2PO4-) into the matrix via H+ symport, consuming one additional proton per Pi imported. Combined, the transport of ADP + Pi in and ATP out costs approximately 1 H+ equivalent beyond the approximately 3 H+ needed to drive one 120-degree rotation of ATP synthase. This is why the total cost is approximately 4 H+ per ATP synthesized and exported (3 for synthesis + 1 for transport), giving the non-integer P/O ratios of 2.5 and 1.5. ANT is NOT passive (A).

The large negative delta-G-zero-prime (-31.4 kJ/mol) and the even more negative actual delta-G in vivo (approximately -23 kJ/mol) make this reaction essentially irreversible under physiological conditions. The thermodynamic driving force comes from two sources: (1) Substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (consuming approximately -30.5 kJ/mol of the PEP hydrolysis energy). (2) The spontaneous tautomerization of enolpyruvate (the initial product) to the much more stable keto form of pyruvate, which contributes an additional large exergonic driving force. This keto-enol tautomerization is spontaneous and essentially irreversible, pulling the overall equilibrium strongly toward product formation. Because this reaction is irreversible, gluconeogenesis cannot simply reverse it. Instead, two enzymes are needed to bypass it: (1) Pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate + CO2 + ATP → oxaloacetate, in the mitochondrial matrix) and (2) PEPCK (oxaloacetate + GTP → PEP + CO2, in cytoplasm).

The key reason is that the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (pyruvate → acetyl-CoA) is irreversible in animals, and there is no pathway to convert acetyl-CoA back to pyruvate or any gluconeogenic precursor. The two carbons of acetyl-CoA that enter the TCA cycle are lost as 2 CO2 (at isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) before oxaloacetate is regenerated, so there is no NET carbon gain.

The reaction proceeds in two steps: (1) The methyl carbon of acetyl-CoA attacks the carbonyl of oxaloacetate, forming the intermediate citryl-CoA (enzyme-bound). This condensation step alone would not be sufficiently exergonic to drive the reaction forward. (2) Citryl-CoA is hydrolyzed to citrate + CoA-SH. The hydrolysis of the thioester bond of citryl-CoA (similar to acetyl-CoA hydrolysis, delta-G-zero-prime approximately -31.4 kJ/mol) provides a large free energy decrease that makes the overall reaction highly exergonic (delta-G-zero-prime = -32.2 kJ/mol). This is a common thermodynamic strategy — coupling an unfavorable condensation to a favorable thioester hydrolysis to drive the overall reaction forward. The reaction is NOT endergonic (A). No GTP is needed (C). The reaction is far from equilibrium with a large negative delta-G (D), making it one of the three irreversible regulatory steps of the TCA cycle. Citrate synthase is regulated by substrate availability (oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA) and product inhibition (citrate, succinyl-CoA, NADH).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a classic chemical uncoupler. Its mechanism: DNP is a lipophilic weak acid (pKa approximately 4.0). In its protonated form (DNP-H), it dissolves in the inner mitochondrial membrane's lipid bilayer and diffuses to the matrix side. In the alkaline matrix (pH approximately 8), it releases its proton. The deprotonated form (DNP-) is still lipophilic enough to diffuse back to the IMS (due to electron delocalization across the nitro groups), where it picks up another proton. This continuous cycling dissipates the proton gradient. METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES: Without a functional pmf, ATP synthase cannot produce ATP at normal rates. The cell senses falling ATP levels and responds by: (1) Activating AMPK, stimulating catabolic pathways. (2) Increasing substrate oxidation (glycolysis, beta-oxidation, TCA cycle). (3) The ETC runs at maximal rate (no back-pressure from pmf). All this fuel oxidation generates heat rather than ATP — causing weight loss from fat burning but also hyperthermia. DANGER: The therapeutic window is extremely narrow. A dose only 2-3 times the 'effective' dose can cause fatal hyperthermia (body temperature >40 degrees C), profuse sweating, tachycardia, and death. There is no antidote. DNP was banned in 1938 by the FDA. It does NOT block absorption (A), directly burn fat chemically (C), or increase appetite (D).",

This is a trans-elimination (dehydrogenation) that removes two hydrogen atoms from the C2 and C3 carbons of succinate, creating the trans (E) double bond of fumarate. The reaction is stereospecific — only the trans isomer is produced (fumarate), not the cis isomer (maleate). The enzyme uses FAD rather than NAD+ as the electron acceptor because the succinate/fumarate half-reaction (E'0 = +30 mV) is not sufficiently exergonic to reduce NAD+ (E'0 = -320 mV), but can reduce FAD (E'0 approximately -220 mV, though when covalently bound in SDH, the effective potential is modified). FAD is covalently linked to a histidine residue of the SDHA subunit. After FAD accepts the hydride, electrons pass through three Fe-S clusters ([2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S]) to the ubiquinone-binding site, where they reduce Q to QH2.

BETA-OXIDATION (7 rounds for C16): Each round removes 2 carbons as acetyl-CoA and produces 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH. 7 rounds yield: 8 acetyl-CoA + 7 FADH2 + 7 NADH.

This dual regulation prevents a futile cycle (F-6-P → F-1,6-BP → F-6-P) that would waste ATP. The levels of F-2,6-BP are controlled by the bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/FBPase-2: In the FED state (insulin signaling): PFK-2/FBPase-2 is dephosphorylated → PFK-2 kinase activity dominates → F-2,6-BP rises → glycolysis stimulated, gluconeogenesis inhibited.

When these ratios are high, PDK is activated, phosphorylates PDC, and slows pyruvate oxidation. Conversely, when these ratios are low (energy depletion), PDK is inhibited, PDC remains dephosphorylated and active.

Electron transport races at maximum uncoupled rate (OCR = 145%), proving the ETC components are fully functional — they were merely being held back by the high pmf. However, ATP production remains negligible (5%) because: (1) ATP synthase is still blocked by oligomycin. (2) The pmf is dissipated by FCCP, so even if some proton channels were open, there is no gradient to drive ATP synthesis. KEY INSIGHT: The ETC and ATP synthase are coupled ONLY through the proton gradient. They share no direct chemical or conformational linkage. This is the essence of Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis. Option A is wrong — they ARE coupled (through the pmf). Option C reverses the actual result. The data are entirely consistent (D).",

COMPLEX I MEASUREMENT: Glutamate/malate are metabolized in the matrix to produce NADH (glutamate dehydrogenase: glutamate → alpha-ketoglutarate + NADH; malate dehydrogenase: malate → oxaloacetate + NADH). This NADH enters the ETC exclusively at Complex I. The resulting OCR represents Complex I-driven respiration. Adding ADP (State 3) gives the coupled Complex I respiration rate. COMPLEX II MEASUREMENT: First, rotenone is added to completely block Complex I (preventing any NADH-derived electron flow). Then succinate is added — it is oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II), which transfers electrons directly to ubiquinone via FADH2 and Fe-S clusters, bypassing Complex I entirely. The OCR measured with rotenone + succinate represents Complex II-driven respiration. VALIDATION: Adding antimycin A (Complex III inhibitor) should block both Complex I and Complex II-driven respiration, confirming that both pathways converge at ubiquinone → Complex III → Complex IV. This approach is widely used in clinical mitochondrial diagnostics (e.g., using Seahorse XF Analyzer). ATP levels alone (A) cannot distinguish complex contributions.

(2) The phosphoryl group is transferred from succinyl-phosphate to a histidine residue on the enzyme, forming a phosphohistidine intermediate. (3) The phosphoryl group is transferred from phosphohistidine to GDP, forming GTP. The driving force is the hydrolysis of the thioester bond of succinyl-CoA, which has a large negative delta-G-zero-prime (approximately -33.5 kJ/mol) — sufficient to drive phosphorylation of GDP (requiring approximately +30.5 kJ/mol).

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Hexokinase I product inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is a fundamental regulatory mechanism that coordinates glucose phosphorylation with metabolic demand. When downstream pathways are active and consuming G6P rapidly, [G6P] remains low and hexokinase operates freely. When downstream pathways slow down (glycolysis is inhibited by high ATP/citrate; PPP flux is limited by NADPH demand; glycogen stores are full), G6P accumulates and inhibits hexokinase I at physiological concentrations (Ki approximately 0.04 mM, well within the normal intracellular [G6P] range of 0.05-0.2 mM). This prevents: (1) WASTEFUL ATP CONSUMPTION — each glucose phosphorylation consumes 1 ATP. If hexokinase were unregulated, it would consume ATP without productive metabolism. (2) PHOSPHATE SEQUESTRATION — trapping Pi as organic phosphate esters would deplete the cell's inorganic phosphate pool, affecting all phosphate-requiring reactions. (3) OSMOTIC STRESS — accumulation of G6P (a charged molecule that cannot cross the membrane) would increase intracellular osmolarity. Notably, glucokinase (hexokinase IV in liver) is NOT inhibited by G6P, allowing the liver to continue phosphorylating glucose after meals regardless of [G6P].

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolic hub with multiple fates: (A) FATTY ACID SYNTHESIS — correct fate. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is exported to the cytoplasm as citrate (citrate + ATP + CoA → acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate, catalyzed by ATP-citrate lyase). Cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA is then carboxylated to malonyl-CoA (by ACC) and used for fatty acid synthesis. (B) KETOGENESIS — correct fate. During fasting or uncontrolled diabetes, excess hepatic acetyl-CoA (from beta-oxidation, when OAA is diverted to gluconeogenesis) is converted to ketone bodies: 2 acetyl-CoA → acetoacetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → acetoacetate → beta-hydroxybutyrate (or spontaneous decarboxylation to acetone). Ketone bodies serve as fuel for brain, heart, and muscle. (C) CHOLESTEROL SYNTHESIS — correct fate. Acetyl-CoA → acetoacetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → mevalonate (by HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step and statin target) → isopentenyl-PP → squalene → cholesterol → steroid hormones. (D) GLUCONEOGENESIS FROM ACETYL-CoA — this is NOT possible in animals. The pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is irreversible, and the two carbons of acetyl-CoA entering the TCA cycle are lost as 2 CO2 before OAA is regenerated.

      "explanation": "Metformin's mechanism of action involves multiple pathways, but a key component is mild Complex I inhibition in hepatocytes. At therapeutic concentrations, metformin accumulates in mitochondria (driven by the membrane potential) and mildly inhibits Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase). This reduces electron transport → reduces proton pumping → reduces ATP synthesis. The resulting decrease in ATP and increase in AMP activates AMPK, a master metabolic sensor kinase. AMPK activation produces multiple downstream effects: (1) INHIBITS HEPATIC GLUCONEOGENESIS: AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits key transcriptional coactivators (CRTC2, HDAC4) that drive expression of gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK, G6Pase), reducing glucose output by the liver. (2) ENHANCES GLUCOSE UPTAKE: AMPK promotes GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle, increasing glucose uptake. (3) STIMULATES FATTY ACID OXIDATION: AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), reducing malonyl-CoA levels, which relieves inhibition of CPT-I and promotes fatty acid beta-oxidation. (4) INHIBITS LIPOGENESIS: Reduced ACC activity also decreases fatty acid synthesis. Metformin does NOT stimulate insulin secretion (A) — that distinguishes it from sulfonylureas.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The LDH reaction (pyruvate + NADH + H+ → lactate + NAD+) IS a redox reaction — pyruvate is REDUCED to lactate (the C2 keto group is reduced to a hydroxyl), and NADH is OXIDIZED to NAD+. However, within the context of the overall fermentation pathway (glucose → 2 lactate), the net oxidation state of carbon does not change from glucose to lactate. In glucose, the average carbon oxidation state is 0 (C6H12O6). In lactate (C3H6O3), the average carbon oxidation state is also 0. This makes sense because fermentation involves no net oxidation — no external electron acceptor (like O2) is used. The NADH produced in glycolysis (at GAPDH) is consumed by LDH, so the NAD+/NADH balance is maintained internally. The LDH reaction specifically involves the transfer of a hydride from NADH to the C2 carbonyl of pyruvate, reducing it to a secondary alcohol. This is indeed a redox reaction (A is wrong).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Each human cell contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria, each with 2-10 copies of the circular mtDNA (total approximately 1000-10000 copies per cell). Heteroplasmy refers to the coexistence of two or more different mtDNA genotypes (e.g., wild-type and mutant) within the same cell. Key implications: (1) THRESHOLD EFFECT: Mitochondrial function is maintained as long as the proportion of wild-type mtDNA exceeds a minimum threshold (typically 20-40% wild-type, or equivalently, symptoms appear when mutant mtDNA exceeds approximately 60-80%). Below this threshold, the wild-type copies produce enough functional ETC components to sustain adequate OXPHOS. (2) RANDOM MITOTIC SEGREGATION: During cell division, mitochondria (and their mtDNA) are distributed randomly to daughter cells. This means the proportion of mutant mtDNA can vary widely between cells, tissues, and even between family members inheriting the same mutation from their mother. (3) TISSUE-SPECIFIC EFFECTS: Tissues with high energy demands (brain, muscle, heart, retina) are most vulnerable to OXPHOS deficiency, explaining why mitochondrial diseases often present as encephalomyopathies, cardiomyopathies, and optic neuropathies. When all mtDNA copies are identical, it is called homoplasmy (A describes this). Nuclear DNA mutations are separate from mtDNA heteroplasmy (C). Heteroplasmy is not a repair mechanism (D).",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "This is an elegant example of metabolic logic. Citrate has a hydroxyl group at C3, but this is a TERTIARY alcohol — the carbon bearing the -OH is bonded to three other carbons (including the carboxylate group). Tertiary alcohols cannot be directly oxidized by NAD+- or FAD-dependent dehydrogenases because the oxidation product would require forming a C=O bond on a carbon already bonded to three carbons, which is energetically and mechanistically unfavorable (no hydrogen to remove from the hydroxyl-bearing carbon). Aconitase solves this problem through a two-step dehydration-rehydration mechanism: (1) Removes water from citrate to form the intermediate cis-aconitate (with a C=C double bond). (2) Re-adds water to the opposite end of the double bond, placing the hydroxyl on C2 instead of C3. This creates ISOCITRATE, a SECONDARY alcohol (the hydroxyl-bearing carbon is bonded to only two other carbons). Isocitrate dehydrogenase can then oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone (oxalosuccinate intermediate), followed by decarboxylation to alpha-ketoglutarate. The aconitase reaction uses an [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster to coordinate the substrate and catalyze the stereospecific dehydration/rehydration.

      "explanation": "Adenylate kinase (also called myokinase in muscle) catalyzes the reversible reaction: 2 ADP ↔ ATP + AMP. This seemingly simple reaction has profound implications for metabolic regulation through SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION. Consider a cell with initial concentrations: [ATP] = 5 mM, [ADP] = 0.5 mM, [AMP] = 0.05 mM (adenylate energy charge = 0.95). If 10% of ATP is consumed: [ATP] drops from 5.0 to 4.5 mM (10% decrease), [ADP] rises from 0.5 to 1.0 mM (100% increase). The adenylate kinase equilibrium then converts some of this ADP to ATP + AMP, causing [AMP] to rise from 0.05 to approximately 0.3 mM (approximately 600% increase!). This amplification means that AMP concentration is an extremely sensitive indicator of energy status — a modest 10% decline in ATP produces a many-fold increase in AMP. AMP serves as a critical allosteric activator of: (1) PFK-1 (stimulating glycolysis), (2) AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase, the master metabolic sensor), (3) Glycogen phosphorylase (stimulating glycogenolysis). AMP also allosterically inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (blocking gluconeogenesis). The reaction does NOT synthesize AMP de novo (A). It plays a central role in energy sensing (C).

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mitochondrial supercomplexes (also called respirasomes) are stable associations of individual ETC complexes. The most common supercomplex in mammalian mitochondria is the respirasome: Complex I + Complex III dimer + Complex IV (I-III2-IV), though I-III2 is also abundant. Cryo-EM structures have confirmed their existence and organization. Proposed advantages: (1) SUBSTRATE CHANNELING: By positioning CoQ reduction (Complex I) and CoQ oxidation (Complex III) sites in close proximity, electrons are channeled through a dedicated CoQ pool trapped within the supercomplex rather than relying on diffusion through the bulk membrane CoQ pool. Similarly, cytochrome c may shuttle within a confined space between Complex III and IV. (2) REDUCED ROS PRODUCTION: Shorter electron transfer distances and channeled CoQ reduce the lifetime of reactive intermediates (especially semiquinone at the Qo site of Complex III), decreasing electron leak to O2. (3) INCREASED EFFICIENCY: Kinetic modeling and experimental data suggest that supercomplex organization increases overall electron transfer rates compared to randomly distributed complexes. (4) COMPLEX I STABILITY: Association with Complex III stabilizes Complex I, preventing its degradation. Supercomplexes are clearly functional (A). They have been confirmed by blue-native PAGE, cryo-EM, and crosslinking mass spectrometry (C). They exist in both animals and plants (D).",

NADH (E'0 = -320 mV) has a strong tendency to donate electrons, while O2 (E'0 = +816 mV) has a strong tendency to accept electrons. Electrons flow spontaneously from lower to higher reduction potential: delta-E'0 = +816 - (-320) = +1136 mV, corresponding to delta-G'0 = -219 kJ/mol (highly exergonic). S2 is FALSE: The energy released during electron transport is NOT captured entirely as heat. Instead, it is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating the proton-motive force. This stored energy then drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. Approximately 34% of the energy is captured as ATP; the remainder is dissipated as heat (consistent with the second law of thermodynamics). S3 is TRUE: The ETC components are arranged in order of increasing (more positive) reduction potential: NADH (-320 mV) → FMN (-300 mV) → Fe-S clusters → CoQ (+45 mV) → cytochrome b (+77 mV) → cytochrome c1 (+215 mV) → cytochrome c (+254 mV) → CuA (+245 mV) → cytochrome a (+290 mV) → CuB/cytochrome a3 (+800 mV) → O2 (+816 mV).

Regulated by substrate availability (OAA, acetyl-CoA) and product/allosteric inhibition (citrate, NADH, succinyl-CoA, ATP). (2) Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+-dependent, IDH3): isocitrate → alpha-KG. Activated by ADP, Ca2+; inhibited by ATP, NADH. (3) Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase: alpha-KG → succinyl-CoA. Inhibited by succinyl-CoA, NADH; activated by Ca2+. S2 is TRUE: All three catalyze essentially irreversible reactions with large negative delta-G values under cellular conditions: citrate synthase (approximately -32 kJ/mol standard, even more negative in vivo), isocitrate dehydrogenase (approximately -21 kJ/mol), alpha-KGDH (approximately -33 kJ/mol). Their far-from-equilibrium status means their flux is determined by enzyme regulation (kinetic control), not mass action (thermodynamic control). Each is subject to allosteric regulation by indicators of energy status. S3 is TRUE: NAD+ availability is a critical determinant of TCA cycle rate because three of the eight cycle reactions require NAD+ as a substrate (isocitrate DH, alpha-KGDH, malate DH). NAD+ is regenerated by the ETC when it reoxidizes NADH. When the ETC is inhibited or saturated (all NAD+ converted to NADH), the TCA cycle cannot proceed. This creates tight coupling between the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. S4 is FALSE: Ca2+ activates ALL THREE regulatory enzymes — citrate synthase (indirectly, through increased OAA availability via isocitrate DH acceleration), isocitrate dehydrogenase (directly), and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (directly).

(3) Succinyl-CoA + GDP + Pi → succinate + GTP (succinyl-CoA synthetase in TCA cycle). No electron transport chain or proton gradient is required. S2 is TRUE: Of the approximately 30-32 ATP produced per glucose: substrate-level phosphorylation produces 4 ATP (2 from glycolysis + 2 GTP from TCA cycle) = approximately 12.5% of total. Oxidative phosphorylation produces approximately 26-28 ATP (from 10 NADH x 2.5 + 2 FADH2 x 1.5 = 28 ATP, minus some for shuttle costs) = approximately 87.5% of total.

NADPH is essential for reductive biosynthesis (fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, amino acid synthesis), glutathione reduction (GSH maintenance for ROS detoxification), and NADPH oxidase (phagocyte respiratory burst). (2) Ribose-5-phosphate — the sugar backbone for nucleotide synthesis (DNA, RNA, ATP, CoA, NAD+, FAD). S2 is TRUE: The oxidative branch (glucose-6-phosphate → 6-phosphogluconate → ribulose-5-phosphate + 2 CO2 + 2 NADPH) is irreversible and tightly regulated. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the committed step enzyme, is allosterically inhibited by NADPH (product feedback). When NADPH/NADP+ ratio is high (biosynthetic demand met), the oxidative PPP slows. When NADPH is consumed (e.g., active fatty acid synthesis or oxidative stress), NADP+ accumulates and G6PDH is activated. G6PDH deficiency is the most common human enzyme deficiency, causing hemolytic anemia upon oxidative stress. S3 is TRUE: The non-oxidative branch contains transketolase and transaldolase, which catalyze reversible reactions interconverting sugar phosphates of different chain lengths (C3-C7). This allows ribulose-5-phosphate to be converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate (glycolytic intermediates), connecting the PPP to glycolysis. S4 is FALSE: The PPP and glycolysis operate simultaneously and are interconnected through shared intermediates (G6P, F6P, GAP).

        "The high lactate levels are caused by dehydration, not a metabolic defect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The laboratory findings are classic for mitochondrial myopathy: (1) ELEVATED RESTING LACTATE (4.8 mmol/L vs. reference 0.5-1.5): Even at rest, the patient cannot generate sufficient ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, forcing compensatory glycolysis. The excess pyruvate is converted to lactate by LDH to regenerate NAD+. (2) EXAGGERATED EXERCISE RESPONSE: Mild exercise causes lactate to rise to 8.5 (vs. normal <2.5), and moderate exercise to 15.2 (vs. normal <5.0). During exercise, ATP demand increases dramatically. Normal individuals meet this demand primarily through increased oxidative phosphorylation. This patient's impaired ETC/OXPHOS forces even greater reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, producing proportionally more lactate. (3) DELAYED RECOVERY: 30 minutes after exercise, lactate remains at 9.5 (vs. normal <2.0). Lactate clearance occurs primarily through: (a) hepatic gluconeogenesis (Cori cycle), and (b) oxidation to pyruvate and then acetyl-CoA in muscle and heart. Both pathways require functional mitochondria, so the mitochondrial defect impairs recovery as well. The lactate/pyruvate ratio is typically elevated (>20, normal approximately 10), reflecting the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio from impaired ETC function. Common causes include Complex I deficiency (most common), Complex IV deficiency, CoQ10 deficiency, and mtDNA mutations. LDH deficiency would cause LESS lactate, not more (C). Simple dehydration would not cause this pattern (D).",

      "explanation": "These classic experiments with ionophores elegantly demonstrate the thermodynamic equivalence of the two pmf components. VALINOMYCIN (K+ ionophore): Makes the inner membrane permeable to K+. K+ flows down its concentration gradient into the matrix, carrying positive charge inward and collapsing delta-psi from -150 to -50 mV. However, the proton pumps continue working, and the lost electrical component is partially compensated by an increased delta-pH (from 0.5 to 1.5 pH units). The total pmf decreases but is not abolished (-139 mV), and ATP synthesis continues (albeit at reduced rate). This proves delta-pH alone can drive ATP synthesis. NIGERICIN (K+/H+ antiporter): Exchanges K+ for H+ across the membrane (electroneutral, no net charge transfer). K+ flows in while H+ flows out, collapsing delta-pH from 0.5 to 0.0. Since no net charge moves, delta-psi is not directly affected and actually increases to -210 mV (compensatory increase). The total pmf is well-maintained (-210 mV), and ATP synthesis continues efficiently. This proves delta-psi alone can drive ATP synthesis. FCCP (protonophore): Collapses BOTH components simultaneously (delta-psi = -20 mV, delta-pH = 0.1), abolishing pmf (-26 mV) and stopping ATP synthesis. KEY INSIGHT: The pmf is a single thermodynamic entity (delta-p = delta-psi - 59delta-pH at 25C). ATP synthase responds to the TOTAL pmf regardless of its composition. Neither component alone is irrelevant (D).",

Fluoroacetate is activated to fluoroacetyl-CoA, which condenses with oxaloacetate (via citrate synthase) to form fluorocitrate. Fluorocitrate is a potent competitive inhibitor of aconitase, blocking the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES: (1) CITRATE ACCUMULATION: Without aconitase activity, citrate builds up in the mitochondrial matrix. (2) TCA CYCLE ARREST: The cycle cannot proceed past the aconitase step, so no NADH or FADH2 is produced from subsequent reactions (isocitrate DH, alpha-KGDH, succinate DH, malate DH). (3) ETC AND OXPHOS FAILURE: Without NADH/FADH2, the ETC has no electron donors, ATP synthesis stops. (4) GLYCOLYTIC INHIBITION: Citrate exported to the cytoplasm inhibits PFK-1, slowing glycolysis — the only remaining ATP source. (5) CITRATE SYNTHASE INHIBITION: Accumulated citrate product-inhibits citrate synthase, creating a complete TCA cycle block. The combination of TCA cycle arrest and glycolytic inhibition causes fatal energy depletion within hours. Fluorocitrate does NOT stimulate the cycle (A) or target Complex IV (C).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2 to 2 H2O, one of the most challenging reactions in biology because partially reduced oxygen species (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical) are extremely toxic. The enzyme prevents their release through a carefully controlled mechanism at the binuclear center (heme a3 + CuB): STEP 1 (R→A): O2 binds to the reduced binuclear center (Fe2+-a3, Cu+B). STEP 2 (A→P): The O=O bond is cleaved in a concerted four-electron reduction. Two electrons come from Fe2+-a3 (oxidized to Fe4+=O, ferryl) and two from Cu+B and a nearby tyrosine residue (Tyr244 forms a radical). This produces the P (peroxy) intermediate with no free radical release. STEP 3 (P→F): One electron from cytochrome c (via CuA → heme a) reduces the tyrosine radical, forming the F (ferryl) state (Fe4+=O). One proton is taken up. STEP 4 (F→O): Another electron reduces the ferryl iron back to Fe3+, releasing H2O. The fully oxidized O state then accepts two more electrons to return to the reduced state for the next cycle. Crucially, all four electrons are transferred to oxygen before the binuclear center opens, preventing any partially reduced species from escaping. This is NOT a two-electron process (A). Proton transfer alone cannot reduce oxygen (C). Water production occurs at Complex IV, not III (D).",

(2) REDUCED LACTATE: Less pyruvate is available for LDH, decreasing lactate production. This is therapeutically useful in lactic acidosis (congenital or acquired).

In some cancers, this reactivation of mitochondrial metabolism can restore apoptotic signaling (which is suppressed when mitochondria are underutilized) and reduce tumor growth.

When succinate is the sole respiratory substrate: IMMEDIATE EFFECT: Malonate blocks succinate oxidation at Complex II, preventing FADH2 formation. No electrons enter the ubiquinone pool from Complex II. DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES: Without reduced ubiquinone (QH2), Complex III has no substrate. Without reduced cytochrome c, Complex IV has no substrate. Oxygen consumption stops completely. ENERGETIC CONSEQUENCES: Proton pumping ceases at Complexes III and IV. The proton gradient gradually dissipates through normal proton leak. ATP synthase stops when the pmf drops below the threshold for ATP synthesis. COMPETITION: Because malonate is a competitive inhibitor, its effect can be overcome by adding excess succinate (increasing [succinate]/[malonate] ratio). This was historically used to confirm the competitive nature of the inhibition. Malonate does NOT accelerate anything (A). It specifically inhibits Complex II, not Complex I (C).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Respiratory control is one of the most fundamental demonstrations of chemiosmotic coupling. In well-coupled mitochondria, the rate of oxygen consumption is tightly controlled by ADP availability through the proton gradient: STATE 4 (no ADP, resting): ATP synthase cannot operate without ADP as substrate. Protons pumped by the ETC accumulate in the IMS, increasing the pmf. As pmf rises, it becomes thermodynamically more costly for Complexes I, III, and IV to pump additional protons against the steeper gradient. Electron transport slows, and oxygen consumption decreases to a basal rate (mainly from proton leak). STATE 3 (ADP added, active): ADP + Pi enter the matrix (via ANT and PiC). ATP synthase binds ADP and catalyzes ATP synthesis, allowing protons to flow back through the Fo channel. This partially dissipates the pmf, reducing the back-pressure on the ETC. The ETC accelerates, pumping protons faster, consuming more O2. The respiratory control ratio (RCR = State 3 OCR/State 4 OCR) measures the tightness of coupling. A high RCR (typically 3-10) indicates well-coupled mitochondria. Damaged or uncoupled mitochondria have low RCR (approaching 1). ADP does NOT bind Complex IV (A). O2 does not regulate ADP production (C). ADP activates the overall system, it does not inhibit the ETC (D).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The total free energy available from NADH oxidation to O2 is -219 kJ/mol. Rather than releasing this energy in a single explosive step (which would largely be dissipated as heat), the ETC parcels it out through a series of thermodynamically favorable steps: Complex I (NADH → Q): delta-G approximately -69 kJ/mol (pumps 4 H+). Complex III (QH2 → cyt c): delta-G approximately -36 kJ/mol (pumps 4 H+ via Q-cycle). Complex IV (cyt c → O2): delta-G approximately -110 kJ/mol (pumps 2 H+, but also uses energy for the kinetically challenging O2 reduction). The energy released at each step is sufficient to pump protons against the approximately 200 mV gradient, but the stepwise approach allows more of the total energy to be captured productively. This is analogous to a hydroelectric dam releasing water through a series of turbines at different elevations, rather than letting it all fall at once. If the total energy were released in one step, most would be dissipated as heat (thermal energy), and only one proton-pumping site could be utilized. By distributing the energy across three pumping sites (Complexes I, III, IV), the cell captures approximately 10 protons per NADH, generating enough pmf for approximately 2.5 ATP. The later complexes ARE important (B). The delta-G at each step is negative (C). The stepwise design is an evolutionary optimization, not a flaw (D).",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) catalyzes: pyruvate + CO2 + ATP → oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi. This biotin-dependent enzyme is the most important anaplerotic reaction in mammalian cells. Its regulation by acetyl-CoA is a masterpiece of metabolic logic: WHEN ACETYL-CoA ACCUMULATES: This can occur when beta-oxidation is active (fasting, high-fat diet) or when amino acid catabolism generates acetyl-CoA. The excess acetyl-CoA needs OAA for entry into the TCA cycle via citrate synthase. However, OAA may be depleted because (a) it was consumed by citrate synthase, (b) it was diverted to gluconeogenesis (as PEP), or (c) other TCA intermediates were removed for biosynthesis (cataplerosis). Acetyl-CoA allosterically activates pyruvate carboxylase, stimulating OAA production from pyruvate. This ensures that sufficient OAA is available to condense with the acetyl-CoA and maintain TCA cycle flux. Without this activation, acetyl-CoA would accumulate and be diverted to ketone body synthesis (which does occur when OAA depletion is severe, as in uncontrolled diabetes). STRUCTURAL MECHANISM: Acetyl-CoA binds to the allosteric domain of PC, promoting the proper positioning of the biotin carrier between the BC (biotin carboxylase) and CT (carboxyl transferase) active sites. Without acetyl-CoA, biotin cannot efficiently shuttle between the two active sites. AMP does not activate PC (A). PC requires allosteric activation (C). NADH does not directly regulate PC (D).",

On FERMENTABLE substrates (glucose): Yeast primarily uses fermentation, producing ethanol and CO2. Even without functional OXPHOS, yeast grows robustly on glucose through glycolysis alone (the Crabtree effect). Therefore, oligomycin has minimal effect on glucose growth in wild-type yeast, and the resistant strain also grows fine. On NON-FERMENTABLE substrates (glycerol, ethanol, lactate): Yeast MUST use mitochondrial respiration because these substrates cannot be fermented. Wild-type yeast in the presence of oligomycin cannot grow on non-fermentable substrates because ATP synthase is blocked. However, yeast carrying the oligomycin-resistant ATP synthase mutation (typically in the Fo c-subunit, which is encoded by mitochondrial DNA) can grow because their ATP synthase functions normally despite oligomycin. This makes oligomycin resistance a selectable marker for mitochondrial genetics. The strain CAN grow on all carbon sources (A is wrong).

While some of the oxygen in CO2 comes from the original glucose, much of it comes from WATER.

S3 is TRUE: Tracking the 12 pairs of hydrogen atoms (24 total H atoms) from glucose: Glycolysis produces 2 NADH (at GAPDH), pyruvate oxidation produces 2 NADH, and the TCA cycle produces 6 NADH + 2 FADH2. Total: 10 NADH + 2 FADH2, carrying 24 hydrogen equivalents. S4 is TRUE: Molecular oxygen (O2) serves as the terminal electron acceptor of the ETC, being reduced to H2O at the binuclear center of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase): O2 + 4e- + 4H+ → 2H2O.

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The Cori cycle (Carl and Gerty Cori, 1947) describes the metabolic cooperation between muscle and liver: exercising muscle converts glucose to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis, producing 2 ATP per glucose). Lactate is exported to blood and taken up by the liver, where gluconeogenesis converts it back to glucose (consuming 6 ATP equivalents per glucose). The glucose is released into the blood and can return to muscle. S2 is FALSE: The Cori cycle is NOT energy-neutral — it is energy-expensive. Muscle glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose, but hepatic gluconeogenesis consumes 6 ATP equivalents (4 ATP + 2 GTP) per glucose synthesized from 2 lactate. This represents a net cost of 4 ATP equivalents per cycle, paid for by the liver's oxidative metabolism (fatty acid oxidation). The Cori cycle effectively transfers the metabolic burden of lactate recycling from muscle (which cannot perform gluconeogenesis) to the liver (which has the necessary enzymes and can generate ATP from fat oxidation even while performing gluconeogenesis). S3 is TRUE: Hepatic gluconeogenesis is activated by glucagon (during fasting) and epinephrine (during exercise). Glucagon activates cAMP-PKA signaling, which: (1) phosphorylates PFK-2, lowering F-2,6-BP, inhibiting glycolysis and activating gluconeogenesis; (2) induces transcription of PEPCK and G6Pase genes (via CREB). S4 is TRUE: Lactate crosses cell membranes via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1-MCT4), which are H+/lactate symporters. MCT4 (high Km) mediates lactate export from glycolytic muscle. MCT1 (low Km) mediates lactate uptake by liver, heart, and oxidative muscle fibers.",

This happens during: (1) Prolonged fasting (high beta-oxidation, OAA diverted to gluconeogenesis). (2) Uncontrolled diabetes (high fatty acid mobilization from adipose, elevated beta-oxidation). (3) High-fat/low-carbohydrate diets. The pathway: 2 acetyl-CoA → acetoacetyl-CoA (thiolase) → HMG-CoA (HMG-CoA synthase) → acetoacetate + acetyl-CoA (HMG-CoA lyase). Acetoacetate can be reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate (by beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) or spontaneously decarboxylated to acetone. S2 is TRUE: Under normal conditions, the brain uses glucose exclusively (approximately 120 g/day). However, during prolonged fasting (>3-4 days), the brain adapts to use ketone bodies as a major fuel source, eventually deriving up to 60-75% of its energy from acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. This adaptation is crucial for survival because it reduces the rate of gluconeogenesis (and therefore muscle protein breakdown to supply amino acid precursors for glucose synthesis). S3 is FALSE: Ketone bodies are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, not directly from fatty acids. Fatty acids must first undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which is then the substrate for ketogenesis. This distinction is important because not all acetyl-CoA comes from fatty acids — amino acid catabolism can also contribute. S4 is TRUE: The liver lacks succinyl-CoA:acetoacetate-CoA transferase (also called thiophorase or SCOT), the enzyme that activates acetoacetate for oxidation in extrahepatic tissues (by converting acetoacetate + succinyl-CoA → acetoacetyl-CoA + succinate). This enzyme's absence in liver ensures that the liver exports ketone bodies rather than oxidizing them, directing this fuel to other tissues (brain, heart, muscle, kidney).",

      "explanation": "These metabolomics data paint a comprehensive picture of cancer metabolic reprogramming: (1) WARBURG EFFECT: 8.5-fold increased glucose uptake and 12-fold increased lactate secretion confirm aerobic glycolysis. Cancer cells consume much more glucose than normal cells but convert most of it to lactate rather than oxidizing it completely. (2) GLUTAMINE ADDICTION: 5-fold increased glutamine uptake reflects the cancer cell's reliance on glutaminolysis — glutamine is deaminated to glutamate (by glutaminase), then to alpha-ketoglutarate (by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminases), which enters the TCA cycle as an anaplerotic substrate. Glutamine also provides nitrogen for nucleotide synthesis and amino acid biosynthesis. (3) LIPOGENESIS: 3.5-fold elevated intracellular citrate suggests the citrate shuttle is actively exporting citrate from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, where ATP-citrate lyase generates acetyl-CoA for de novo fatty acid synthesis — essential for the rapid membrane production needed by proliferating cells. (4) NITROGEN DISPOSAL: 4-fold increased alanine secretion indicates that excess nitrogen from glutaminolysis is being exported via transamination (pyruvate + glutamate → alanine + alpha-KG), preventing toxic ammonia accumulation. (5) PPP UPREGULATION: Elevated NADPH/NADP+ ratio and ribose-5-phosphate confirm increased pentose phosphate pathway flux, providing NADPH for biosynthetic reductions and glutathione maintenance (handling increased oxidative stress) and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis (needed for DNA replication in rapidly dividing cells). Cancer cells are NOT metabolically inactive (A) — they are hyperactive. Elevated lactate does NOT prove mitochondria are defective (C) — most cancer cells maintain functional mitochondria for biosynthesis and glutaminolysis. The differences ARE significant (D).",

This pattern is diagnostic of a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis rather than a structural gene mutation. KEY INSIGHT: Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) is unique among ETC complexes because ALL FOUR of its subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) are encoded by nuclear DNA and translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Complexes I, III, IV, and V each contain subunits encoded by both nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA: Complex I has 7 mtDNA-encoded subunits (ND1-ND6, ND4L). Complex III has 1 mtDNA-encoded subunit (cytochrome b). Complex IV has 3 mtDNA-encoded subunits (COX I, II, III). Complex V has 2 mtDNA-encoded subunits (ATP6, ATP8). When mitochondrial translation is globally impaired (e.g., by a tRNA mutation), all complexes with mtDNA-encoded subunits are deficient, but Complex II is spared. MELAS is most commonly caused by the m.3243A>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene encoding mitochondrial tRNA-Leucine (UUR). This single nucleotide change impairs tRNA charging and/or codon recognition, reducing the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis and decreasing the production of all mtDNA-encoded proteins. Option A incorrectly identifies only Complex I. Complex II IS normal, not deficient (D). Not all complexes are equally affected (C).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Reverse electron transport (RET) is now recognized as the major source of mitochondrial ROS in many physiological and pathological conditions. MECHANISM: When succinate is the sole substrate, Complex II reduces the ubiquinone pool to a high QH2/Q ratio. The high pmf generated (since all electrons enter at the ubiquinone level and pass through Complexes III and IV) creates conditions where it is thermodynamically favorable for electrons to flow backward from QH2 through Complex I — from QH2 to the NADH/NAD+ couple. This reverse electron transfer through Complex I generates large amounts of superoxide, primarily at the FMN site of Complex I. KEY EVIDENCE: (1) Succinate alone → 3.5x ROS: High QH2/Q and pmf drive reverse electron flow through Complex I → massive superoxide production. (2) Succinate + rotenone → 0.8x ROS: Rotenone blocks Complex I, preventing reverse electron flow. ROS drops dramatically, confirming that Complex I (via RET) is the major source, not Complex II itself. (3) Glutamate/malate + succinate → 0.6x ROS: Forward electron flow from NADH (glutamate/malate) through Complex I counteracts reverse flow. NADH at the FMN site keeps it in the forward mode, preventing RET-induced superoxide generation. The improved OCR and ATP rate (155% and 170%) reflect converging electron flow from both Complex I and II. Succinate is not inherently toxic (A). This is not an artifact (C). Complex II produces minimal ROS directly (D) — the major source is Complex I via RET.",

The modern structural approach: STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION: High-resolution structures (X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM) of the c-ring of Fo from various organisms reveal the number of c-subunits: yeast (10), E. coli (10), bovine mitochondria (8), chloroplasts (14), thermoalkaliphilic bacteria (13). CALCULATION: Each proton flowing through the Fo channel interacts with one c-subunit, driving a small rotational step. One complete 360-degree rotation of the c-ring requires n protons (where n = number of c-subunits). This same rotation drives three 120-degree conformational cycles in F1, synthesizing 3 ATP. Therefore: H+/ATP for synthesis = n/3. For bovine (mammalian) mitochondria: 8/3 = 2.67 H+ per ATP. For yeast: 10/3 = 3.33 H+ per ATP. TRANSPORT COSTS: Additionally, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) consumes approximately 0.33 H+ equivalent per ATP (electrogenic exchange), and the phosphate carrier consumes approximately 0.33 H+ per Pi imported (H+ symport). Total: approximately 2.67 + 0.67 = 3.33 H+ per ATP in mammalian mitochondria (often rounded to approximately 4 for the complete process including all transport). This structural approach is more reliable than earlier biochemical measurements, which gave conflicting results. pH alone (B) cannot determine stoichiometry. Sequence alone (C) is insufficient.

The mechanism: STEP 1: The active-site cysteine (Cys-149) attacks the aldehyde group of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, forming a hemithioacetal intermediate. STEP 2: NAD+ oxidizes the hemithioacetal to a thioester (enzyme-S-CO-CHOH-CH2OPO3^2-), producing NADH + H+. The thioester bond is a high-energy bond (delta-G of hydrolysis approximately -31 kJ/mol). STEP 3: Inorganic phosphate (Pi) attacks the thioester carbonyl carbon in a phosphorolysis reaction, displacing the enzyme cysteine thiolate and forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). The mixed anhydride (acyl phosphate) bond of 1,3-BPG retains the energy from the oxidation reaction. The brilliance of this mechanism is that the oxidation energy is NOT lost as heat — it is trapped first as a high-energy thioester and then transferred to the acyl phosphate of 1,3-BPG. This acyl phosphate has sufficient phosphoryl transfer potential (-49.4 kJ/mol) to drive ATP synthesis at the next step (phosphoglycerate kinase). GAPDH does NOT use ATP (A).

(2) Glutamate transfers its amino group to pyruvate (from glycolysis or amino acid catabolism) via alanine aminotransferase (ALT): glutamate + pyruvate → alanine + alpha-ketoglutarate. (3) Alanine is exported to the blood. IN LIVER: (1) Hepatic ALT reconverts alanine to pyruvate + glutamate. (2) Pyruvate enters gluconeogenesis to form glucose, which is released to blood and returns to muscle. (3) Glutamate is deaminated (glutamate dehydrogenase) or transaminated, and the amino group is channeled to urea synthesis for excretion. DUAL FUNCTION: The glucose-alanine cycle simultaneously: (1) Transports glucose-carbon from liver to muscle and back. (2) Transports amino nitrogen from muscle to liver for safe disposal via urea synthesis (muscle lacks a complete urea cycle). Leucine is ketogenic, NOT glucogenic (A). Glutamine IS a major carrier of nitrogen from muscle and is also gluconeogenic, but the question asks about the PRIMARY substrate — alanine accounts for approximately 30% of amino acids released from muscle during fasting (C overstates glutamine's exclusive role). Tryptophan content is irrelevant (D).",

        "Anaerobic respiration uses an electron transport chain and proton-motive force for ATP synthesis (like aerobic respiration) but substitutes alternative terminal electron acceptors such as nitrate (NO3- → NO2-), sulfate (SO4^2- → H2S), Fe3+ (→ Fe2+), or fumarate (→ succinate) — the ATP yield is typically less than aerobic respiration because these acceptors have lower reduction potentials than O2, providing less free energy for proton pumping",

        "Anaerobic respiration cannot produce ATP because there is no electron acceptor available",
        "Only eukaryotic organisms can perform anaerobic respiration"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Anaerobic respiration is fundamentally different from fermentation. Like aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration uses an electron transport chain embedded in the membrane, generates a proton-motive force, and synthesizes ATP via ATP synthase (chemiosmosis). The key difference is the terminal electron acceptor: AEROBIC: O2 (E'0 = +816 mV) → H2O. Maximum energy yield. ANAEROBIC ALTERNATIVES: Denitrification: NO3- (E'0 = +421 mV) → NO2- → NO → N2O → N2 (Pseudomonas, Paracoccus). Sulfate reduction: SO4^2- (E'0 = -217 mV) → H2S (Desulfovibrio). Iron reduction: Fe3+ (E'0 approximately +770 mV at acidic pH) → Fe2+ (Geobacter, Shewanella). Fumarate reduction: fumarate (E'0 = +30 mV) → succinate (many bacteria). Methanogenesis: CO2 (E'0 = -244 mV) → CH4 (methanogenic archaea). Since these acceptors have lower reduction potentials than O2, the total delta-E'0 (and therefore delta-G) for electron transfer from NADH is less, yielding fewer protons pumped and less ATP per electron pair. Anaerobic respiration IS different from fermentation (A) — fermentation uses no ETC or pmf. ATP IS produced via chemiosmosis (C). Anaerobic respiration is primarily a prokaryotic process, though some eukaryotic parasites use fumarate respiration (D).",

      "options": [
        "The actual cellular delta-G is negative because the products (GAP and DHAP) are rapidly consumed by downstream reactions — GAP is used by GAPDH (reaction 6) and DHAP is rapidly converted to GAP by triose phosphate isomerase; this keeps the mass action ratio (Q = [GAP][DHAP]/[F-1,6-BP]) far below the equilibrium constant, making the actual delta-G sufficiently negative for the reaction to proceed",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "This is a classic illustration of the difference between standard free energy change (delta-G-zero-prime) and actual free energy change (delta-G) under cellular conditions. The relationship is: delta-G = delta-G-zero-prime + RT ln Q, where Q = [products]/[reactants]. For the aldolase reaction: delta-G-zero-prime = +23.8 kJ/mol (endergonic under standard conditions). However, in the cell, the products GAP and DHAP are maintained at very low concentrations because: (1) GAP is rapidly consumed by GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, reaction 6) — a highly exergonic coupled oxidation-phosphorylation. (2) DHAP is rapidly converted to GAP by triose phosphate isomerase (one of the most catalytically efficient enzymes known, kcat/Km approaching the diffusion limit). (3) The substrate F-1,6-BP is maintained at relatively high concentration. The resulting mass action ratio Q is extremely small (far below Keq), making the RT ln Q term large and negative (approximately -37 kJ/mol or more). Therefore: actual delta-G = +23.8 + (-37) = approximately -13 kJ/mol (exergonic). This principle applies to many near-equilibrium reactions in metabolic pathways — they are pulled forward by the continuous removal of products. No ATP is needed for this reaction (A). The reaction does proceed forward in glycolysis (C). No internal energy source is generated (D).",

Enolase is a metalloenzyme that requires two Mg2+ ions at its active site. One Mg2+ coordinates the carboxylate group of the substrate, while the second Mg2+ stabilizes the enolate intermediate. Fluoride inhibits enolase by forming a complex with Mg2+ and inorganic phosphate: Mg2+-F--Pi complex at the active site, which blocks substrate binding. CLINICAL APPLICATION: After blood is drawn, red blood cells (which rely entirely on glycolysis for ATP since they lack mitochondria) continue to consume glucose, potentially lowering the measured glucose concentration and giving a falsely low result. NaF (sodium fluoride) in blood collection tubes (gray-top tubes) inhibits enolase, stopping glycolysis and preserving the in vivo glucose concentration for accurate clinical measurement. Fluoride also has applications in dentistry — it inhibits enolase in oral bacteria, reducing their ability to metabolize sugars and produce the lactic acid that causes tooth decay.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "In pancreatic beta cells, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) depends critically on the ATP/ADP ratio: glucose metabolism → increased ATP/ADP ratio → KATP channel closure → membrane depolarization → Ca2+ influx → insulin granule exocytosis. UCP2 partially uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in beta cells, reducing the ATP generated per glucose molecule metabolized. This lowers the ATP/ADP ratio increase in response to glucose, resulting in reduced KATP channel closure and attenuated insulin secretion. UCP2 therefore acts as a NEGATIVE REGULATOR of insulin secretion, providing a brake that prevents hypoglycemia from excessive insulin release. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: (1) UCP2 overexpression (e.g., in obesity or chronic hyperglycemia) reduces GSIS and contributes to beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. (2) UCP2 knockout mice show enhanced GSIS and improved glucose tolerance. (3) Superoxide activates UCP2, and chronic ROS from nutrient excess may increase UCP2-mediated uncoupling, contributing to glucotoxicity in diabetes. (4) The common UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism affects UCP2 expression and is associated with type 2 diabetes risk in some populations. UCP2 DECREASES, not increases, ATP and insulin (A).

        "The enzyme uses ATP to drive the reaction forward",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The malate dehydrogenase reaction has one of the most unfavorable delta-G-zero-prime values of any reaction in central metabolism (+29.7 kJ/mol). Yet it proceeds forward in the TCA cycle for a remarkable reason: citrate synthase, the next enzyme in the cycle, pulls it forward. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS: delta-G = delta-G-zero-prime + RT ln ([OAA][NADH]/[malate][NAD+]). For the reaction to proceed forward (delta-G < 0), the mass action ratio must be extremely low. This is achieved because: (1) Citrate synthase has a very large negative delta-G-zero-prime (-32.2 kJ/mol) and rapidly consumes OAA as soon as it is produced. This maintains [OAA] at approximately 1-10 micromolar — among the lowest metabolite concentrations in the cell. (2) The NAD+/NADH ratio in the mitochondrial matrix is maintained high (approximately 7-10) by the ETC's continuous reoxidation of NADH. (3) Malate is maintained at higher concentrations (approximately 0.1-1 mM). Together, these factors make RT ln Q approximately -35 to -40 kJ/mol, giving actual delta-G approximately +29.7 + (-37) = approximately -7 kJ/mol (exergonic). This is a prime example of how metabolic pathways function as integrated systems — individual reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable are driven forward by subsequent highly exergonic reactions. No ATP is consumed (A). The enzyme operates forward (C). The delta-G-zero-prime IS positive; it is the actual delta-G that is negative (D).",

ANT is the most abundant protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane (approximately 10% of total inner membrane protein). It alternates between two conformational states: c-state (cytoplasmic-facing, accessible from IMS) and m-state (matrix-facing, accessible from matrix). Atractyloside locks ANT in the c-state, while bongkrekic acid (another ANT inhibitor, from contaminated coconut/corn products in Southeast Asia) locks it in the m-state. CONSEQUENCES of ANT inhibition: (1) ADP cannot enter the matrix → ATP synthase has no substrate → ATP synthesis stops. (2) Matrix ATP cannot exit → cytoplasmic ATP depletes rapidly. (3) Without ADP recycling, State 4-like conditions develop: pmf builds up, ETC slows (respiratory control).

As exercise intensity increases above the lactate threshold (approximately 65-85% VO2max), the contribution shifts toward carbohydrate (glycogen and glucose), reaching nearly 100% during maximal anaerobic exercise. This crossover concept reflects the limitations of fatty acid oxidation rate (slower maximal flux compared to glycolysis) and the recruitment of fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers that rely more on glycolysis. S2 is TRUE: RER reflects the stoichiometry of oxidation. For glucose: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O; RER = 6CO2/6O2 = 1.0. For palmitate: C16H32O2 + 23O2 → 16CO2 + 16H2O; RER = 16CO2/23O2 = 0.70. Mixed fuel oxidation gives intermediate RER values (typically 0.80-0.85 at rest). RER > 1.0 during intense exercise indicates anaerobic metabolism (excess CO2 from bicarbonate buffering of lactic acid). S3 is FALSE: AMPK activation during exercise INHIBITS fatty acid synthesis (by phosphorylating and inactivating acetyl-CoA carboxylase/ACC, lowering malonyl-CoA) while STIMULATING fatty acid oxidation (lower malonyl-CoA relieves CPT-I inhibition). These are reciprocal, not simultaneous — AMPK ensures that the cell oxidizes fat for energy rather than synthesizing it during energy stress.

S2 is TRUE: In yeast, the Crabtree effect involves glucose repression — a signal transduction pathway where high glucose activates signaling cascades (Ras-cAMP-PKA and others) that repress transcription of nuclear genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory function.

This transcriptional regulation takes hours to fully develop, while the immediate metabolic shift occurs within minutes (via allosteric regulation of glycolytic and respiratory enzymes). S3 is FALSE: The Crabtree effect and Pasteur effect are OPPOSITE phenomena.

Their actual mass action ratios (Q) are far below their equilibrium constants (Keq). These reactions are essentially irreversible under physiological conditions and their flux is determined by the AMOUNT AND ACTIVITY of the enzyme (KINETIC CONTROL). This is where allosteric regulation, covalent modification, and transcriptional regulation are concentrated. PFK-1 is regulated by ATP (inhibitor), AMP (activator), citrate (inhibitor), and F-2,6-BP (activator). These three reactions cannot be simply reversed for gluconeogenesis — separate bypass enzymes are required. NEAR-EQUILIBRIUM (REVERSIBLE) REACTIONS: The seven reactions with delta-G approximately 0 operate near equilibrium (Q approximately Keq). Their flux is determined by the concentrations of substrates and products (THERMODYNAMIC CONTROL via mass action). They are NOT primary regulatory targets because: (1) they respond passively to changes in metabolite concentrations, and (2) they operate in both directions depending on pathway demand (shared between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis).

      "explanation": "The dramatic difference in NAD+/NADH ratios between cytoplasm and mitochondria reflects the distinct metabolic functions of each compartment and is maintained by the impermeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to pyridine nucleotides. CYTOPLASM (NAD+/NADH approximately 700:1, highly oxidized): The high NAD+/NADH ratio ensures that: (1) GAPDH has abundant NAD+ to oxidize glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (essential for glycolysis to proceed). (2) Lactate dehydrogenase operates in the direction of pyruvate → lactate when needed (regenerating NAD+ under anaerobic conditions). (3) Cytoplasmic dehydrogenases that require NAD+ as electron acceptor have ample oxidized cofactor. The ratio is maintained by the shuttle systems (malate-aspartate, glycerol-3-phosphate) that transfer reducing equivalents to mitochondria, and by LDH during anaerobic conditions. MITOCHONDRIAL MATRIX (NAD+/NADH approximately 7:1, more reduced): The lower ratio reflects the continuous production of NADH by: (1) PDC (pyruvate → acetyl-CoA + NADH). (2) Three NADH-producing TCA cycle reactions. (3) Beta-oxidation. NADH is consumed by Complex I but the rate of production matches consumption at steady state. The ratio also provides thermodynamic driving force for the TCA cycle dehydrogenases. MEMBRANE IMPERMEABILITY: NAD+ and NADH cannot cross the inner membrane, so the two pools are independently regulated.

(2) A fluorescent actin filament (approximately 1-3 micrometers long) is attached to the gamma subunit (the rotor) via a streptavidin-biotin linkage. (3) ATP is added to the solution (running F1 in reverse — as an ATPase rather than synthase). (4) Using an epifluorescence or darkfield microscope, the actin filament is observed rotating counterclockwise (viewed from the membrane side). KEY OBSERVATIONS: (1) DISCRETE 120-DEGREE STEPS: At low ATP concentrations, the rotation occurs in three distinct 120-degree jumps per revolution, corresponding to the three catalytic sites. Each step requires one ATP molecule. (2) CONTINUOUS ROTATION at high ATP: At saturating ATP, the filament rotates smoothly (too fast to resolve individual steps). (3) SINGLE-MOLECULE EXPERIMENT: Individual F1 complexes can be observed, confirming that rotation is an intrinsic property of single molecules. (4) TORQUE MEASUREMENTS: By varying the actin filament length (and thus the viscous drag), researchers calculated that each 120-degree step generates approximately 40 pN*nm of torque — close to the free energy of ATP hydrolysis, indicating near-100% mechanochemical efficiency. This experiment directly and unambiguously demonstrated rotational catalysis. Temperature studies (A) are indirect. Crystal structures (C) show static snapshots. pH measurements (D) are indirect.",

      "explanation": "Mitochondrial dynamics — the balance between fusion and fission — is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and is regulated by opposing families of dynamin-related GTPases: FISSION MACHINERY: Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1): A cytosolic GTPase recruited to mitochondria by receptor proteins (Mff, MiD49/51, Fis1). It oligomerizes into a ring around the mitochondrion and uses GTP hydrolysis to constrict and sever the membranes. FUSION MACHINERY: Outer membrane: Mfn1 and Mfn2 (mitofusins) — GTPases that tether and fuse outer membranes of adjacent mitochondria via trans-homo/heterotypic interactions. Inner membrane: OPA1 (optic atrophy protein 1) — a GTPase that mediates inner membrane fusion and cristae remodeling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Fragmented mitochondria: (1) Overexpress Drp1 (increases fission rate) or (2) Knockout Mfn1/Mfn2 or OPA1 (blocks fusion). Either approach shifts the balance toward fission, producing small, fragmented mitochondria. Hyperfused mitochondria: (1) Knockout Drp1 (blocks fission) or (2) Overexpress Mfn1/Mfn2 (increases fusion). Either shifts toward fusion, producing elongated, interconnected mitochondrial networks. FUNCTIONAL READOUTS: Compare OXPHOS capacity (OCR), membrane potential (TMRM staining), mtDNA distribution (FISH), cristae morphology (EM), ROS production, and susceptibility to apoptosis. Research shows fragmented mitochondria often have reduced OXPHOS efficiency and increased ROS, while moderate fusion improves respiratory function through content mixing and complementation.

They provide an alternative proton return pathway. Therefore: (1) In normal mitochondria: OCR increases (ETC accelerates because pmf is dissipated) while ATP decreases (pmf cannot drive ATP synthase). (2) After oligomycin treatment: Oligomycin blocks the Fo proton channel, so OCR drops to State 4 levels. Adding a TRUE uncoupler after oligomycin RESTORES high OCR because protons flow through the uncoupler instead of the blocked ATP synthase — the ETC is freed from back-pressure. COMBINATION (ETC stimulant + ATP synthase inhibitor): This might mimic uncoupling in normal mitochondria (increased OCR, decreased ATP). However, after oligomycin: Adding this combination would NOT restore OCR because the ATP synthase inhibitor component does not provide an alternative proton path. The ETC stimulant cannot overcome the thermodynamic back-pressure of the accumulated pmf. ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION: Measure membrane potential — a true uncoupler would collapse delta-psi (measurable by TMRM or safranine O), while a stimulant/inhibitor combination would maintain or increase delta-psi.

The RBC also produces 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) via the Rapoport-Luebering shunt, which regulates hemoglobin oxygen affinity. The ADAPTATIVE LOGIC: (1) Maximizes hemoglobin content — more space for Hb (approximately 270 million Hb molecules per RBC at approximately 34 g/dL). (2) Prevents self-consumption of O2 — if RBCs had mitochondria, they would consume some of the O2 they carry. (3) Eliminates ROS production from the ETC — reducing oxidative damage to Hb (though RBCs still need antioxidant defense via NADPH from the PPP and glutathione). CONSEQUENCES: (1) Entirely dependent on blood glucose. (2) Cannot oxidize fatty acids or amino acids. (3) Export lactate (contributes to the Cori cycle).

      "explanation": "The Randle cycle (Philip Randle, 1963) describes how increased fatty acid availability and oxidation inhibits glucose utilization through a cascade of allosteric and metabolic signals: STEP 1 (Mitochondria): Increased beta-oxidation produces excess acetyl-CoA and NADH. High acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio activates PDH kinase (PDK), which phosphorylates and inactivates PDC, reducing pyruvate → acetyl-CoA flux. High NADH/NAD+ ratio further inhibits PDC and slows TCA cycle dehydrogenases. STEP 2 (Mitochondria → Cytoplasm): Acetyl-CoA that cannot enter the TCA cycle (already saturated) is exported as citrate via the citrate shuttle. Elevated cytoplasmic citrate inhibits PFK-1, the committed step of glycolysis. STEP 3 (Cytoplasm): Reduced PFK-1 activity causes fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate to accumulate. High G6P inhibits hexokinase I (product inhibition), reducing glucose phosphorylation. STEP 4 (Plasma membrane): Reduced glucose phosphorylation leads to glucose accumulation inside the cell, which reduces the concentration gradient driving glucose uptake via GLUT transporters. NET EFFECT: Fuel preference shifts from glucose to fatty acids. This is physiologically important during fasting, when fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue should be the primary fuel, sparing glucose for the brain. Fatty acids do not directly inhibit glucose transporters (A). The competition is indirect, not physical (C). NAD+ is not completely depleted (D).",

Total pmf approximately 200-220 mV. The dominance of delta-psi reflects the inner membrane's low permeability to all ions, maintaining a large charge gradient. CHLOROPLASTS: delta-pH approximately 3 units (approximately 180 mV equivalent, dominant). delta-psi approximately 10-30 mV (minor). Total pmf approximately 200 mV. The dominance of delta-pH reflects the thylakoid membrane's relatively higher permeability to ions (especially K+ and Cl-), which flow to compensate for charge buildup. As protons accumulate in the lumen, K+ flows out and Cl- flows in, partially dissipating the electrical potential but not the chemical potential (pH gradient). Despite the different compositions, the total pmf values are remarkably similar (approximately 200 mV in both), and both drive their respective ATP synthases at similar rates.

At this site, ATP serves as the phosphoryl group donor for the reaction: fructose-6-phosphate + ATP → fructose-1,6-bisphosphate + ADP. This site is always essentially saturated at physiological [ATP]. ALLOSTERIC (REGULATORY) SITE: A separate inhibitory site binds free ATP4- (not Mg-complexed) with lower affinity (Ki approximately 1-5 mM).

The net effect is that PFK-1 activity is modulated by the interplay between: (1) ATP at the catalytic site (substrate — always available). (2) ATP at the regulatory site (inhibitor — sensitive to [ATP] changes). (3) Counterregulatory activators: AMP and F-2,6-BP bind their own allosteric sites and oppose ATP inhibition by shifting PFK-1 toward the R state. AMP competes with ATP at the regulatory site. F-2,6-BP increases the enzyme's affinity for F6P dramatically. This is NOT a contradiction (A). ATP DOES inhibit PFK-1 (C). The inhibition IS physiologically relevant (D).",

      "options": [
        "The Rapoport-Luebering shunt diverts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG (via bisphosphoglycerate mutase) instead of generating ATP at phosphoglycerate kinase — 2,3-BPG binds hemoglobin and decreases its oxygen affinity (right-shifts the oxygen dissociation curve), facilitating O2 release to tissues; this means RBCs sacrifice 1 ATP per glucose diverted to produce a critical regulator of oxygen delivery",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Rapoport-Luebering shunt is a unique branch of glycolysis in red blood cells: NORMAL GLYCOLYSIS: 1,3-BPG → 3-PG + ATP (phosphoglycerate kinase). SHUNT PATHWAY: 1,3-BPG → 2,3-BPG (bisphosphoglycerate mutase) → 3-PG (2,3-BPG phosphatase). The shunt BYPASSES the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction, meaning the high-energy acyl phosphate of 1,3-BPG is wasted (hydrolyzed without ATP production) rather than used for substrate-level phosphorylation. The RBC sacrifices 1 ATP per glucose diverted through this shunt. 2,3-BPG FUNCTION: At approximately 5 mM in RBCs (equimolar with hemoglobin), 2,3-BPG binds in the central cavity of deoxyhemoglobin (between the two beta subunits), stabilizing the T (tense/deoxy) state. This decreases hemoglobin's O2 affinity (increases P50 from approximately 1 mmHg to approximately 26 mmHg), right-shifting the oxygen dissociation curve and promoting O2 release to tissues. Without 2,3-BPG, hemoglobin would bind O2 too tightly to release it efficiently at the partial pressures found in peripheral tissues. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Stored blood gradually loses 2,3-BPG, reducing its oxygen-delivering capacity. Certain anemias, high altitude adaptation, and thyroid hormone levels affect 2,3-BPG levels. The shunt IS unique to RBC glycolysis (A). 2,3-BPG is primarily in RBCs (C). NADPH is produced by the PPP, not the 2,3-BPG shunt (D).",

      "explanation": "S1 is TRUE: The malate-aspartate shuttle transfers the reducing equivalents of cytoplasmic NADH (produced by GAPDH in glycolysis) to the mitochondrial matrix, where they regenerate NADH for Complex I. The cytoplasmic reaction: OAA + NADH → malate + NAD+ (cytoplasmic malate DH). Malate enters the matrix. The matrix reaction: malate + NAD+ → OAA + NADH (mitochondrial malate DH). Net effect: cytoplasmic NADH → matrix NADH (preserved reducing power, P/O = 2.5). S2 is TRUE: Two antiporters on the inner membrane are essential: (1) Malate/alpha-ketoglutarate antiporter: Imports malate in exchange for alpha-KG. (2) Glutamate/aspartate antiporter: Imports glutamate in exchange for aspartate. These carriers move the substrates needed to complete the shuttle cycle. S3 is TRUE: The shuttle is thermodynamically reversible. Under certain conditions (e.g., gluconeogenesis in liver where cytoplasmic NADH is needed for the GAPDH reaction running in reverse), the shuttle can operate in the reverse direction, transferring reducing equivalents from the matrix to the cytoplasm. The direction depends on the NADH/NAD+ ratios in the two compartments. S4 is FALSE: The glutamate/aspartate antiporter is an ELECTROGENIC transport — it exchanges glutamate (charge -1) for aspartate (charge -1) plus a proton, effectively exporting one negative charge from the matrix. This antiport is driven by the membrane potential (delta-psi, matrix negative), meaning the shuttle consumes part of the proton-motive force. The malate/alpha-KG exchange is electroneutral but is also driven by concentration gradients that are ultimately maintained by the pmf.",

No fermentation products. (2) As glucose increases from 0.1 to 50 mM: OCR progressively DECREASES (100 → 15, an 85% reduction). Ethanol production progressively INCREASES (0 → 100). (3) At high glucose (>20 mM): OCR reaches a minimum plateau and ethanol production is maximal, indicating nearly complete metabolic shift to fermentation. MECHANISM: The Crabtree effect involves multiple levels of regulation: (a) IMMEDIATE (minutes): High glycolytic flux saturates mitochondrial pyruvate processing capacity, diverting pyruvate to ethanol production. The rapid NADH production by glycolysis may also reduce the NAD+/NADH ratio, limiting respiratory capacity. (b) SHORT-TERM (hours): Glucose-activated signaling pathways (Ras-cAMP-PKA, Snf1/AMPK-related) repress transcription of respiratory genes. (c) LONG-TERM (generations): Mitochondrial biogenesis is reduced, decreasing mitochondrial volume and respiratory capacity.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Glutamate catabolism for energy involves deamination followed by oxidation through the TCA cycle: STEP 1 — DEAMINATION: Glutamate + NAD+ + H2O → alpha-ketoglutarate + NH4+ + NADH (glutamate dehydrogenase, in mitochondrial matrix). This produces 1 NADH → 2.5 ATP. STEP 2 — TCA CYCLE (from alpha-KG onward, 4 remaining reactions): (1) Alpha-KGDH: alpha-KG + NAD+ + CoA → succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH → 2.5 ATP. (2) Succinyl-CoA synthetase: succinyl-CoA + GDP + Pi → succinate + GTP + CoA → 1.0 ATP equivalent. (3) SDH: succinate + FAD → fumarate + FADH2 → 1.5 ATP. (4) Fumarase: fumarate + H2O → malate (no ATP). (5) Malate DH: malate + NAD+ → OAA + NADH → 2.5 ATP. TOTAL from carriers: 1 NADH (GDH) + 1 NADH (alpha-KGDH) + 1 GTP + 1 FADH2 + 1 NADH (malate DH) = 2.5 + 2.5 + 1.0 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 10.0 ATP. However, the NH4+ generated must be detoxified through the urea cycle, which costs 4 ATP equivalents (3 ATP + 1 ATP equivalent from fumarate → aspartate). The net cost of urea synthesis distributed per nitrogen is approximately 2 ATP per NH4+. So net ATP approximately 10.0 - 2.0 = approximately 8 ATP (or approximately 10.5 if considering that glutamate provides only one of the two nitrogens in urea). The key insight is that amino acids CAN serve as energy sources (C is wrong), but their ATP yield varies widely depending on their entry point into the TCA cycle and the carbon chain length. Glucose yields approximately 30-32 ATP, far more than a single glutamate (A and D are wrong).",

(2) Dephosphorylated PFK-2/FBPase-2 has active KINASE domain → produces F-2,6-BP (increased to 3.0x). (3) Elevated F-2,6-BP: Activates PFK-1 (2.5x) → glycolysis UP. Inhibits FBPase-1 (0.3x) → gluconeogenesis DOWN. (4) Net: Glucose output decreases to 0.3x (liver takes up glucose, stores as glycogen, and oxidizes via glycolysis). GLUCAGON (fasting state): (1) Activates cAMP-PKA pathway, which phosphorylates PFK-2/FBPase-2. (2) Phosphorylated PFK-2/FBPase-2 has active PHOSPHATASE domain → degrades F-2,6-BP (decreased to 0.1x).

The oxygen atoms from O2 end up in water, NOT in CO2. This was demonstrated by using 18O2 — the 18O appeared in H2O, not CO2. (2) CO2 OXYGEN ATOMS: In the TCA cycle, water participates in several reactions: citrate synthase (H2O cleaves citryl-CoA), aconitase (dehydration/rehydration), and fumarase (hydration of fumarate). These reactions incorporate oxygen atoms from water into TCA cycle intermediates (particularly into the carboxylate groups of citrate, isocitrate, and malate). When isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase catalyze oxidative decarboxylation, the CO2 released carries oxygen atoms that were originally incorporated from water. (3) ATP PHOSPHATE: ATP synthesis involves inorganic phosphate (Pi), which exchanges oxygen atoms with water. 18O from H2-18O equilibrates with Pi and is incorporated into ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. This experiment definitively established the separate metabolic fates of O2 (→ H2O) and H2O-derived oxygen (→ CO2) in cellular respiration. Option A confuses the O2 pathway. The 18O incorporation is not an artifact (C). CO2 does contain oxygen atoms (D).",

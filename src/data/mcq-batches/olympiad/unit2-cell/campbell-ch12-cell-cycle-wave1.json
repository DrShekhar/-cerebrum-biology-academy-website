      "question": "Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF) was originally identified in Xenopus oocytes. Which of the following correctly describes the molecular composition of MPF and its primary biochemical activity during M-phase entry?",
      "options": [
        "Cyclin A–CDK2 complex; activates the APC/C-Cdh1 complex to degrade securin and initiate sister chromatid separation",
        "Cyclin D–CDK4 complex; hyperphosphorylates Rb to release E2F transcription factors and promote S-phase gene expression",
        "Cyclin E–CDK2 complex; phosphorylates ORC components at replication origins to initiate DNA synthesis",
        "Cyclin B–CDK1 complex; phosphorylates nuclear lamins, condensins, and Golgi matrix proteins to drive nuclear envelope breakdown, chromosome condensation, and organelle fragmentation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "MPF was biochemically purified as a heterodimer of cyclin B and CDK1 (also called Cdc2 in fission yeast). Upon activation, CDK1 phosphorylates a wide array of substrates required for mitotic entry: nuclear lamins (causing nuclear envelope breakdown), condensin subunits (promoting chromosome condensation), and Golgi matrix proteins such as GM130 (leading to Golgi fragmentation). Option A is incorrect because APC/C-Cdh1 is activated during mitotic exit and G1, not entry, and cyclin A-CDK2 functions primarily in S-phase and early mitosis. Option B describes G1-phase events. Option C describes the firing of replication origins in S-phase.",

      "question": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature anaphase onset. Which of the following best describes the molecular mechanism by which unattached kinetochores inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)?",
      "options": [
        "Unattached kinetochores recruit Aurora B kinase, which directly phosphorylates APC/C subunits and inactivates the complex",
        "Unattached kinetochores recruit PP2A phosphatase, which dephosphorylates APC/C co-activators, rendering them unable to bind substrates",
        "Unattached kinetochores activate the DNA damage checkpoint through ATR, which phosphorylates Cdc20 and targets it for proteasomal degradation",
        "Unattached kinetochores serve as catalytic platforms for assembling the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), comprising Mad2, BubR1, Bub3, and Cdc20, which sequesters Cdc20 away from APC/C"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The SAC operates by generating the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) at unattached kinetochores. Mad1 at unattached kinetochores acts as a template to convert open-Mad2 (O-Mad2) to closed-Mad2 (C-Mad2), which then binds Cdc20. This Mad2-Cdc20 complex associates with BubR1 and Bub3 to form the MCC, which is a potent inhibitor of APC/C-Cdc20. By sequestering Cdc20, the MCC prevents APC/C from ubiquitinating securin and cyclin B, thereby blocking anaphase onset. Option A is wrong because Aurora B corrects erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments but does not directly inactivate APC/C. Option B is incorrect because PP2A functions in error correction at kinetochores, not in APC/C inactivation. Option C conflates the DNA damage response with the SAC.",

      "question": "A cell homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in the RB1 gene shows constitutive expression of E2F target genes. Which of the following best explains why loss of Rb alone is insufficient to cause cancer, consistent with the multi-hit model of tumorigenesis?",
      "options": [
        "Rb loss eliminates the G1/S checkpoint but cells still require mitogenic signaling through Ras-MAPK to produce cyclin D, which is needed for CDK4/6 activation and full cell cycle commitment",
        "Rb loss only affects the G2/M checkpoint, so cells can still arrest at G1/S through p53-dependent mechanisms",
        "Without Rb, E2F cannot bind DNA because it requires Rb as a transcriptional co-activator",
        "Rb loss is compensated by complete redundancy with p107 and p130 in all tissue types, making single RB1 mutations entirely neutral"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cancer is a multi-step process requiring the accumulation of mutations in multiple pathways. While Rb loss deregulates the G1/S transition by freeing E2F transcription factors, a cell still needs additional oncogenic hits for full transformation. For instance, cells still need growth factor signaling (e.g., through Ras-MAPK) to drive cyclin D expression, and they retain other tumor-suppressive mechanisms such as p53-mediated apoptosis and senescence. Option B is incorrect because Rb primarily functions at the G1/S boundary, not G2/M. Option C is wrong because E2F is a transcription factor that binds DNA independently; Rb acts as a repressor of E2F, not an activator. Option D overstates the redundancy; while p107 and p130 (pocket protein family) can partially compensate, they do not fully substitute for Rb in all tissues, as evidenced by the high penetrance of retinoblastoma with biallelic RB1 loss.",

      "options": [
        "Wee1 activates CDK1 by adding a stimulatory phosphate on Thr161, while Cdc25 removes this phosphate to inactivate CDK1 during G2",

        "Wee1 and Cdc25 are functionally redundant phosphatases that both dephosphorylate CDK1 at different residues during prophase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Wee1 kinase phosphorylates CDK1 on Thr14 and Tyr15 (Myt1 also contributes to Thr14 phosphorylation), maintaining CDK1 in an inactive state during G2 while cyclin B accumulates. The phosphatase Cdc25 (specifically Cdc25C in vertebrates) removes these inhibitory phosphates to activate CDK1. Critically, active CDK1 phosphorylates and further activates Cdc25 (positive feedback) while simultaneously phosphorylating and inhibiting Wee1 (double-negative feedback). These interlocking feedback loops create a bistable switch that ensures an abrupt, irreversible transition into mitosis. Option A is incorrect because the activating phosphorylation on Thr161 is performed by CAK (CDK-Activating Kinase), not Wee1. Option B wrongly attributes ubiquitin ligase activity to Wee1. Option D is wrong because Wee1 is a kinase, not a phosphatase.",

      "options": [
        "In hereditary retinoblastoma, both RB1 alleles are inactivated by somatic mutations in a single retinal cell; in sporadic cases, one allele is silenced by epigenetic mechanisms",
        "Hereditary retinoblastoma requires only one somatic mutation because one RB1 allele is already mutated in the germline; sporadic retinoblastoma requires two independent somatic mutations in the same cell",
        "Hereditary retinoblastoma involves gain-of-function mutations in RB1 that produce a dominant-negative protein; sporadic cases involve complete gene deletion",
        "Both forms require exactly two hits, but hereditary cases always involve loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p while sporadic cases involve chromosome 13q"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Knudson's two-hit hypothesis states that both alleles of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for retinoblastoma to develop. In hereditary (familial) retinoblastoma, the child inherits one mutant RB1 allele through the germline, so every cell already carries one hit. Only a single additional somatic mutation (second hit) in any retinal cell is needed, explaining the early onset, bilateral presentation, and high penetrance. In sporadic retinoblastoma, both RB1 alleles must be independently inactivated by somatic mutations in the same retinoblast, which is statistically rare, explaining the later onset and unilateral presentation. Option A is incorrect because in hereditary cases the first hit is germline, not somatic. Option C is wrong because RB1 mutations are loss-of-function, not gain-of-function. Option D incorrectly places RB1 on chromosome 17p; RB1 is located on chromosome 13q14.",

        "TERC catalyzes the ligation of pre-formed TTAGGG oligonucleotides onto chromosome ends while TERT serves as a structural scaffold"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Human telomerase consists of two essential components: TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), the catalytic protein subunit with reverse transcriptase activity, and TERC (telomerase RNA component, also called hTR), which contains an 11-nucleotide template sequence (3'-CAAUCCCAAUC-5') complementary to the telomeric repeat. TERT uses this RNA template to add TTAGGG repeats to the 3' overhang of the G-rich strand at chromosome ends. After extension, DNA polymerase alpha-primase synthesizes the complementary C-rich strand. This solves the end-replication problem. Option A is wrong because telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), not DNA-dependent. Option C describes TERRA transcription, which is performed by RNA polymerase II, not telomerase. Option D is entirely fictional.",

        "APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitinates cohesin directly, targeting it for proteasomal degradation at the metaphase plate",

        "SAC inactivation allows APC/C-Cdc20 to ubiquitinate securin, leading to its proteasomal degradation; this releases the protease separase, which cleaves the Scc1/Rad21 subunit of cohesin",
        "CDK1 directly phosphorylates and cleaves cohesin subunits once all kinetochores achieve bipolar attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "When all kinetochores achieve proper bipolar (amphitelic) attachment, the SAC is silenced and Cdc20 is freed to activate APC/C. APC/C-Cdc20 polyubiquitinates securin, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Securin is an inhibitor of the cysteine protease separase; its destruction liberates separase, which then cleaves the Scc1/Rad21 kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex at the centromere. This allows sister chromatids to separate and move toward opposite poles. Notably, in vertebrates, most arm cohesin is removed during prophase by the Wapl pathway (the prophase pathway), dependent on Plk1 and Aurora B phosphorylation of cohesin's SA2 subunit. Only centromeric cohesin, protected by shugoshin-PP2A, persists until anaphase. Option A is wrong because APC/C targets securin, not cohesin directly. Option B is wrong because Plk1 is a kinase, not a protease. Option D is wrong because CDK1 is a kinase and does not cleave cohesin.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds p53's transactivation domain, ubiquitinates p53, and targets it for proteasomal degradation, keeping p53 levels low in unstressed cells. Nutlin-3a mimics the p53 peptide and competitively occupies the p53-binding pocket of MDM2, preventing MDM2 from binding and degrading p53. This leads to rapid p53 stabilization and accumulation. Active p53 then transcriptionally induces its target genes, most notably CDKN1A (encoding p21), a CDK inhibitor. p21 binds and inhibits cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes, maintaining Rb in its hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive state and causing G1 arrest. Option A describes the opposite of what occurs. Option B is fabricated; p53 does not repress Ras transcription. Option C is wrong because p53 does not directly interact with Rb in this manner.",

        "Depletion of cytoplasmic cyclin D stores over successive divisions eventually reduces CDK4/6 activity below the threshold needed for S-phase entry"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Hayflick limit (typically 50-70 doublings for human fibroblasts) is primarily caused by progressive telomere shortening due to the end-replication problem. Most somatic cells lack sufficient telomerase activity to fully replicate chromosome ends, so telomeres shorten by approximately 50-200 bp per cell division. When telomeres become critically short, they lose their protective shelterin cap and exposed chromosome ends are recognized as double-strand breaks. This triggers the ATM/ATR-p53-p21 DNA damage response pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the p16INK4a-Rb pathway is activated through epigenetic derepression of the CDKN2A locus during prolonged culture and aging. Together, these pathways enforce irreversible replicative senescence. Option A describes the UPR, which is not the primary mechanism. Option B is fictional. Option D is incorrect because cyclin D is synthesized continuously in response to mitogenic signals and is not depleted through division.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "HER2 (ErbB2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that has no known direct ligand. Under normal conditions, it serves as the preferred dimerization partner for other ErbB family members (EGFR, ErbB3, ErbB4). When HER2 is overexpressed due to gene amplification, the high receptor density at the cell surface promotes spontaneous homodimerization and heterodimerization without ligand binding. This constitutive dimerization leads to trans-autophosphorylation and persistent activation of downstream proliferative and survival pathways, particularly Ras-MAPK (promoting proliferation) and PI3K-Akt-mTOR (promoting survival and growth). Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of HER2. Option B is wrong because HER2 is a membrane receptor, not a transcription factor.

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Recent work has shown that cyclin D-CDK4/6 initiates mono-phosphorylation of Rb on any one of 14 CDK sites during early-to-mid G1. This mono-phosphorylated Rb is still partially active. Cyclin E-CDK2, activated later in G1, completes multi-site hyperphosphorylation of Rb, causing it to release E2F transcription factors and fully committing the cell to S-phase entry. S2: TRUE — Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes act as a 'sink' for p27, titrating it away from cyclin E-CDK2 complexes. As cyclin D levels rise in response to mitogens, more p27 is sequestered, allowing newly formed cyclin E-CDK2 to become active. Active cyclin E-CDK2 then phosphorylates p27, targeting it for SCF-Skp2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, amplifying the signal. S3: TRUE — CAK (a complex of cyclin H and CDK7) phosphorylates the conserved T-loop threonine (Thr160 in CDK2, Thr161 in CDK1). This phosphorylation is largely constitutive, meaning it occurs regardless of cell cycle phase and is not the rate-limiting step; cyclin binding and removal of inhibitory phosphates are the primary regulatory steps. S4: FALSE — Cyclin A-CDK2 activity peaks in S-phase and G2, not G1. Origin licensing (loading of MCM2-7 helicase) occurs in late mitosis and G1, mediated by ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1, and is actually inhibited by CDK activity (including cyclin A-CDK2) to prevent re-replication.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — MDM2 (Hdm2 in humans) is the principal negative regulator of p53. It binds the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53, blocking its transcriptional activity, and also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (via its RING domain) that polyubiquitinates p53, targeting it for 26S proteasomal degradation. S2: TRUE — DNA double-strand breaks activate the ATM kinase, which phosphorylates p53 at Ser15 (and also phosphorylates MDM2). This phosphorylation weakens the MDM2-p53 interaction, preventing MDM2-mediated degradation and allowing p53 to accumulate. ATM also activates Chk2, which phosphorylates p53 at Ser20 for additional stabilization. S3: TRUE — When the damage is too severe for repair, p53 shifts from activating cell cycle arrest genes to inducing pro-apoptotic targets. PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) and NOXA are BH3-only proteins that neutralize anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1), allowing Bax/Bak oligomerization, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, and apoptosome formation. S4: FALSE — The first part is correct: MDM2 is indeed a direct transcriptional target of p53, creating a negative feedback loop. However, the loop does NOT ensure that p53 levels remain permanently elevated. Rather, the p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop ensures that p53 activation is transient and self-limiting. Once the stress signal is resolved, newly synthesized MDM2 degrades p53, restoring basal low levels.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — APC/C-Cdc20 is activated once the SAC is satisfied (all kinetochores properly attached). It ubiquitinates securin (releasing separase for cohesin cleavage) and cyclin B (inactivating CDK1), driving the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and mitotic exit. S2: TRUE — During early mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates Cdh1, preventing it from associating with APC/C. As APC/C-Cdc20 destroys cyclin B and CDK1 activity falls, phosphatases (such as Cdc14 in yeast) dephosphorylate Cdh1, allowing it to bind APC/C. APC/C-Cdh1 then maintains low CDK activity throughout G1. S3: TRUE — The D-box (consensus RXXL, where R is arginine, X is any amino acid, and L is leucine) and KEN box (consensus KEN) are the two major degron motifs recognized by APC/C through its co-activators. Cdc20 preferentially recognizes D-box motifs, while Cdh1 recognizes both D-box and KEN box motifs. S4: FALSE — APC/C-Cdh1 is actually inactivated at the G1/S transition by rising cyclin E-CDK2 activity (which phosphorylates Cdh1) and by the inhibitor Emi1. Geminin degradation by APC/C-Cdh1 occurs during G1, not S-phase. In fact, geminin accumulates during S, G2, and M phases to inhibit Cdt1 and prevent re-replication. The timing is crucial: origin licensing occurs in G1 (when APC/C-Cdh1 is active and geminin is absent), and origin firing occurs in S-phase (when geminin has accumulated to prevent re-licensing).",

      "correctAnswer": "FTTF",
      "explanation": "S1: FALSE — Condensin II is loaded onto chromosomes in the nucleus during interphase/prophase (before nuclear envelope breakdown) and contributes to axial shortening. Condensin I, however, gains access to chromosomes only after nuclear envelope breakdown (prometaphase) and contributes to lateral compaction. They are not both loaded during prophase. S2: TRUE — Aurora B kinase is part of the CPC (along with INCENP, survivin, and borealin) and is localized to the inner centromere. When attachments are erroneous (e.g., syntelic, where both sister kinetochores attach to the same pole), the kinetochore substrates are close to Aurora B and become phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of the Ndc80 complex reduces its affinity for microtubules, destabilizing the incorrect attachment and allowing correction. Proper amphitelic attachments generate tension that physically separates kinetochores from the inner centromere, moving substrates out of reach of Aurora B. S3: TRUE — During the prophase pathway, Plk1 and Aurora B phosphorylate the SA2 subunit of cohesin on chromosome arms, facilitating Wapl-mediated removal. At centromeres, Shugoshin (Sgo1) recruits PP2A phosphatase, which counteracts this phosphorylation, keeping centromeric cohesin intact until anaphase. S4: FALSE — Mad1 is stably bound to unattached kinetochores, where it acts as a constitutive platform. It does not cycle between the kinetochore and the cytoplasm. It is Mad2 that undergoes a conformational change: kinetochore-bound Mad1-C-Mad2 acts as a template to convert soluble O-Mad2 (open conformation) to C-Mad2 (closed conformation) in the cytoplasm. Once kinetochores are properly attached, Mad1 is removed by dynein-mediated stripping.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Ras (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras) are small GTPases that cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states. The G12V mutation (and other common oncogenic mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61) prevent GTP hydrolysis by disrupting the interaction with GAPs (GTPase-Activating Proteins), locking Ras in the active state and constitutively activating the MAPK and PI3K pathways. S2: TRUE — This is an important tumor-suppressive safety mechanism. Myc activates the ARF-MDM2-p53 apoptotic pathway: Myc induces p14ARF (p19ARF in mice), which inhibits MDM2 and stabilizes p53. Without concurrent survival signals (e.g., Bcl-2 or PI3K-Akt), elevated Myc triggers apoptosis. This explains why cancer requires multiple hits; Myc overexpression alone is self-limiting. S3: FALSE — BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressors, not proto-oncogenes. They function in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. BRCA1 participates in the DNA damage response and facilitates HR, while BRCA2 directly loads RAD51 onto ssDNA at resected break sites. Loss-of-function mutations (not gain-of-function) predispose to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer by impairing DNA repair and allowing genomic instability. S4: TRUE — APC is a classic tumor suppressor that scaffolds the destruction complex (APC, Axin, GSK-3beta, CK1alpha) responsible for phosphorylating beta-catenin and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. When both APC alleles are lost (consistent with the two-hit hypothesis), beta-catenin accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, and constitutively activates TCF/LEF target genes (including cyclin D1 and Myc). APC mutations are found in over 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers and are the initiating event in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The restriction point (R-point), identified by Arthur Pardee, is the point in late G1 after which cells become independent of mitogenic signaling and are committed to entering S-phase. Molecularly, it corresponds to the point where cyclin E-CDK2 completes Rb hyperphosphorylation, irreversibly releasing E2F transcription factors. Once E2F activates its target genes (including cyclin E itself), a positive feedback loop sustains the decision to enter S-phase. S2: TRUE — ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is activated by the MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) at double-strand breaks. ATR (ATM and Rad3-Related) is activated by ATRIP, which recognizes RPA-coated single-stranded DNA generated at stalled replication forks or by resection of DSBs. They have distinct but overlapping substrate specificities. S3: TRUE — When DNA damage or incomplete replication is detected in G2, ATR activates Chk1, which phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25B/C phosphatases (promoting their cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins) and phosphorylates and stabilizes Wee1 kinase. The net result is maintained inhibitory phosphorylation on Tyr15 of CDK1, keeping it inactive and preventing mitotic entry. S4: FALSE — The specificity is reversed. p16INK4a (encoded by CDKN2A) is an INK4 family inhibitor that specifically binds and inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 (not CDK2), preventing their association with D-type cyclins. In contrast, p21Cip1 (encoded by CDKN1A) is a Cip/Kip family inhibitor with broad specificity, capable of inhibiting cyclin D-CDK4/6, cyclin E-CDK2, and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Mammalian telomeres consist of 5-15 kb of TTAGGG repeats ending in a 100-200 nt 3' single-stranded G-rich overhang. The overhang invades the upstream double-stranded telomeric DNA to form a T-loop (telomere loop), with the displaced strand creating a D-loop (displacement loop). This structure, stabilized by the six-subunit shelterin complex (TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, TPP1, POT1), conceals the chromosome end and prevents it from being recognized as a DNA break. S2: TRUE — TRF2 is critical for T-loop formation and directly represses ATM-mediated DNA damage signaling at telomeres. Removal of TRF2 leads to telomere deprotection, ATM activation, p53 stabilization, and either senescence or end-to-end chromosome fusions mediated by NHEJ. TRF1 regulates telomere length and prevents replication fork stalling at telomeres. S3: TRUE — The vast majority (~85-90%) of human cancers upregulate telomerase, often through activating TERT promoter mutations (e.g., C228T, C250T), TERT gene amplification, or epigenetic reactivation. The remaining ~10-15% use the ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) pathway, which relies on homologous recombination between telomeric sequences and is characterized by heterogeneous telomere lengths and ALT-associated PML bodies. S4: FALSE — Ectopic TERT expression can bypass replicative senescence and immortalize human fibroblasts, but immortalization alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. Classic experiments (Hahn et al., 1999) showed that transformation of normal human cells requires at least TERT (for immortalization), oncogenic Ras (for proliferative signals), and inactivation of both p53 and Rb pathways (e.g., by SV40 large T antigen). TERT-immortalized fibroblasts with no other genetic changes remain non-tumorigenic, maintain normal growth control, and do not form tumors in nude mice.",

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — During DNA replication, sister chromatids become topologically interlinked (catenated). Topoisomerase II alpha (Topo IIa) is required to decatenate these interlinks during mitosis. Inhibition of Topo IIa (e.g., with ICRF-193) or its depletion leads to unresolved catenanes, causing chromosome bridges during anaphase and failure of cytokinesis. S2: TRUE — The central spindle forms between segregating chromosome masses during anaphase and consists of antiparallel microtubule bundles. PRC1 (Protein Regulator of Cytokinesis 1) cross-links these antiparallel microtubules, while the centralspindlin complex (MKLP1 + MgcRacGAP) recruits signaling molecules, including the RhoGEF ECT2, which activates RhoA at the cell equator. RhoA-GTP activates formins (for actin polymerization) and ROCK (for myosin II activation) to drive contractile ring assembly. S3: TRUE — Survivin is the smallest IAP family member. While other IAPs directly inhibit caspases, survivin's primary role in mitosis is as a component of the CPC (with Aurora B, INCENP, and borealin). The CPC is essential for correcting erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, maintaining the SAC, and completing cytokinesis. S4: FALSE — The statement is reversed. CDK1-mediated phosphorylation during mitotic entry drives nuclear envelope breakdown (not reassembly). CDK1 phosphorylates lamins, nucleoporins (e.g., Nup98, Nup153), and inner nuclear membrane proteins, causing disassembly. Nuclear envelope reassembly in telophase requires CDK1 inactivation (by APC/C-mediated cyclin B destruction) and subsequent dephosphorylation of these substrates by phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2A.",

Between 9 and 10 hours, cyclin B1 levels plummet from 195 to 50 AU, coinciding with a drop in H3-pSer10 and mitotic index, indicating mitotic exit. This precipitous decline in cyclin B1 is caused by APC/C-Cdc20-mediated polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The destruction of cyclin B1 inactivates CDK1, which is essential for mitotic exit: it allows dephosphorylation of CDK1 substrates by phosphatases (PP1, PP2A), driving chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope reassembly, and cytokinesis.

The combined A+B pocket deletion (Δ379-772) essentially abolishes both functions. The C706F point mutation in the B-pocket (which disrupts the LXCXE-binding cleft used by many Rb-interacting proteins) also severely impairs binding and suppression. In contrast, C-terminal deletion retains 75% E2F1 binding and 65% colony suppression, indicating it contributes but is not essential. The S780A/S795A phospho-site mutant shows enhanced tumor suppression (90%) because it cannot be inactivated by CDK-mediated phosphorylation, confirming that the pocket domain function is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. This experiment demonstrates that the pocket domain, where E2F and LXCXE-containing proteins bind, is the critical functional unit for Rb-mediated growth suppression.",

      "explanation": "The data demonstrates that the SAC is critical for accurate chromosome segregation during normal mitosis, not just in response to drug-induced spindle damage. Control cells transit from NEBD to anaphase in ~32 minutes with only 4% lagging chromosomes. When the SAC is compromised by Mad2 knockdown, this time is halved to ~15 minutes, and the rate of lagging chromosomes increases nearly 10-fold to 38%. This shows that the SAC provides essential time for Aurora B-mediated error correction of improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Adding MPS1 inhibition (MPS1 kinase is required for SAC activation at kinetochores) further accelerates mitosis to 12 minutes and worsens lagging chromosomes to 52%. Strikingly, nocodazole (which depolymerizes microtubules) triggers a robust SAC arrest (185 min), but this arrest is completely overridden by Mad2 knockdown (18 min), leading to catastrophic mis-segregation (65%). Low-dose taxol stabilizes microtubules, causing some improper attachments that activate the SAC and delay anaphase (95 min), but the SAC gives time for error correction, limiting lagging chromosomes to 22%. Option A ignores the dramatic effect of Mad2 loss. Option B is contradicted by the increased errors in Mad2 siRNA cells even without drugs. Option C is incorrect because taxol actually increases errors by stabilizing incorrect attachments.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This data elegantly illustrates two distinct routes to inactivating the same tumor suppressor pathways. In HPV-positive cervical carcinoma: (1) The HPV E6 oncoprotein recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP (UBE3A) to p53, promoting its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This explains the low p53 protein levels (H-score 25) despite a very low mutation rate (5%) — p53 is wild-type but constantly degraded. (2) The HPV E7 oncoprotein binds and targets Rb for proteasomal degradation, explaining the near-complete loss of Rb protein (only 8% detectable). Loss of functional Rb removes the negative feedback on the CDKN2A locus (which is normally repressed by Rb-E2F), causing compensatory overexpression of p16INK4a (95% positive). Clinically, p16 overexpression is used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. In HPV-negative endometrial carcinoma: p53 is inactivated by somatic mutations (65% mutation rate). Most p53 mutations are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain that produce a stable but non-functional protein with a long half-life, explaining the paradoxically high immunohistochemical staining (H-score 220). Rb is retained (75%) because there is no viral E7 to degrade it, and p16 is low (15%) because the Rb-E2F negative feedback loop is intact.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Option A provides a rigorous, multi-layered experimental approach. First, flow cytometry with PI staining separates cells by DNA content: 2N peak (G1) vs 4N peak (G2/M). If Compound X causes G1/S arrest, cells accumulate at 2N; if G2/M arrest, cells accumulate at 4N. However, PI staining alone cannot distinguish G2 from M because both have 4N DNA content. The key innovation is bivariate flow cytometry: co-staining with anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10), a highly specific mitotic marker. Cells in G2 are 4N/pH3-negative, while cells in mitosis are 4N/pH3-positive. This definitively determines whether the arrest is in G2 or M. Western blotting provides biochemical confirmation: cyclin E accumulation indicates G1/S arrest (cyclin E peaks at the G1/S boundary), cyclin B1 accumulation with high phospho-CDK1-Tyr15 indicates G2 arrest (CDK1 is held inactive by Wee1-mediated Tyr15 phosphorylation), and cyclin B1 accumulation with low phospho-Tyr15 and high CDK1 activity indicates M-phase arrest. Option B is insufficient because it cannot quantify cell cycle distribution or distinguish G2 from G1. Option C is incomplete: BrdU labels S-phase cells but cannot distinguish G1 from G2/M without DNA content co-measurement. Option D is indirect, slow, and unnecessarily complex for this question.",

(i) In vitro kinase assay: Adding purified GST-TSG1 to a reaction containing cyclin D1-CDK4 and recombinant Rb directly tests whether TSG1 can inhibit CDK4 kinase activity. If TSG1 functions like p16INK4a, it should reduce CDK4-mediated Rb phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. (ii) Co-immunoprecipitation: This tests whether TSG1 physically interacts with CDK4/6, as all INK4 family members bind specifically to CDK4 and CDK6 (not CDK2). Binding to CDK4/6 but not CDK2 would support the hypothesis. (iii) Western blot analysis of TSG1-null MEFs: If TSG1 inhibits CDK4/6, then TSG1-null cells should show increased Rb phosphorylation at CDK4-specific sites (e.g., Ser780), elevated E2F target gene expression, and potentially compensatory upregulation or unchanged levels of p16INK4a. (iv) Re-expression experiment: Restoring TSG1 in melanoma cell lines with TSG1 deletion tests sufficiency. If TSG1 is a bona fide CDK4/6 inhibitor, its re-expression should reduce Rb phosphorylation, arrest cells in G1 (detectable by flow cytometry), and suppress colony formation. (v) Epistasis analysis: This is the critical test. If TSG1 acts upstream of Rb (by inhibiting CDK4/6-mediated Rb phosphorylation), then TSG1 should NOT suppress growth in Rb-null cells (since there is no target to keep hypophosphorylated). Failure to suppress growth in Rb-null cells, combined with successful suppression in Rb-positive cells, would strongly support the linear pathway model: TSG1 ⊣ CDK4/6 → Rb-P → E2F → S-phase.

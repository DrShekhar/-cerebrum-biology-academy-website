      "options": [
        "ER-resident chaperones such as BiP/GRP78 will be progressively secreted from the cell via the default secretory pathway",
        "COPII vesicle budding from ER exit sites will be completely abolished",
        "Lysosomal hydrolases will accumulate in the ER lumen instead of reaching lysosomes",
        "The Golgi apparatus will fragment and redistribute into the ER"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The KDEL retrieval system functions to recapture ER-resident soluble proteins (such as BiP/GRP78, PDI, and calreticulin) that escape to the cis-Golgi via bulk flow in COPII vesicles. The KDEL receptor in the cis-Golgi binds the C-terminal KDEL sequence at the lower pH of the Golgi and packages these proteins into COPI retrograde vesicles for return to the ER. Without a functional KDEL receptor, these ER-resident proteins will continue along the default secretory pathway and be secreted extracellularly. COPII budding (B) is independent of KDEL retrieval. Lysosomal targeting uses mannose-6-phosphate, not KDEL (C). Golgi fragmentation (D) occurs with brefeldin A treatment, not KDEL receptor loss.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Drp1 is a large GTPase that is recruited from the cytosol to prospective fission sites on the outer mitochondrial membrane (marked by ER-mitochondria contact sites and pre-constriction by actin/ER tubules). Drp1 oligomerizes into helical ring structures that wrap around the mitochondrion. GTP hydrolysis drives a conformational change that constricts the ring, mechanically squeezing and ultimately severing both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Drp1 does not insert into the membrane (A), does not involve COPI proteins which function in Golgi-to-ER trafficking (B), and does not activate phospholipases (D). Adaptor proteins such as Mff and MiD49/51 recruit Drp1 to the outer membrane.",

      "options": [
        "The transit peptide is recognized by SRP, which targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane for co-translational translocation, followed by vesicular transport to the chloroplast",
        "The transit peptide is recognized by cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones; the unfolded precursor is threaded through the Toc complex in the outer membrane and the Tic complex in the inner membrane, after which the transit peptide is cleaved by stromal processing peptidase",
        "The transit peptide directly inserts into the outer membrane lipid bilayer, and the protein passes through a beta-barrel porin channel without requiring energy or chaperones",
        "The transit peptide is recognized by importin-alpha, which docks at the nuclear pore complex to translocate the protein into the nucleus, from which it is redirected to the chloroplast"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chloroplast protein import is a post-translational process. The precursor protein is fully synthesized on free ribosomes in the cytosol and kept unfolded by cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones. The N-terminal transit peptide is recognized by receptors on the Toc (Translocon at the Outer envelope membrane of Chloroplasts) complex. The protein is then threaded through the Toc and Tic (Translocon at the Inner envelope membrane of Chloroplasts) complexes simultaneously, powered by ATP hydrolysis by stromal Hsp70 and Hsp93 chaperones. Once in the stroma, the transit peptide is cleaved by stromal processing peptidase (SPP). SRP-mediated targeting (A) is for ER-bound proteins. Direct lipid insertion (C) is incorrect as import requires energy and translocon machinery. Importin/NPC (D) is the nuclear import pathway.",

      "options": [
        "It converts Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm to load cargo onto importin for nuclear entry",
        "It stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Ran in the cytoplasm, causing dissociation of Ran-GDP from the importin-cargo complex and freeing importin for recycling back to the nucleus",

        "It stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Ran in the cytoplasm, which triggers release of export cargo from exportin-Ran-GTP complexes and regenerates Ran-GDP for re-import into the nucleus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "RanGAP is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Ran. In the nuclear export cycle, exportin (such as CRM1) binds its cargo and Ran-GTP in the nucleus, and the trimeric complex translocates through the NPC. Upon reaching the cytoplasm, RanGAP stimulates Ran to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, causing a conformational change that dissociates the export complex and releases the cargo into the cytoplasm. The resulting Ran-GDP is then reimported into the nucleus by NTF2, where RanGEF (RCC1) recharges it to Ran-GTP. Option B partially describes what happens but incorrectly states that importin-cargo complexes contain Ran in the cytoplasm; import complexes (importin-cargo) do not contain Ran-GTP during inward translocation. The Ran-GTP gradient (high in nucleus, low in cytoplasm) is the key directional cue for both import and export.",

      "options": [
        "Cancer cells exclusively use oxidative phosphorylation even under hypoxic conditions, generating maximal ATP to fuel rapid division",
        "Cancer cells upregulate beta-oxidation of fatty acids as their primary energy source, bypassing the need for glucose entirely",
        "Cancer cells preferentially perform aerobic glycolysis, converting glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen, which provides biosynthetic intermediates for rapid cell growth despite lower ATP yield per glucose",
        "Cancer cells switch to glutamine as their sole carbon source, completely abolishing glycolysis and the citric acid cycle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Warburg effect describes the observation that cancer cells preferentially ferment glucose to lactate even when oxygen is abundant (aerobic glycolysis). While this yields only 2 ATP per glucose compared to ~30-32 from complete oxidation, the high glycolytic flux generates abundant biosynthetic precursors: glucose-6-phosphate feeds the pentose phosphate pathway (producing NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis), 3-phosphoglycerate is diverted to serine biosynthesis, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate provides glycerol for lipid synthesis. The rapid glucose consumption with lactate export also acidifies the tumor microenvironment, which can suppress immune responses and promote invasion. HIF-1-alpha and oncogenes like Myc and Akt drive this metabolic shift by upregulating glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes.",

      "options": [
        "All three beta subunits simultaneously bind ADP + Pi, synthesize ATP, and release ATP in a synchronized burst",
        "The gamma subunit acts as a static scaffold while the alpha subunits rotate around it, each sequentially catalyzing ATP synthesis",
        "Proton flow through Fo directly phosphorylates ADP at the gamma subunit, which then transfers the ATP to beta subunits for release",
        "The gamma subunit rotation drives sequential conformational changes: one beta subunit transitions from the O (open/empty) state to L (loose, binds ADP+Pi), another from L to T (tight, catalyzes ATP synthesis), and the third from T to O (releases ATP)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Boyer's binding change mechanism, confirmed by structural studies (Walker) and single-molecule experiments (Yoshida), describes rotary catalysis in F1-ATPase. The three beta subunits exist in three different conformational states at any moment: O (open, empty, low affinity), L (loose, binds ADP + Pi loosely), and T (tight, catalytically active, converts ADP + Pi to ATP). Proton flow through the Fo channel drives rotation of the central gamma subunit stalk. Each 120-degree rotation step causes all three beta subunits to simultaneously shift to the next state in the cycle: O to L, L to T, T to O. Thus, one ATP is synthesized (at T) and one is released (at O) per 120-degree step, and a full 360-degree rotation produces 3 ATP. The key insight is that the energy from the proton gradient drives substrate binding and product release, not the chemistry of phosphorylation itself.",

      "options": [
        "COPI (ER to cis-Golgi) → clathrin (trans-Golgi to late endosome)",
        "COPII (ER to cis-Golgi) → COPI (intra-Golgi anterograde) → clathrin (trans-Golgi network to late endosome via mannose-6-phosphate receptor)",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The correct anterograde trafficking route involves: (1) COPII-coated vesicles bud from ER exit sites and deliver cargo to the cis-Golgi (ERGIC). (2) According to the cisternal maturation model (now the predominant view), cargo progresses through the Golgi as cisternae mature from cis to trans, while COPI vesicles mediate retrograde recycling of Golgi-resident enzymes. Thus, anterograde intra-Golgi transport does not require vesicle coats for the cargo itself. (3) At the trans-Golgi network (TGN), mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors recognize M6P tags on lysosomal hydrolases and are packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles with the adaptor AP-1, which deliver the enzymes to late endosomes. The acidic pH of late endosomes causes release of the hydrolase from the M6P receptor. Option B incorrectly assigns COPI to anterograde intra-Golgi transport (COPI mediates retrograde transport).",

        "E3 directly binds free ubiquitin and attaches it to the substrate without requiring E1 or E2, using GTP as the energy source",
        "E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction forming a thioester bond, transfers it to E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) then catalyzes transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to a lysine residue on the substrate",
        "E2 activates ubiquitin by adenylation, E1 transfers it to E3, and E3 attaches it to an N-terminal methionine on the substrate",
        "A single ubiquitin is sufficient for proteasomal recognition; the polyubiquitin chain is assembled on the proteasome itself after substrate binding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involves a three-enzyme cascade. E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) adenylates the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin using ATP, then forms a high-energy thioester bond between E1's active-site cysteine and ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then transferred to the active-site cysteine of E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) via a transthiolation reaction. E3 (ubiquitin ligase) provides substrate specificity by binding both the E2~ubiquitin conjugate and the target protein, catalyzing the formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin's C-terminal glycine and a lysine epsilon-amino group on the substrate. Multiple rounds produce a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain (minimum 4 ubiquitins), which is recognized by the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. There are only ~2 E1s, ~40 E2s, and >600 E3s in humans, reflecting the specificity residing in E3 ligases.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Ferroptosis is a distinct form of regulated cell death that depends on iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. It occurs when the lipid repair enzyme GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4) is inhibited or when cellular glutathione (GSH) is depleted (e.g., by system Xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter inhibition). Without GPX4 activity, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phospholipids in membranes undergo iron-dependent Fenton chemistry, generating lethal lipid hydroperoxides. Morphologically, ferroptosis features shrunken mitochondria with increased membrane density and reduced cristae, but importantly lacks the hallmarks of apoptosis (no chromatin condensation, no nuclear fragmentation, no caspase activation) and necroptosis (no MLKL pores). Option C describes necroptosis (RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL pathway). Option D describes pyroptosis (inflammatory caspase-gasdermin D pathway).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Cori cycle is a metabolic cooperation between skeletal muscle and liver. During anaerobic exercise, muscle glycolysis produces pyruvate faster than mitochondrial oxidation can process it. Lactate dehydrogenase reduces pyruvate to lactate, regenerating NAD+ for continued glycolysis. Lactate is exported to the blood and taken up by hepatocytes, where lactate dehydrogenase oxidizes it back to pyruvate (this reaction is reversible and is driven toward pyruvate in the liver by the NAD+/NADH ratio). Pyruvate then enters gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, which is released into the blood and can be taken up by muscle again. The Cori cycle effectively shifts the metabolic burden of gluconeogenesis (which costs 6 ATP equivalents per glucose) from the energy-depleted muscle to the liver, which can use fatty acid oxidation to power gluconeogenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "TFTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — Macroautophagy begins with formation of a phagophore (isolation membrane) that elongates and closes to form a double-membrane autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to form an autolysosome where the contents are degraded by acid hydrolases. S2: FALSE — The two pathways have significant substrate overlap. The proteasome degrades ubiquitinated proteins (both misfolded and regulatory proteins like cyclins, p53, IkappaB), while autophagy degrades organelles (mitophagy, pexophagy, ER-phagy), protein aggregates (aggrephagy), and even invading pathogens (xenophagy). Selective autophagy receptors like p62/SQSTM1 bind both ubiquitin and LC3, bridging the two systems. S3: TRUE — LC3-II (the lipidated form conjugated to PE) decorates autophagosome membranes and is the most commonly used molecular marker for monitoring autophagy by immunoblotting or fluorescence microscopy. S4: FALSE — mTORC1 is a NEGATIVE regulator of autophagy. When nutrients are abundant, active mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits ULK1 (the autophagy-initiating kinase). During starvation, mTORC1 is inactivated, relieving ULK1 inhibition and inducing autophagy.

S2: TRUE — OPA1 is essential for inner membrane fusion. It exists in long (membrane-anchored) and short (soluble) forms generated by proteolytic processing. Loss-of-function mutations cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy (Kjer disease), the most common inherited optic neuropathy. S3: FALSE — Mitochondrial fission sites are not random. ER tubules wrap around mitochondria at constriction sites (ER-associated mitochondrial division, ERMD), pre-constricting the mitochondrion from ~300-500 nm to ~150 nm diameter before Drp1 oligomerizes at these sites. Actin polymerization by INF2 formin also contributes to pre-constriction. S4: TRUE — In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 kinase is imported and rapidly degraded. When membrane potential is lost, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane, phosphorylates ubiquitin and Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), triggering Parkin to ubiquitinate outer membrane proteins (Mfn1/2, VDAC, Tom20).

      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The direction of spontaneous electron flow is from more negative to more positive reduction potential. The relationship deltaG'o = -nF(deltaE'o) quantifies the free energy released, where n is the number of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant (96,485 J/V/mol), and deltaE'o is the difference in reduction potentials. S2: TRUE — Complex I is the largest ETC complex, containing 45 subunits in mammals. It accepts 2 electrons from NADH via FMN (flavin mononucleotide), passes them through 7 iron-sulfur clusters, and transfers them to ubiquinone. The energy released pumps 4 H+ from the matrix to the intermembrane space per NADH oxidized. S3: FALSE — Cytochrome c shuttles electrons from Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), not from Complex II to Complex IV. Complex II transfers electrons to ubiquinone, and ubiquinone carries them to Complex III. S4: TRUE — The O2/H2O couple has the most positive standard reduction potential in the chain (+0.816 V), making oxygen the strongest electron acceptor. This large deltaE'o between NADH/NAD+ (-0.320 V) and O2/H2O (+0.816 V) provides the thermodynamic driving force for the entire chain (deltaE'o = 1.136 V).",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — In the intrinsic pathway, pro-apoptotic stimuli (DNA damage, ER stress, growth factor withdrawal) shift the balance of Bcl-2 family members toward MOMP. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol triggers Apaf-1 oligomerization into the heptameric apoptosome, which recruits and activates initiator caspase-9. Active caspase-9 cleaves and activates executioner caspases-3 and -7, which dismantle the cell. S2: TRUE — Necroptosis is a regulated necrotic death pathway. When caspase-8 is inhibited (e.g., by viral inhibitors like vFLIP), RIPK1 and RIPK3 form the necrosome complex. RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL, causing its oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane, where it forms pores. Cell lysis releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HMGB1, triggering inflammation. S3: FALSE — While caspase-1 (in the canonical inflammasome pathway) was the first identified gasdermin D (GSDMD) protease, caspase-4, -5 (human) and caspase-11 (mouse) in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway also directly cleave GSDMD. The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD oligomerizes and forms pores in the plasma membrane. S4: TRUE — The Bcl-2 family is the master regulator of MOMP. Anti-apoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and prevent Bax/Bak activation. When BH3-only activators (Bid, Bim) are induced, they directly activate Bax and Bak, which undergo conformational changes, oligomerize, and form large pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane.",

      "correctAnswer": "TFTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — In the absence of Wnt, the destruction complex (Axin, APC, GSK3-beta, CK1) phosphorylates beta-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Wnt binding to Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6 recruits Dishevelled, which disrupts the destruction complex. Stabilized beta-catenin accumulates and enters the nucleus, where it displaces Groucho repressor from TCF/LEF transcription factors, activating Wnt target genes (c-Myc, cyclin D1, Axin2). S2: FALSE — Notch signaling does require direct cell-cell contact, but the ligands (Delta/Serrate/Jagged) are transmembrane proteins on the signaling cell, NOT soluble secreted ligands. The ligand on the signaling cell binds the Notch receptor on the receiving cell, and endocytosis of the ligand by the signaling cell generates a mechanical pulling force that exposes the S2 cleavage site on Notch, enabling sequential cleavage by ADAM protease and gamma-secretase to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). S3: TRUE — In vertebrates, Hedgehog signaling depends on the primary cilium. Without Hh, Patched localizes to the cilium and prevents Smoothened from entering. Gli transcription factors (Gli2, Gli3) are phosphorylated by PKA, CK1, and GSK3, then processed by the proteasome into truncated repressor forms (GliR). When Hh binds Patched, Patched exits the cilium, Smoothened enters and accumulates, and full-length Gli activators (GliA) are produced. S4: TRUE — Loss of APC function occurs in >80% of colorectal cancers and is typically the initiating event in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Without functional APC, the destruction complex cannot degrade beta-catenin, leading to constitutive Wnt signaling and uncontrolled proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.",

      "correctAnswer": "TTTF",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT) on the inner chloroplast envelope exchanges triose phosphates (dihydroxyacetone phosphate/G3P) for inorganic phosphate (Pi). Exported triose phosphates are used in the cytosol for sucrose synthesis (the major transport sugar in plants) or can enter glycolysis to generate ATP and pyruvate. S2: TRUE — Photorespiration is a wasteful process where RuBisCO's oxygenase activity produces 2-phosphoglycolate (2C) and 3-PGA (3C) instead of two 3-PGA molecules. The phosphoglycolate must be salvaged through the glycolate pathway, which involves three organelles: chloroplasts (phosphoglycolate phosphatase produces glycolate), peroxisomes (glycolate oxidase produces glyoxylate, then transamination produces glycine), and mitochondria (glycine decarboxylase converts 2 glycine to serine + CO2 + NH3). S3: TRUE — The alternative oxidase (AOX) is unique to plants, fungi, and some protists. It branches from the main ETC at ubiquinol, transferring electrons directly to O2 to form water. Since it bypasses Complexes III and IV, no proton gradient is generated for this portion of electron flow, and the energy is released as heat. This is exploited in thermogenic plants like skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus). S4: FALSE — In the dark, plant cells perform both glycolysis and full mitochondrial respiration (citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation), just like animal cells.

      "correctAnswer": "TTFT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — COPII assembly begins when Sec12 (a GEF on the ER membrane) activates Sar1 by catalyzing GDP-to-GTP exchange. GTP-bound Sar1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix that inserts into the ER membrane, initiating membrane curvature. Sar1-GTP then recruits the inner coat complex Sec23/Sec24 (where Sec24 is the primary cargo adaptor), followed by the outer coat complex Sec13/Sec31, which forms a cage-like structure that deforms the membrane into a vesicle. S2: TRUE — COPI coats mediate retrograde transport. In the Golgi-to-ER direction, COPI vesicles retrieve escaped ER-resident membrane proteins bearing di-lysine (KKXX) motifs on their cytoplasmic tails, as well as KDEL receptor-cargo complexes. COPI also retrieves Golgi-resident enzymes during cisternal maturation. S3: FALSE — COPII cargo selection is highly selective, not nonspecific. Sec24, the cargo-binding subunit of the inner coat, recognizes specific ER export signals on transmembrane cargo proteins (e.g., diacidic DxE motifs, di-hydrophobic motifs). Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is captured by transmembrane cargo receptors (e.g., ERGIC-53 for glycoproteins) that interact with Sec24 on the cytoplasmic side. While some bulk flow occurs, most cargo is actively selected. S4: TRUE — Arf1, a small GTPase, plays an analogous role to Sar1 for COPI assembly. A GEF (GBF1) on the Golgi membrane activates Arf1, which then inserts a myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic helix into the Golgi membrane and recruits the coatomer complex (alpha-COP through zeta-COP, collectively the COPI coat).",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data demonstrate the coupling between electron transport and ATP synthesis. In the control (Condition 1), both O2 consumption and ATP production are high. Oligomycin (Condition 2) blocks the Fo proton channel, preventing proton flow through ATP synthase. This inhibits ATP synthesis directly AND causes the proton gradient to build up to a point where it opposes further proton pumping by the ETC, thereby reducing O2 consumption (respiratory control). DCCD (Condition 4) similarly blocks the Fo channel by covalently modifying Asp-61 in the c-ring subunits, producing essentially the same effect. When FCCP (a protonophore uncoupler) is added with either inhibitor (Conditions 3 and 5), it provides an alternative path for protons across the inner membrane, dissipating the gradient. This relieves the backpressure on the ETC, restoring O2 consumption. However, since protons now flow through FCCP instead of through ATP synthase, ATP synthesis remains negligible. Option A is incorrect because both oligomycin and DCCD target the Fo subunit (proton channel), not the F1 catalytic site. The residual ATP (Option D) likely represents substrate-level phosphorylation (from succinyl-CoA synthetase in the citric acid cycle), not a secondary proton channel.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data beautifully illustrate the principle that protein sorting depends on specific sorting signals at multiple points along the secretory pathway. Construct A (KDEL-tagged) is retained in the ER because the KDEL receptor in the cis-Golgi captures escaped ER-resident proteins and returns them via COPI retrograde vesicles. The 3% secretion demonstrates that this retrieval system, while efficient, is not perfect — a small fraction of KDEL-bearing proteins escape recapture. Construct B (no retention signal) follows the default secretory pathway and is secreted, confirming that secretion is the default fate for proteins entering the ER. Construct C (KKXX motif) is retained in the ER membrane via COPI-mediated retrograde transport that recognizes the cytoplasmic di-lysine motif. Construct D shows mannose-6-phosphate targeting to lysosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN. Construct E shows that NLS-mediated nuclear import is independent of the ER/secretory pathway (no signal peptide means the protein remains cytosolic and is imported through NPCs). Option A is wrong because multiple signals (KDEL, KKXX, M6P, NLS) contribute to sorting. Option C is wrong because Construct E lacks a signal peptide and uses an entirely different pathway.

Condition 4 (GTPgammaS) is particularly informative: non-hydrolyzable GTP locks Ran in the GTP-bound state. Importin-beta can still dock at the NPC and even partially translocate, but without GTP hydrolysis by Ran, the import complex cannot be efficiently disassembled in the nucleus (Ran-GTP normally binds importin-beta to release cargo), and importin cannot be efficiently recycled.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data reveal important principles of mitochondrial dynamics. Wild-type cells shift from predominantly tubular (70%) to hyperfused (70%) mitochondria upon starvation. This stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SiMH) is a well-documented protective response: elongated mitochondria are too large to be engulfed by autophagosomes, protecting them from mitophagy during nutrient stress. Additionally, hyperfused mitochondria have greater cristae surface area and maintain more efficient ATP production. Drp1-KO cells are constitutively hyperfused (68%) because fission is abolished while fusion continues unopposed — this mimics the starvation response. They show a slight further increase in hyperfusion during starvation (84%) due to enhanced fusion activity. Mfn1/2-DKO cells are overwhelmingly fragmented (88%) because outer membrane fusion is abolished while Drp1-mediated fission continues; starvation barely changes this because fusion machinery is absent. OPA1-KO shows similar fragmentation (91%) because inner membrane fusion failure also prevents net fusion. Option C is backwards — Drp1 mediates fission, not fusion. Option D is incorrect because Mfn1/2 act on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane; they form separate complexes.",

You have access to cultured mammalian cells, proteasome inhibitor MG132, lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (V-ATPase inhibitor that raises lysosomal pH), cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor), and antibodies against Protein X, ubiquitin, and LC3. Which experimental approach would most definitively distinguish between the two degradation pathways?",
      "experimentContext": "Protein X is a short-lived protein (half-life ~2 hours) that is rapidly degraded under normal growth conditions. Preliminary data show that Protein X levels increase when cells are treated with the general protease inhibitor leupeptin, but the specific degradation pathway is unknown. The protein localizes to both cytoplasm and mitochondrial outer membrane by immunofluorescence.",
      "options": [
        "Treat cells with cycloheximide alone and measure Protein X levels at 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours by Western blot. If levels decrease, the protein is degraded by the proteasome; if levels remain stable, it is degraded by autophagy",
        "Perform a cycloheximide chase experiment with and without MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) or bafilomycin A1 (lysosomal inhibitor): if MG132 stabilizes Protein X (prevents degradation) while bafilomycin A1 does not, the proteasome pathway is responsible (and vice versa).

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B provides the most rigorous experimental design with proper controls and confirmatory assays. The cycloheximide chase blocks new protein synthesis, allowing measurement of the degradation rate of existing Protein X. Comparing degradation rates in the presence of pathway-specific inhibitors distinguishes the responsible pathway: MG132 specifically inhibits the 26S proteasome, while bafilomycin A1 blocks lysosomal acidification (preventing acid hydrolase activity and autophagic flux). If Protein X accumulates with MG132 but not bafilomycin A1, the proteasome is responsible. Confirmatory experiments (IP + ubiquitin blot for proteasomal substrates; LC3 co-localization for autophagic substrates) provide mechanistic validation. Given that Protein X localizes partly to the mitochondrial outer membrane, it could be a substrate for PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy — the bafilomycin A1 and LC3 experiments would detect this. Option A only measures whether the protein is degraded at all, not which pathway is responsible. Option C is flawed because ubiquitin overexpression does not specifically enhance degradation and ubiquitin also has non-degradative roles (K63-linked chains, monoubiquitination). Option D is technically infeasible — LAMP1 knockout does not eliminate lysosomes, as LAMP1 is not essential for lysosome biogenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B is the most comprehensive and well-controlled experimental strategy. It tests the hypothesis in a stepwise manner: (1) FCCP treatment on the Seahorse analyzer measures maximum respiratory capacity (spare respiratory capacity) by dissipating the proton gradient, forcing the ETC to run at maximum rate. If OCR increases substantially with FCCP, mitochondria are structurally and functionally intact, arguing against intrinsic mitochondrial dysfunction as the cause of the Warburg effect. (2) HIF-1-alpha knockdown (or VHL overexpression to promote HIF-1-alpha degradation) directly tests whether HIF-1-alpha drives the glycolytic phenotype. If reducing HIF-1-alpha levels causes a metabolic shift from glycolysis (decreased ECAR) to oxidative phosphorylation (increased OCR), this supports the pseudohypoxia hypothesis. (3) For any cell lines that do NOT show FCCP-responsive OCR increase, TEM examination of mitochondrial cristae structure provides an independent assessment of mitochondrial integrity. This design distinguishes between the two hypotheses for each cell line individually. Option A only confirms the phenotype without addressing the mechanism. Option C is too indirect — HIF-1-alpha overexpression alone does not cause cancer (it may induce metabolic changes but tumorigenesis requires multiple hits). Option D is extreme and eliminates both normal and abnormal mitochondrial function, making it impossible to assess the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction versus HIF-1-alpha.",

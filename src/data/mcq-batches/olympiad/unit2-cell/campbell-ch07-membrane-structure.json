      "explanation": "The Frye-Edidin experiment (1970) provided compelling visual evidence for protein lateral mobility. They fused mouse and human cells using Sendai virus, then used species-specific fluorescent antibodies (green for mouse, red for human) to track membrane proteins. Within 40 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius, the two sets of proteins had intermixed completely over the hybrid cell surface, demonstrating that membrane proteins diffuse laterally. Cooling to 15 degrees Celsius slowed this mixing, confirming it was an energy-dependent (thermally driven) process. Freeze-fracture EM (A) showed proteins exist within the bilayer but not their mobility. Bacteriorhodopsin crystallography (C) revealed structure, not dynamics. Membrane thickness measurement (D) indicated bilayer dimensions but not protein behavior.",

      "options": [
        "It would undergo spontaneous phase separation into pure cholesterol domains and pure phospholipid domains",
        "It would be completely rigid and unable to support lateral diffusion of proteins",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Cholesterol is a fluidity buffer with dual effects. At physiological temperatures where phospholipids are in a liquid-disordered state, cholesterol's rigid sterol ring restricts the motion of nearby hydrocarbon chains, reducing fluidity. At temperatures below the phase transition, cholesterol prevents tight packing by inserting between phospholipid tails, increasing fluidity and preventing solidification. A membrane with 40% cholesterol at 37 degrees Celsius would therefore be in a liquid-ordered state \u2014 less fluid than a pure phospholipid membrane above its transition temperature (eliminating A) but more fluid than a gel-phase membrane (eliminating C). Cholesterol does promote formation of lipid rafts enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, but these are dynamic domains, not complete phase separation (eliminating D). This buffering effect is why cholesterol is essential for membrane function across temperature ranges.",

      "explanation": "The Na+/K+-ATPase (sodium-potassium pump) is the classic example of primary active transport. It directly hydrolyzes ATP to pump 3 Na+ ions out and 2 K+ ions into the cell, both against their concentration gradients. Each transport cycle uses one ATP molecule and involves phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the pump, causing conformational changes between E1 and E2 states. Facilitated diffusion (A) moves solutes DOWN their concentration gradient through proteins \u2014 no energy input. Osmosis (B) is passive water movement through aquaporins or the lipid bilayer. Secondary active transport by SGLT1 (D) moves glucose against its gradient but is powered by the Na+ gradient (itself established by the Na+/K+-ATPase), not by direct ATP hydrolysis.

The channel is oriented so that water molecules pass single-file, with their dipoles reoriented at the NPA constriction to break the hydrogen-bonded water chain, preventing proton hopping (Grotthuss mechanism). S2 is TRUE: The two NPA motifs from opposite loops meet in the center of the channel, creating a constriction that reorients water molecules and provides size exclusion. An additional selectivity filter (ar/R constriction) near the extracellular end uses an arginine residue to provide additional selectivity. S3 is TRUE: Vasopressin (ADH) binds V2 receptors on basolateral membranes of collecting duct principal cells, activating cAMP-PKA signaling that triggers exocytic insertion of AQP2-containing vesicles into the apical membrane, increasing water reabsorption.

(2) Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations formed by the raft-associated protein caveolin that mediate a distinct endocytic pathway (B is correct).

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data show classic saturation kinetics: uptake rate increases with glucose concentration but plateaus at a maximum rate (Vmax ~69-70 nmol/min). This hyperbolic relationship is diagnostic of carrier-mediated transport, where a finite number of transporter proteins (GLUT1 in erythrocytes) become saturated at high substrate concentrations. From the data, Vmax is approximately 70 nmol/min. The Km (concentration at half-maximal velocity, ~35 nmol/min) can be estimated at approximately 1.5 mM. Simple diffusion (A) would show a linear, non-saturating relationship because it depends only on the concentration gradient and membrane permeability. Active transport (C) is unlikely because glucose enters erythrocytes down its concentration gradient (blood glucose ~5 mM, intracellular glucose is rapidly consumed). Endocytosis (D) would not show these kinetics and is too slow for metabolic glucose supply.",

For a cell with a resting membrane potential of -70 mV, which statement about chloride ion (Cl-) movement is correct? (Assume intracellular [Cl-] = 4 mM, extracellular [Cl-] = 120 mM)",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "For Cl- with intracellular 4 mM and extracellular 120 mM, the chemical (concentration) gradient strongly favors inward movement. The electrical gradient (membrane potential of -70 mV, negative inside) opposes Cl- influx because negative charges repel the negatively charged chloride ion. To determine the net effect, we calculate the Nernst equilibrium potential for Cl-: E_Cl = (RT/zF) x ln([Cl-]out/[Cl-]in) = (-61.5 mV/1) x log(120/4) = -61.5 x 1.48 = approximately -91 mV. Since the resting membrane potential (-70 mV) is more positive than E_Cl (-91 mV), there is a net electrochemical driving force for Cl- influx (the membrane potential is not sufficiently negative to counterbalance the concentration gradient). The cell is not at equilibrium for Cl- (D is wrong). Both gradients do not favor influx (A is wrong), as the electrical component opposes it, but the net effect is still inward (confirming C).",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a plant cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water enters by osmosis, causing the protoplast to swell and push against the rigid cell wall. The cell wall resists expansion, generating an outward turgor pressure (wall pressure) that counterbalances the osmotic gradient. At full turgor, the water potential inside equals that outside, and net water movement stops. The cell becomes turgid but does not lyse. This is critical for plant physiology \u2014 turgor pressure drives cell expansion during growth, provides mechanical support for non-woody tissues, and powers stomatal opening. Animal cells lack a cell wall and have only the flexible plasma membrane, which cannot withstand significant turgor pressure and ruptures (lysis). The vacuole (A) swells but does not prevent lysis. The plasma membrane (B) is not more rigid in plants. Plasmodesmata (D) do not serve as pressure relief valves.",

If the drug crosses liposomes at the same rate as cells, passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer is sufficient and no transporter is needed. If uptake in cells is significantly faster than in liposomes, a protein-mediated mechanism is implicated. Additional evidence from saturation kinetics (indicative of a finite number of transporter sites), competitive inhibition by structural analogs, and sensitivity to protein-modifying reagents (like DIDS, NEM, or protease treatment) would confirm transporter involvement. Measuring at one temperature only (A) provides no mechanistic information. Fluorescence microscopy (C) shows localization but not transport mechanism. Molecular weight (D) is suggestive but not definitive \u2014 many small molecules still use transporters, and some large molecules can partition into membranes.",

      "explanation": "CFTR is unique among ABC transporters because it functions as an ion channel rather than an active transporter. Most ABC transporters use ATP hydrolysis to pump substrates across membranes (e.g., MDR1/P-glycoprotein pumps drugs out of cells). CFTR retains the structural hallmarks of ABC transporters: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) each with six transmembrane helices, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP. ATP binding causes NBD dimerization, opening the channel pore; ATP hydrolysis drives NBD separation and channel closing. Additionally, CFTR has a unique regulatory (R) domain that must be phosphorylated by PKA for channel activation. CFTR is not voltage-gated (A) since it does not respond to membrane potential changes. It is not a ligand-gated channel (C) in the traditional sense. It has no structural relation to aquaporins (D).",

The Na+ electrochemical gradient is maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral membrane, which pumps 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in using ATP. This creates low intracellular Na+ (~10-12 mM) relative to extracellular (~145 mM), providing a strong driving force for Na+ entry. SGLT1 harnesses this energy to co-transport glucose (2 Na+ per glucose) into the cell, even when intracellular glucose concentration is higher than the gut lumen. The glucose then exits the cell across the basolateral membrane via GLUT2 (facilitated diffusion). SGLT1 itself does not hydrolyze ATP (A), the glucose gradient favors efflux not influx (C), and no G-protein is involved (D).",

Although their calculation contained compensating errors (they underestimated cell surface area but also incompletely extracted lipids), the conclusion was correct. The Frye-Edidin experiment (B) showed protein mobility, not bilayer structure. Freeze-fracture EM (C) showed the bilayer could be split into two leaflets, supporting but not originally demonstrating the bilayer model.

      "explanation": "Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by ouabain prevents the pump from maintaining the normal Na+ and K+ gradients. Without pumping, Na+ gradually accumulates intracellularly (rising from ~12 mM toward 145 mM) and K+ leaks out (falling from ~140 mM toward 4 mM). This causes progressive depolarization of the resting membrane potential (which depends primarily on K+ gradient through leak channels). As the ion gradients dissipate: (1) the Na+ gradient driving secondary active transporters (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Na+/glucose symporter) collapses; (2) the reduced K+ gradient decreases the hyperpolarizing drive; (3) depolarization initially may increase excitability but eventually inactivates voltage-gated Na+ channels, preventing action potential generation. Neurons extensively express Na+/K+-ATPase (C is wrong). Hyperpolarization (A) and increased K+ conductance (D) do not occur with pump inhibition.",

The remaining option \u2014 facilitated diffusion through a carrier protein \u2014 fits all observations: carrier proteins show temperature-dependent conformational changes, saturate when all binding sites are occupied (Michaelis-Menten kinetics), and can be competitively inhibited by structural analogs. Since it moves solutes down their concentration gradient, no ATP is required.",

When phospholipase C (PLC) is activated by G-protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases, it cleaves PIP2 into two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from ER stores, and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates protein kinase C (PKC). PIP2 also serves as a substrate for PI3-kinase, which phosphorylates it to PIP3, a crucial signal for Akt/PKB activation. Sphingomyelin (A) is found predominantly in the outer leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine (B) is mainly in the outer leaflet. Phosphatidylserine (D) is in the inner leaflet but serves primarily as an apoptotic signal when externalized, not as a signaling precursor.",

      "explanation": "This is a subtle but important distinction between isotonic and isosmotic solutions. Although initially isotonic (equal osmolarity), if the solute is membrane-permeable, it will diffuse into the cell down its concentration gradient. As intracellular solute concentration increases, the effective intracellular osmolarity rises (because both the original cell solutes AND the new permeable solute are now inside). This creates an osmotic gradient favoring water influx, causing the cell to swell. In extreme cases, this can lead to lysis. This is why the concept of tonicity (effective osmolarity considering only non-penetrating solutes) differs from osmolarity. A solution may be isosmotic but hypotonic if its solutes are membrane-permeable. Urea, glycerol, and ethanol are clinically relevant examples of membrane-permeable solutes that cause this effect.",

Glycerol and glucose (larger, more polar) cross progressively more slowly. Na+ and Cl- (small but charged) have the lowest permeability by far (10^-11 to 10^-12), demonstrating that the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer presents an enormous energy barrier to ion passage. Size alone (A) cannot explain why O2 (32 Da) crosses 10^13 times faster than Na+ (23 Da). All molecules clearly do NOT cross at similar rates (C). Water does NOT cross faster than O2 (D).

LDL particles bind to LDL receptors (LDLRs) concentrated in clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane. The coated pit invaginates and pinches off (with dynamin assistance) to form a clathrin-coated vesicle. After uncoating, the vesicle delivers its contents to early endosomes, where acidic pH causes LDL to dissociate from the receptor. The receptor is recycled to the plasma membrane (each receptor makes ~150 round trips), while LDL continues to late endosomes/lysosomes where cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed by acid lipase to release free cholesterol. Mutations in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolemia (discovered by Brown and Goldstein, Nobel Prize 1985). Phagocytosis (A) is for large particles. Pinocytosis (B) is non-specific.

At rest, the membrane permeability to K+ is approximately 50-100 times greater than to Na+. The GHK equation weights each ion's contribution by its relative permeability: V_m = (RT/F) x ln[(P_K[K]out + P_Na[Na]out + P_Cl[Cl]in) / (P_K[K]in + P_Na[Na]in + P_Cl[Cl]out)].

S3 is FALSE: Cholesterol has dual, temperature-dependent effects.

Valinomycin dramatically increases K+ permeability, which would hyperpolarize the membrane potential toward the K+ equilibrium potential (E_K ~-90 mV), since the membrane potential is now determined almost entirely by K+. The resting potential is normally -70 mV (slightly more positive than E_K due to small Na+ permeability). Adding valinomycin makes K+ conductance overwhelmingly dominant, pushing V_m closer to E_K.

In red blood cell membranes, the spectrin-based membrane skeleton creates corrals that trap lipids and proteins in domains of ~100 nm, requiring hop diffusion between corrals (the Kusumi 'membrane skeleton fence' model). Muscle cell membranes have even more extensive cytoskeletal attachments through dystrophin-glycoprotein complexes and costameres, creating smaller corrals and slower diffusion.

By bathing each side of the bilayer with solutions of known ionic composition (e.g., 150 mM KCl on one side, 150 mM NaCl on the other) and recording current-voltage relationships, the researcher can determine the reversal potential (voltage at which current = 0). This reversal potential reflects the relative permeability of the channel to the ions present, and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation can be used to calculate permeability ratios (P_K/P_Na, P_K/P_Cl, etc.). Multiple ionic conditions systematically reveal selectivity for monovalent vs. divalent cations, anion vs. cation selectivity, and specific ion preferences. Sequence analysis (A) can suggest but not definitively determine selectivity. Crystal structure (C) provides structural insight but not functional measurements.

The TVGYG signature sequence lines the selectivity filter with backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms arranged to precisely coordinate dehydrated K+ ions at distances mimicking the hydration shell of K+ in water (2.8 Angstroms). When K+ enters the filter, the energy cost of stripping its water hydration shell is exactly compensated by favorable interactions with the carbonyl oxygens. For Na+ (radius 0.95 Angstrom vs. K+ 1.33 Angstrom), the filter is too wide to provide energetically favorable coordination, so the energy cost of dehydrating Na+ is not compensated, making Na+ passage thermodynamically unfavorable. This 'snug fit' mechanism means the channel selects for the LARGER ion, a counterintuitive result. The pore is not too narrow for Na+ (A is wrong; Na+ is actually smaller). There is no ATPase (B).

When an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal and Ca2+ enters through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ binds to synaptotagmin's C2 domains, triggering rapid conformational changes. Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin interacts with both the SNARE complex and the plasma membrane (inserting into the bilayer via Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding), accelerating membrane fusion from a time scale of minutes (spontaneous SNARE-mediated fusion) to sub-milliseconds. This speed is essential for synchronous neurotransmitter release. Calmodulin (A) mediates many Ca2+ responses but not fast exocytosis. Troponin C (C) is the Ca2+ sensor for muscle contraction.

At lower growth temperatures, membrane lipids tend to become more ordered and less fluid. To compensate, E. coli increases the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, whose cis double bonds introduce kinks that prevent tight packing, maintaining fluidity at the lower temperature. At higher temperatures, fewer unsaturated fatty acids are needed because the membrane is inherently more fluid. This adaptation is achieved through temperature-dependent regulation of fatty acid desaturase enzymes and selective incorporation of different fatty acids. The systematic inverse relationship between temperature and unsaturation (62% at 15C down to 20% at 42C) clearly demonstrates active regulation. Thermal denaturation (A) would predict loss of desaturase at high temperatures but would not explain the precise inverse correlation. Bacteria like E. coli do not synthesize cholesterol (D).

      "explanation": "In plants, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (a P-type ATPase) pumps protons out of the cell, creating a proton-motive force (both a pH gradient and a membrane potential, inside negative). This proton gradient drives secondary active transport of sugars into the cell via H+/sucrose symporters (like SUT1/SUC2 family). In phloem loading, sucrose is actively transported from mesophyll cells into companion cells/sieve elements against its concentration gradient, coupled to the downhill movement of H+ back into the cell. Unlike animal cells that primarily use Na+ gradients for secondary active transport, plant cells use H+ gradients because they lack the Na+/K+-ATPase. This is a fundamental difference between plant and animal membrane energetics. Na+-coupled transport (A) does not occur in typical plant cells. K+-coupled sucrose transport (C) does not exist. While the H+-ATPase uses ATP, the sucrose transporter itself is secondary active (D is wrong).",

Removing internal Na+ (8%) shows Na+ is required as a transported substrate from the cytoplasmic side. Removing external K+ (12%) shows K+ is required as a substrate from the extracellular side. Mg2+ depletion (15%) demonstrates that Mg2+ is required as a cofactor (Mg-ATP is the actual substrate, and Mg2+ is needed for the phosphorylation step). Low temperature (3%) indicates the transport cycle requires conformational changes that are temperature-dependent. Vanadate inhibition (7%) is a hallmark of P-type ATPases: vanadate (VO4^3-) is a phosphate analog that binds to the phosphorylation site, trapping the enzyme in the E2 conformation. Together, these results paint a comprehensive picture of a P-type ATPase requiring both transported substrates, a cofactor, physiological temperature, and undergoing a phospho-intermediate mechanism.",

The transporter alternates between two principal conformations: (1) outward-facing (substrate-binding site exposed to the extracellular side) and (2) inward-facing (binding site exposed to the cytoplasm). Substrate binding on one side triggers a conformational change that closes the initial opening and opens the opposite side, releasing the substrate. At no point are both sides open simultaneously, preventing passive leak. This distinguishes carriers from channels (D), which do form open pores. The carrier does not physically flip in the membrane (C) \u2014 only its conformation changes. The model involves one protein alternating conformations, not two proteins (B).

This specifically collapses the chemical component (delta pH) of the proton-motive force. However, because the exchange is electroneutral (one positive charge in for one positive charge out), it does not affect the electrical component (delta psi). With the delta pH dissipated, the mitochondria compensate by increasing delta psi (the ETC continues pumping protons, but now only the electrical gradient builds up). Since ATP synthase can be driven by either component of the proton-motive force (delta psi + delta pH), ATP synthesis continues but at a reduced rate because the total proton-motive force is somewhat diminished. This contrasts with valinomycin, which selectively dissipates delta psi. Using both valinomycin and nigericin together collapses both components and stops ATP synthesis completely (A would be true for both ionophores together).",

Its small hydroxyl group can also participate in hydrogen bonding, giving it some amphipathic character, but the small size and partial hydrophobicity result in very high membrane permeability. Glucose (A) is larger, more polar, and has multiple hydroxyl groups creating strong hydration shells, making it poorly membrane-permeable (cells need GLUT transporters). ATP (C) is large, highly polar, and carries 3-4 negative charges at physiological pH, making it essentially impermeable.

This mechanical cycle limits transport rates to 100-10,000 molecules per second and exhibits Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics (Vmax and Km). Channels form aqueous pores through the membrane that allow ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient at rates of 10^7-10^8 ions per second (approaching free diffusion in solution), limited mainly by dehydration/rehydration energy. Channels can also show some apparent saturation at very high concentrations but at much higher rates than carriers. Both types exist in all domains of life (D is wrong). Neither exclusively transports one molecular type (A is wrong). Channels do not require ATP (C is wrong).",

The BCA (bicinchoninic acid) or Bradford assays accurately quantify total protein mass. Normalizing to lipid content (measured by phospholipid phosphorus assay) gives the protein-to-lipid ratio, controlling for any changes in membrane amount. Comparing this ratio between undifferentiated and differentiated cells directly answers whether membrane protein content changes during differentiation. Proteomic analysis (mass spectrometry) could additionally identify which specific proteins change. Visual estimation (A) is subjective and non-quantitative. Genome gene counting (C) reflects genetic potential, not actual expression. Cell size measurement (D) does not specifically address membrane protein content, as size increases could be due to cytoplasmic expansion rather than membrane changes.",

This gradient is maintained by: (1) oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and other lipid transfer proteins at membrane contact sites that transport cholesterol from ER to Golgi/PM; (2) vesicular trafficking that preferentially moves cholesterol-rich membranes forward; and (3) cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes in the ER that release newly synthesized cholesterol for transport.

This asymmetry is maintained by ATP-dependent aminophospholipid translocases (flippases) that actively transport PS and PE to the inner leaflet. The distribution is NOT even (B is wrong).

PE can then be transferred back to the ER. This non-vesicular lipid exchange is essential for mitochondrial membrane biogenesis. (2) Calcium signaling: IP3 receptors on the ER release Ca2+ that is taken up by mitochondria through VDAC (outer membrane) and MCU (inner membrane), regulating mitochondrial metabolism and potentially triggering apoptosis.

      "explanation": "The observation that hemolysis occurs over a range of NaCl concentrations (0.45% to 0.30%) rather than at a single sharp threshold demonstrates that erythrocyte populations are heterogeneous in their osmotic fragility. Younger erythrocytes (reticulocytes and newly released RBCs) have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio (more membrane relative to contents), giving them more capacity to swell before reaching their critical hemolytic volume, making them more resistant. Older erythrocytes have progressively lost membrane through vesiculation, reducing their surface area-to-volume ratio and making them more osmotically fragile. This forms the basis of the osmotic fragility test used clinically: hereditary spherocytosis shows increased fragility (hemolysis begins at higher NaCl concentrations) because spherocytes already have a reduced surface area-to-volume ratio. Iron deficiency anemia shows decreased fragility because microcytic cells have relatively more membrane. Option A ignores the heterogeneity demonstrated by the data.",

Proteolytic cleavage of the III-IV linker from the cytoplasmic side also eliminates fast inactivation. The selectivity filter (A) determines ion selectivity, not inactivation gating.

Most IMPs associate with the P-face rather than the E-face, indicating that the transmembrane portions of integral proteins preferentially remain associated with the inner leaflet during fracture.

The full equation is: delta p = delta psi - (2.3RT/F) x delta pH. The negative sign arises because the pH gradient and electrical gradient are defined with opposite conventions: a lower pH outside (positive delta pH when pH_in > pH_out) means more protons outside, which adds to the driving force for proton return. At 37 degrees Celsius, 2.3RT/F = 61.5 mV, so delta pH of 0.75 contributes about 46 mV. In mitochondria, delta psi (~150-180 mV) contributes about 75-80% of the total pmf (~200-220 mV), while delta pH contributes ~20-25%. In chloroplasts, the opposite is true: delta pH dominates.

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Osteoclasts resorb bone by creating an acidic compartment (the resorption lacuna) between their ruffled border membrane and the bone surface. V-type H+-ATPases in the ruffled border pump protons into this space, achieving a pH of approximately 4.5 that dissolves the hydroxyapatite mineral component of bone. Acid-activated cathepsin K then degrades the collagen matrix. If V-type H+-ATPase function is lost, osteoclasts cannot acidify the resorption lacuna and therefore cannot resorb bone, leading to osteopetrosis (marble bone disease) \u2014 a condition where bone density progressively increases because bone formation continues but resorption is impaired. This is the opposite of osteoporosis (A), where excessive resorption reduces bone density. Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis caused by mutations in TCIRG1 (encoding the a3 subunit of the osteoclast V-ATPase) is the most common genetic form. Diabetes (C) and anemia (D) are unrelated to osteoclast V-ATPase function.",

In endothelial cells, Piezo1 senses shear stress from blood flow, triggering Ca2+ influx that activates eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) and promotes vasodilation.

On the apical (luminal) membrane, SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) in the early proximal tubule (S1/S2 segments) reabsorbs approximately 90% of filtered glucose via Na+-coupled secondary active transport. SGLT1 in the late proximal tubule (S3 segment) handles the remaining 10%. The Na+ gradient driving these symporters is maintained by the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. Glucose accumulated inside the cell then exits across the basolateral membrane via GLUT2 (facilitating diffusion down the glucose gradient into peritubular capillaries). GLUT2 (A) is on the basolateral side, not the apical reabsorptive surface. Aquaporin-1 (B) transports water, not glucose. The Na+/K+-ATPase (D) is on the basolateral membrane, not apical.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Despite having a similar ionic radius to Na+, Ca2+ is excluded from gramicidin channels primarily for energetic reasons. Ca2+ has a divalent charge (+2), giving it: (1) a much higher charge density, leading to a stronger and more tightly held hydration shell with a much higher dehydration energy (~380 kcal/mol for Ca2+ vs ~100 kcal/mol for Na+); (2) stronger electrostatic interactions with the carbonyl oxygens lining the gramicidin channel, which create energy wells that trap Ca2+ rather than allowing rapid transit. The narrow pore cannot provide sufficient coordination sites to compensate for the very high Ca2+ dehydration energy, so entry is thermodynamically unfavorable. For Na+, the channel carbonyls can adequately replace the hydration shell. This demonstrates that ion selectivity in narrow channels depends on the balance between dehydration energy costs and ion-channel interaction energies, not simply size. Ca2+ is not physically too large (A). The channel does not specifically bind Ca2+ (B). Gramicidin works in membranes with Ca2+ present (D).",

Brain endothelial cells lack the fenestrations found in many other capillary beds. To supply the brain's enormous glucose requirement (the brain consumes ~25% of total glucose despite being ~2% of body weight), GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is highly expressed on both the luminal (blood-facing) and abluminal (brain-facing) membranes of brain endothelial cells. Glucose crosses by facilitated diffusion: it enters from blood via luminal GLUT1, crosses the cytoplasm, and exits to the brain interstitium via abluminal GLUT1. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (caused by SLC2A1 mutations) results in seizures, developmental delay, and microcephaly due to impaired brain glucose supply. Paracellular gaps (A) are sealed by tight junctions. Fenestrations (B) are absent.

Three Na+ ions flow inward down their gradient while one Ca2+ ion is transported outward against its gradient. S2 is TRUE: The 3:1 stoichiometry (3 Na+ in for 1 Ca2+ out) means there is a net inward movement of one positive charge per cycle, making the exchanger electrogenic. This electrogenicity is important because it makes the exchange rate sensitive to membrane potential. S3 is TRUE: Under conditions of elevated intracellular Na+ (as occurs during ischemia or in the presence of cardiac glycosides that inhibit the Na+/K+-ATPase), the driving force can reverse, causing NCX to operate in reverse mode (Na+ out, Ca2+ in). This contributes to Ca2+ overload and is relevant to the mechanism of cardiac glycoside toxicity. S4 is FALSE: SERCA (SR Ca2+-ATPase) is actually the primary mechanism for Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm in cardiac myocytes (~70% in humans), pumping Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

For a voltage-gated channel, you expect: minimal or no current at hyperpolarized potentials, increasing current amplitude at more depolarized potentials (as more channels open), characteristic activation kinetics that accelerate with depolarization, and a sigmoidal conductance-voltage relationship. Plotting peak current vs. voltage (I-V curve) and fitting a Boltzmann equation to the conductance reveals V1/2 (half-activation voltage) and slope factor.

This causes the three Na+ ions to be released extracellularly. Two K+ ions then bind to the now-exposed high-K+-affinity sites, triggering dephosphorylation (E2-P to E2). The E2-to-E1 transition completes the cycle, releasing K+ into the cytoplasm. ATP binding (B) occurs during E1 state before the transition.

As blood descends into the hypertonic medulla, it loses water and gains solutes (NaCl, urea) by passive exchange, increasing in osmolarity. As it ascends, the process reverses: blood gains water and loses solutes as the surrounding interstitium becomes less concentrated. Because of the countercurrent flow geometry, the net effect is that solutes that enter the descending limb are largely recovered in the ascending limb, and water gained ascending is largely lost descending. This countercurrent exchange minimizes the washout of the medullary gradient by blood flow. If capillaries were impermeable (A), they could not exchange solutes at all.

        "Insulin increases glucose uptake by directly opening glucose channels in the membrane",
        "Insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane via PI3K signaling, and the transport is carrier-mediated (inhibited by cytochalasin B) and dose-dependent",
        "Insulin increases glucose metabolism inside the cell, creating a steeper concentration gradient",
        "Glucose uptake is insulin-independent and relies on simple diffusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data reveal several key features of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake: (1) Dose-dependent stimulation \u2014 glucose uptake increases progressively with insulin concentration (5 to 78 pmol/min), showing a typical dose-response relationship with ~15-fold stimulation at maximal insulin. (2) Cytochalasin B inhibition (78 to 3 pmol/min) demonstrates the transport is GLUT-mediated, as cytochalasin B is a competitive inhibitor of GLUT transporters (it binds the endofacial glucose binding site). The near-complete block below basal levels indicates essentially all glucose uptake requires GLUT proteins. (3) Wortmannin inhibition (78 to 7 pmol/min, near basal) demonstrates that PI3-kinase signaling is required for the insulin response. Wortmannin blocks PI3K, preventing PIP3 generation, Akt/PKB activation, AS160 phosphorylation, and consequently GLUT4 vesicle translocation to the plasma membrane. The data do not support simple diffusion (D), direct channel opening (A), or purely metabolic effects (C).",

      "explanation": "Liposomes are spherical vesicles with a lipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous core, providing two distinct compartments for drug loading. Hydrophilic (water-soluble) drugs like doxorubicin (in Doxil), cisplatin, and nucleic acids are encapsulated in the aqueous interior lumen, protected from the external environment. Hydrophobic (lipid-soluble) drugs like amphotericin B (AmBisome) and paclitaxel partition into the lipid bilayer due to favorable interactions with the acyl chains. Amphipathic drugs may associate at the water-lipid interface. This dual-loading capability is a major advantage of liposomal drug delivery. Drug properties beyond molecular weight \u2014 particularly hydrophobicity (logP), charge, and hydrogen bonding capacity \u2014 determine partitioning. Not all drugs are in the interior (A). Size alone is insufficient (B). Both charged and uncharged drugs can be loaded (D), though remote loading techniques (pH gradient) are used for weakly basic drugs like doxorubicin.",

      "options": [
        "The negative sign means the cytoplasmic side is negatively charged relative to the extracellular side, primarily due to K+ leak channels allowing K+ efflux",
        "A membrane potential of -70 mV means there are 70 millivolts more protons inside than outside",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "By convention, the membrane potential is measured as V_inside - V_outside. A resting potential of -70 mV means the intracellular side is 70 millivolts more negative than the extracellular side. This is established primarily by K+ leak channels (KCNK family two-pore domain channels) that allow K+ to flow down its concentration gradient from inside (~140 mM) to outside (~4 mM). As positively charged K+ ions leave, they create an excess of negative charge inside the cell. The equilibrium is reached when the electrical force attracting K+ back inside equals the chemical force driving it out (approximately -90 mV for K+ alone). The actual resting potential is slightly less negative (-70 mV) because of small Na+ permeability through leak channels. The Na+/K+-ATPase contributes only about -5 to -10 mV directly through its electrogenic 3Na+:2K+ ratio (D oversimplifies). It mainly contributes indirectly by maintaining the ion gradients. Option A reverses the convention. Option C confuses voltage with proton concentration.",

It is a pentameric channel composed of five subunits (alpha2-beta-gamma-delta at the adult neuromuscular junction) arranged around a central ion-conducting pore. When two acetylcholine molecules bind to the two alpha subunits at the subunit interfaces, a conformational change opens the pore, allowing Na+ influx and K+ efflux (with net depolarizing effect), generating an end-plate potential that triggers muscle contraction. The channel opens and closes within milliseconds, enabling rapid synaptic transmission. Other ligand-gated channels include GABA_A receptors (Cl- channels), glycine receptors, glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, kainate), and P2X ATP receptors. Nav1.1 (A) is voltage-gated, not ligand-gated. GLUT1 (C) is a carrier/transporter, not a channel. The Na+/K+-ATPase (D) is a pump, not a channel.",

Sphingomyelinase (acid or neutral) hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, which: (1) activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates and activates pro-apoptotic proteins including BAD; (2) activates ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK/KSR); (3) directly promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; (4) induces formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (large rafts) by self-association of ceramide molecules, which cluster death receptors (Fas, TNF-R) to amplify apoptotic signaling. Ceramide signaling is activated by stress stimuli including radiation, chemotherapy, TNF-alpha, and Fas ligand. It does not activate adenylyl cyclase (A) or PKA (B) \u2014 those are cAMP pathway components.

Early endosomes are characterized by active Rab5, which recruits effectors like EEA1 (early endosomal antigen 1) and the HOPS/CORVET tethering complexes. As maturation proceeds, the SAND-1/Mon1-Ccz1 complex (a Rab5 effector) simultaneously inactivates Rab5 (by displacing its GEF, Rabex-5) and activates Rab7 (by serving as a GEF for Rab7). This switch recruits Rab7 effectors like RILP (which links to dynein for centripetal movement) and the HOPS complex (for lysosome fusion). The Rab conversion is accompanied by progressive acidification (V-ATPase activity), formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs via ESCRT machinery, creating multivesicular bodies), and changes in lipid composition (PI3P to PI(3,5)P2). Clathrin addition (B) occurs at specific microdomains but does not drive maturation. Golgi fusion (C) does not occur. Membrane proteins are sorted, not removed entirely (D).",

      "explanation": "Glycosphingolipid degradation is a lysosomal process. During endocytosis and autophagy, plasma membrane glycosphingolipids (which are in the outer leaflet) end up in the limiting membrane of endosomes. Through the ESCRT-dependent formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), these lipids become accessible to soluble lysosomal hydrolases in the lumen. Within lysosomes, a sequential series of glycosidases (including alpha-galactosidase A) progressively remove sugar residues from glycosphingolipids, aided by sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins) that extract lipids from membranes and present them to the hydrolases. Without functional alpha-galactosidase A, Gb3 accumulates in lysosomes of vascular endothelial cells, podocytes, and cardiomyocytes, causing the multi-organ pathology of Fabry disease. Degradation does not occur at the plasma membrane surface (A, B) or in the ER (D).

        "CO2 is converted to HCO3- before crossing, and bicarbonate transporters carry it across",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "While each C=O bond in CO2 is polar, the linear and symmetric geometry of the molecule means the two bond dipoles cancel exactly, resulting in zero net dipole moment. This gives CO2 sufficient hydrophobic character to partition into and diffuse rapidly through the lipid bilayer. CO2 is also small (MW 44), further facilitating membrane crossing. The permeability coefficient of CO2 across lipid bilayers is approximately 0.35 cm/s, making it one of the most permeable molecules. While some aquaporins (AQP1) and Rh proteins may facilitate CO2 transport in specific tissues (D is partially but not completely correct — it is not the exclusive route), the majority of CO2 crosses by simple diffusion. CO2 does not require specific channel proteins in most tissues (A). While CO2 is converted to HCO3- by carbonic anhydrase for blood transport, this conversion occurs in the cytoplasm, and CO2 itself (not HCO3-) crosses the membrane (B describes intracellular conversion, not the transport mechanism).",

S2 is TRUE: The tonoplast contains two proton-pumping systems: V-type H+-ATPase (using ATP) and H+-PPase (using pyrophosphate, PPi). Both acidify the vacuole to pH ~5.0-5.5, creating a proton gradient for secondary active transport of solutes into the vacuole (via H+/sucrose antiporters, H+/malate antiporters, etc.). The PPase is particularly active in young, rapidly growing tissues where PPi is produced abundantly by biosynthetic reactions. S3 is TRUE: At low external K+ concentrations (<0.2 mM), high-affinity transport systems (including HAK/KUP H+/K+ symporters) operate. At higher K+ (>1 mM), low-affinity inward-rectifying K+ channels (like AKT1/KAT1) provide bulk K+ uptake. S4 is FALSE: Plants do NOT have Na+/K+-ATPase — this is exclusively an animal cell pump.

      "correctAnswer": "TFTT",
      "explanation": "S1: TRUE — The PMF consists of a chemical gradient (pH difference) and an electrical gradient (voltage difference) that together store energy. S2: FALSE — Complex II is the only complex in the ETC that does NOT pump protons; it transfers electrons from FADH2 to ubiquinone without proton translocation. S3: TRUE — Oligomycin binds to the Fo (oligomycin-sensitive) subunit, blocking the proton channel and preventing ATP synthesis. S4: TRUE — UCPs create a proton leak, dissipating the gradient as heat; this uncouples electron transport from ATP synthesis, so ETC runs faster but produces less ATP.",

S2: FALSE — Glycolysis is anaerobic; NAD+ is regenerated by fermentation (ethanol or lactate) under anaerobic conditions, not by oxygen.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The primary role of the ETC is to use energy from electron transfer to pump protons (H+) from the matrix to the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient (proton-motive force). ATP synthase then uses this gradient to drive ATP synthesis. While oxygen reduction (option C) occurs at the end, it is a consequence of electron flow, not the primary purpose.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Rotenone specifically blocks electron transfer from Complex I to ubiquinone, so electrons from NADH cannot enter the ETC. However, succinate donates electrons to Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), which transfers them to ubiquinone DOWNSTREAM of the rotenone block. Therefore, electrons from succinate can still flow through Complexes III and IV to reduce oxygen. This means oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis will continue at a reduced rate (only from succinate-derived electrons, pumping protons at Complexes III and IV but not Complex I).",

      "explanation": "The P/O ratio measures the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation as ATP produced per oxygen atom consumed. For NADH, which enters at Complex I, approximately 10 protons are pumped per NADH, yielding ~2.5 ATP (with ~4 H+ needed per ATP by ATP synthase). For FADH2, which enters at Complex II, only ~6 protons are pumped, yielding ~1.5 ATP. These are theoretical maximum values; the actual ratio may be slightly lower due to proton leak.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The data clearly shows that cyanide reduces O2 consumption to zero in both coupled (+ ADP) and uncoupled (+ FCCP) conditions. This is because cyanide binds to the iron center in Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), blocking the final electron transfer to oxygen. Since no alternative electron acceptor is available, the entire chain backs up and stops. Note that FCCP (an uncoupler) could not rescue respiration in the presence of cyanide, confirming that the block is at the terminal electron transfer step, not at the coupling mechanism.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The respiratory control ratio (RCR) is a key indicator of mitochondrial coupling efficiency. RCR = State 3 rate / State 4 rate. A high RCR (typically > 5 for liver mitochondria) indicates well-coupled mitochondria with minimal proton leak. State 3 represents maximal ADP-stimulated respiration, while State 4 represents the basal leak rate when all ADP has been phosphorylated. An RCR of 7.2 is excellent, showing the membrane is intact and tightly coupled. Damaged or uncoupled mitochondria would show RCR closer to 1.",

To TEST this directly, you need to demonstrate proton transport activity. Reconstituting purified protein X into liposomes and measuring proton flux directly tests the channel function. Option A only shows expression patterns, not function. Option C shows localization, not function. Option D shows homology, not function.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "To pinpoint Complex III inhibition, you need a strategic approach: (1) Use succinate (enters at Complex II) to bypass Complex I — if drug Y inhibits O2 consumption like antimycin A, the block is at Complex III or IV. (2) Use TMPD/ascorbate to donate electrons directly to cytochrome c, bypassing Complexes I-III — if O2 consumption is RESTORED with drug Y present, the block must be upstream of Complex IV (i.e., at Complex III).

Its sole purpose is to regenerate NAD+ from NADH so that glycolysis can continue when the ETC is not available (anaerobic conditions).

S3: TRUE — The PDH complex is regulated by product inhibition: acetyl-CoA competes with CoA, and NADH competes with NAD+. It is also regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.

      "options": [
        "State 1 — basal rate represents maximum coupling efficiency",
        "State 3 — maximal ADP-stimulated respiration with active ATP synthesis",
        "State 4 — low respiration rate means all available energy is stored as ATP",
        "State 2 — substrate availability without ADP demand represents optimal efficiency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "State 3 represents maximal coupled respiration where ADP availability drives rapid electron transport and ATP synthesis. This state shows the highest rate of ATP production with oxygen consumption tightly coupled to phosphorylation (ADP:O ratio of 2.4, close to the theoretical 2.5 for NADH substrates). State 4 represents controlled respiration limited by ADP availability — while coupling is maintained, no net ATP is being produced. State 1 and 2 have low rates because essential components are missing. The transition from State 4 to State 3 upon ADP addition demonstrates respiratory control.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Q cycle is the mechanism by which Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) oxidizes ubiquinol (QH2) and reduces cytochrome c while maximizing proton translocation. In each full Q cycle, two QH2 molecules are oxidized: one electron from each goes to cytochrome c (reducing it), and one electron is recycled to reduce ubiquinone (Q) back to QH2 at the Qi site. The net result is: 1 QH2 oxidized, 2 electrons passed to 2 cytochrome c molecules, and 4 H+ released to the intermembrane space. This doubles the proton-pumping efficiency compared to simple one-electron transfer.",

S2: TRUE — The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle uses cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) and mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (FAD).

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Metformin's mild inhibition of Complex I reduces the ATP/AMP ratio in hepatocytes. The resulting increase in AMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master metabolic regulator. AMPK activation leads to: (1) increased glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation in muscle, (2) inhibition of gluconeogenesis in the liver (by phosphorylating and inhibiting transcription factors like CRTC2 that drive gluconeogenic gene expression), and (3) enhanced fatty acid oxidation.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis, which won the 1978 Nobel Prize, proposed that the energy from electron transport is used to pump protons across a membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient (proton-motive force, PMF). This PMF has two components: a chemical gradient (delta pH) and an electrical gradient (membrane potential, delta psi). The PMF drives protons back through ATP synthase (a molecular turbine), causing conformational changes that catalyze ATP synthesis from ADP + Pi. This was revolutionary because it showed that ATP synthesis does not require high-energy chemical intermediates but instead uses the energy stored in a transmembrane gradient.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Jagendorf equilibrated thylakoids at pH 4 in the dark (no electron transport), allowing protons to accumulate inside the thylakoid lumen to reach pH 4. He then rapidly transferred them to pH 8 buffer containing ADP + Pi. This created an artificial proton gradient (delta pH of 4 units) across the thylakoid membrane WITHOUT any electron transport. ATP was synthesized, providing direct evidence that a proton gradient alone is sufficient to drive ATP synthesis — a key prediction of Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "As oxygen becomes limiting, the ETC slows down because oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor. This causes NADH to accumulate (cannot be oxidized). The most immediate metabolic response is activation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which converts pyruvate to lactate while oxidizing NADH to NAD+. This regeneration of NAD+ is essential because it allows glycolysis to continue producing 2 ATP per glucose — the only ATP source under fully anaerobic conditions. The CAC slowdown (option A) is a consequence, not the first response. Fatty acid oxidation (option C) actually requires more oxygen per ATP than glucose oxidation.",

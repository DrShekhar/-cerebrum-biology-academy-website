      "correctAnswer": "C",

      "correctAnswer": "A",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cellulose cannot be digested by humans because they lack the enzyme cellulase. However, the reason is false — cellulose is an unbranched (linear) polymer of glucose linked by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds (not alpha-1,4).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor structurally resembles the substrate and binds to the active site, competing with the substrate. This increases the apparent Km (more substrate needed to reach half Vmax) but Vmax remains unchanged because at very high substrate concentrations, the substrate outcompetes the inhibitor.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "DNA has deoxyribose sugar which lacks the 2'-OH group present in the ribose sugar of RNA. The 2'-OH group in RNA makes it more reactive and prone to hydrolysis, making RNA labile and easily degradable. This is why DNA is chemically more stable and suitable as the genetic material.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Bryophytes are called amphibians of the plant kingdom because they can live on land but depend on water for sexual reproduction.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Gymnosperms (meaning 'naked seeds') bear ovules that are exposed on the surface of megasporophylls, not enclosed in an ovary. Since there is no ovary, no fruit is formed after fertilization. The seeds remain naked/exposed. The reason correctly explains why gymnosperms do not produce fruits.",

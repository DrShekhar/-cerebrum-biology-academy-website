They are also double-membrane-bound organelles. Both statements are true, but the double-membrane structure is not the reason for their semi-autonomous nature; it is their own genetic material and protein-synthesizing machinery.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cellulose cannot be digested by humans because they lack the enzyme cellulase.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "DNA is chemically more stable than RNA primarily because it lacks the 2'-OH group (it has deoxyribose instead of ribose). DNA does exist as a double-stranded helix with hydrogen bonding between complementary bases. Both facts are true. However, the double-helical structure contributes to structural stability but is not the primary chemical reason for DNA being less reactive than RNA. The absence of the 2'-OH group is the key chemical difference.",

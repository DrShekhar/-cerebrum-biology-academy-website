Starfish (adult is radial but larva is bilateral; NCERT classifies echinoderms as having radial symmetry in adults). However strictly, Starfish adults show radial symmetry. So count = 5 including Starfish. Planaria (bilateral) and Earthworm (bilateral) are not radial. Corrected count = 4 (Hydra, Sea anemone, Jellyfish, Ctenoplana) without Starfish since echinoderms are bilateral in larval stage. Per NCERT, adult echinoderms are radially symmetrical.

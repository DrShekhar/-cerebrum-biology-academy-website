      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Darwin proposed survival of the fittest as the basis of natural selection (I correct). Stabilizing selection reduces variation and favours average/intermediate phenotypes (II correct). Directional selection shifts the mean towards one extreme phenotype (III correct). Disruptive selection favours both extremes, increasing variation and potentially leading to speciation (IV correct). All four statements are correct. NCERT Ch 7, Class 12.",

    options: ['Degeneracy', 'Non-overlapping', 'Ambiguous', 'Universal'],
    correctAnswer: 'Ambiguous',
    explanation:
      'The genetic code is unambiguous, not ambiguous. Each codon specifies only one amino acid. Other characteristics include degeneracy (multiple codons for same amino acid), non-overlapping (codons read sequentially), and universality (same code in almost all organisms).',

    correctAnswer: 'Lysosome',
    explanation:
      'Lysosomes are called suicidal bags because they contain hydrolytic enzymes that can digest the cell itself (autolysis) when the membrane ruptures. This occurs during cell death or when the cell is damaged. The term was coined by Christian de Duve.',

    options: ['GAATTC', 'GGATCC', 'AAGCTT', 'CTGCAG'],
    correctAnswer: 'GAATTC',
    explanation:
      'EcoRI (from E. coli RY13) recognizes and cuts the palindromic sequence GAATTC between G and A on both strands, creating sticky ends with 5 overhang. It was one of the first restriction enzymes discovered.',

    correctAnswer: 'Pachytene',
    explanation:
      'Crossing over occurs during pachytene stage of meiosis I prophase. At this stage, bivalents are fully formed and recombination nodules appear at chiasma points. Crossing over results in genetic recombination between non-sister chromatids.',

    options: ['Sucker', 'Bulbil', 'Offset', 'Runner'],
    correctAnswer: 'Bulbil',
    explanation:
      'In Agave (century plant), vegetative propagation occurs through bulbils - small bulb-like structures that develop in the inflorescence instead of flowers. When they fall on ground, they grow into new plants. This is a type of apomixis.',

    correctAnswer: 'Lungs',
    explanation:
      'Emphysema is a chronic lung disease where alveolar walls are damaged and lose elasticity, reducing the surface area for gas exchange. It is commonly caused by smoking. Patients experience breathlessness, barrel chest, and difficulty exhaling.',

    correctAnswer: 'Commensalism',
    explanation:
      'An orchid growing on a mango tree is an example of commensalism where the orchid (epiphyte) benefits by getting better access to light and air without harming the mango tree (host). The host is neither benefited nor harmed.',

    correctAnswer: 'They synthesize ATP',
    explanation:

    correctAnswer: 'Salvinia',
    explanation:
      'Heterospory (production of two types of spores - microspores and megaspores) is found in Salvinia (aquatic fern) and Selaginella. This is a significant evolutionary step toward seed habit. Pteris, Marchantia, and Funaria are homosporous.',

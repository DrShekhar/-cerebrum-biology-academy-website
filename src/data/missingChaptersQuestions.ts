    question: 'Which of the following is a defining characteristic of all living organisms?',
    options: ['Consciousness', 'Growth', 'Reproduction', 'Metabolism'],
    correctAnswer: 'Metabolism',
    explanation:
      'Metabolism is the defining characteristic of all living organisms. While growth occurs in non-living things (like mountains), and some organisms do not reproduce (mules, worker bees), all living organisms exhibit metabolism - the sum of anabolic and catabolic reactions. Even a cell isolated from the body continues metabolic activities.',

    correctAnswer: 'Carolus Linnaeus',
    explanation:
      'Carolus Linnaeus (Carl Linnaeus) introduced the binomial system of nomenclature in his book "Species Plantarum" (1753) for plants and "Systema Naturae" (10th edition, 1758) for animals. Each species is given a two-part name: genus (generic name) + species epithet (specific epithet).',

    options: ['Mangifera', 'indica', 'Mangifera indica', 'M. indica'],
    correctAnswer: 'indica',
    explanation:
      'In binomial nomenclature, the first word (Mangifera) is the genus/generic name and the second word (indica) is the species epithet/specific epithet. The species epithet is always written in lowercase and italicized. Together they form the scientific name of the species.',

    explanation:
      'Euglena shows characteristics of both plants and animals. Plant-like: presence of chloroplasts, photosynthesis. Animal-like: absence of cell wall, presence of pellicle, heterotrophic nutrition in absence of light, locomotion by flagella. Hence, it is considered a connecting link between plants and animals.',

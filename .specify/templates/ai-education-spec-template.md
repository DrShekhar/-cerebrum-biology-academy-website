# AI Education Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"
**Education Context**: Cerebrum Biology Academy - NEET/Biology focused

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse educational feature description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No educational feature description provided"
2. Extract key educational concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: learners, learning objectives, assessment methods, content delivery
3. For each unclear educational aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific educational question]
4. Fill Learning Scenarios & Educational Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear learning flow: ERROR "Cannot determine learning scenarios"
5. Generate Educational Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be educationally testable with real students
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous educational requirements
6. Identify Key Educational Entities (curriculum, assessments, progress tracking)
7. Run Educational Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has educational uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If tech implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details, focus on learning outcomes"
8. Return: SUCCESS (educational spec ready for technical planning)
```

## ‚ö° Education-First Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on LEARNING OUTCOMES and student success metrics
- ‚úÖ Consider 94.2% NEET success rate maintenance/improvement
- ‚úÖ Design for Indian students (mobile-first, 3G networks, regional languages)
- ‚ùå Avoid technical implementation (focus on educational impact)
- üë• Written for educators, students, and parents - not just developers

### Educational Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must demonstrate clear educational value
- **Revenue Impact**: Every feature must show path to enrollment/retention
- **NEET Alignment**: Must align with Biology curriculum requirements
- **Scalability**: Must work for 10,000+ concurrent students

### For AI Educational Features

When creating this spec from an AI education prompt:

1. **Learning Outcome Clarity**: Mark educational goals that need validation with real teachers
2. **Student Safety**: Ensure AI responses are factually accurate for Biology curriculum
3. **Accessibility**: Consider students with different learning styles and capabilities
4. **Common underspecified educational areas**:
   - Learning outcome measurement methods
   - Content accuracy validation processes
   - Student engagement and motivation strategies
   - Integration with existing curriculum flow
   - Differentiated instruction for various skill levels
   - Assessment rubrics and success criteria

## Learning Scenarios & Educational Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary Learning Story

[Describe the main student learning journey in educational terms]
**Example**: "NEET Biology student struggles with Complex Cellular Processes ‚Üí Uses AI tutor for personalized explanation ‚Üí Understands concept through adaptive questioning ‚Üí Demonstrates mastery through assessment ‚Üí Confidence increases for exam"

### Educational Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** [student knowledge state], **When** [learning interaction], **Then** [educational outcome]
2. **Given** [curriculum context], **When** [AI assistance provided], **Then** [learning progression measured]

### Educational Edge Cases

- What happens when student provides incorrect prerequisite knowledge?
- How does system handle misconceptions in Biology concepts?
- What if AI generates factually incorrect Biology information?
- How does system adapt for students with learning disabilities?

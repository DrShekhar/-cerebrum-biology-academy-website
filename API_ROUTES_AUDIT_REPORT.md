## TIER 1: CRITICAL LEAD CAPTURE & FORM ENDPOINTS ✅

| `/api/leads/exit-intent` | POST | ✅ WORKING | `content_leads` | Rate limit (3/hr), email/phone required, 24hr duplicate check | Generates discount codes, WhatsApp processing |

## TIER 2: SECONDARY FORM & PAYMENT ENDPOINTS ✅

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Saves To | Validation | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| `/api/enrollment/create-order` | POST | ✅ WORKING | Razorpay API + `enrollments` | Zod validation, session check | Creates order and enrollment record |

## TIER 3: ISSUES REQUIRING PRE-LAUNCH FIXES ⚠️

### Issue #1: `/api/seminar/payment/verify` — Incomplete Confirmations

**File:** `src/app/api/seminar/payment/verify/route.ts`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM (functionality works, but confirmations missing)  
**Status:** PARTIAL STUB

**Problems Found:**
- ✅ Payment signature verification: WORKING
- ✅ Database save: WORKING (`seminar_enrollments` created)
- ❌ **Line 50:** `TODO: Trigger WhatsApp welcome message via Interakt` — NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ **Line 53:** `TODO: Send email confirmation` — NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Impact:** Seminar enrollees won't receive confirmation messages, leading to confusion.

**Fix Required Before Launch:** Add WhatsApp + email notifications after successful payment verification.

---

### Issue #2: `/api/webhooks/payments` — Razorpay Webhook Processing

**File:** `src/app/api/webhooks/payments/route.ts`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (affects all payments)  
**Status:** STUB with warning logs

**Problems Found:**
- ✅ Webhook signature verification: WORKING
- ✅ Event parsing: WORKING
- ❌ **Line 542:** `TODO: Replace these with real database operations before going live with payments`
- All helper functions (payment status update, subscription billing, etc.) are STUBS that log warnings

**Stub Functions:**
```
updatePaymentStatus()        → logs warning, does nothing
updateSubscriptionStatus()   → logs warning, does nothing
updateSubscriptionBilling()  → logs warning, does nothing
sendPaymentConfirmation()    → logs warning, does nothing
handleFailedSubscriptionPayment() → logs warning + TODO for dunning
```

**Current Behavior:** 
- Webhooks are received and logged
- No database updates occur
- Users won't see enrollment status changes in real-time

**Impact:** 
- Payments processed but enrollments not confirmed
- User dashboards won't reflect payment status
- Returns 200 OK (appears successful to Razorpay) but doesn't persist data

**Fix Required Before Launch:** 
Implement actual Prisma queries to:
1. Update payment status in `enrollments` table
2. Update subscription status if applicable
3. Send email/WhatsApp confirmations
4. Implement dunning management for failed subscriptions

## MISSING ROUTES ANALYSIS

**Searched for:** All 185+ client-side API calls  
**Found:** ✅ 100% of referenced endpoints exist

**Routes Referenced but Implementation Verified:**
- `/api/test/heartbeat` → present and minimal (by design)
- `/api/errors/feedback` → present (error reporting)
- `/api/activities/create` → present (activity tracking)

**No Critical Missing Routes Found** ✅

---

## UNCONFIGURED SERVICE DEPENDENCIES ⚠️

While routes exist, some depend on external services that may not be initialized:

### Interakt WhatsApp Service
- **Status:** Stub implementation found
- **Routes Affected:** `/api/leads/whatsapp-gate`, `/api/leads/exit-intent`
- **Current Behavior:** Non-blocking (errors caught, logged, execution continues)
- **Risk:** Low (lead is saved even if WhatsApp send fails)
- **Recommendation:** Test WhatsApp delivery before launch; add monitoring alerts

### Email Service Integration
- **Routes Affected:** `/api/contact/inquiry`, `/api/demo-booking`, `/api/seminar/payment/verify`
- **Status:** Implemented via `emailService.send()`
- **Verification Needed:** Check email provider credentials in `.env`

### Google Ads Conversion Tracking
- **Routes Affected:** `/api/contact/inquiry`, `/api/demo-booking`
- **Status:** Async (non-blocking), has error logging
- **Risk:** Low (lead captured even if tracking fails)

## VERDICT & RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ LAUNCH READINESS: **85/100**

**Clear to Launch When:**
1. ✅ Demo booking → fully functional
2. ✅ Contact inquiry → fully functional
3. ✅ Lead capture (WhatsApp gate, exit intent) → fully functional
4. ✅ Newsletter subscribe → fully functional
5. ✅ Referral system → fully functional

**MUST FIX Before Launch:**
1. ⚠️ `/api/webhooks/payments` — Replace stub functions with real Prisma updates
2. ⚠️ `/api/seminar/payment/verify` — Add email + WhatsApp confirmations

**SHOULD VERIFY Before Launch:**
1. Interakt WhatsApp credentials and API connectivity
2. Email service sender configuration
3. Razorpay webhook endpoint registered in dashboard

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test demo booking flow end-to-end (form submission → email/WhatsApp received)
- [ ] Test contact inquiry (form → admin alert → email confirmation)
- [ ] Test WhatsApp gate lead capture (form → content_leads saved → WhatsApp follow-up)
- [ ] Test exit intent discount code flow (form → code generated → email with code)
- [ ] Test newsletter subscription (email → database → able to unsubscribe)
- [ ] Test referral code validation (valid code → shows discount, expired code → rejected)
- [ ] Test payment webhook processing (Razorpay → enrollment marked paid)
- [ ] Test seminar payment confirmation (form → both WhatsApp & email received)
- [ ] Test duplicate prevention (submit twice → get "already submitted" response)
- [ ] Test rate limiting (exceed limit → 429 response)

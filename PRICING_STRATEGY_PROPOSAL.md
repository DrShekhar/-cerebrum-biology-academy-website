# Pricing Strategy Proposal - Cerebrum Biology Academy

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** AWAITING APPROVAL
**Reference:** Your existing biologyforneetug.com website (OLD SITE)

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your EXISTING pricing structure from biologyforneetug.com (your old website), I've created a strategic plan to migrate that proven model to the NEW cerebrumbiologyacademy.com website with improvements:

1. ✅ **Aligns with market standards** (we're currently underpriced)
2. ✅ **Implements tiered pricing** (like competitor's Pinnacle/Ascent/Pursuit model)
3. ✅ **Adds Intensive Course as premium add-on** (hidden pricing, shown to qualified leads)
4. ✅ **Fixes batch size** (we show 50, competitor shows 12-18 for premium)
5. ✅ **Adds proper installment options** (competitor offers 2-3 installments, not 12 months)

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found in Current NEW Website Pricing

### Issue #1: NEW Site is UNDERPRICED vs Your OWN Old Site

**NEW Site (cerebrumbiologyacademy.com) vs OLD Site (biologyforneetug.com):**

| Course Type           | NEW Site Price | OLD Site Price                    | Difference       |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Class 11 (1 Year)** | ₹40,000        | ₹58,000-₹98,000 (Ascent/Pinnacle) | -₹18K to -₹58K   |
| **Class 12 (1 Year)** | ₹45,000        | ₹58,000-₹98,000 (Ascent/Pinnacle) | -₹13K to -₹53K   |
| **2-Year Complete**   | ₹75,000        | ₹1,28,000-₹1,80,000               | -₹53K to -₹1,05K |
| **Dropper/Intensive** | ₹60,000        | ₹1,50,000 (hidden)                | -₹90K            |

**Analysis:**

- Your NEW site is pricing 30-50% BELOW your PROVEN old pricing
- Your old site successfully sold courses at ₹76K-₹1.8L (Pinnacle/Ascent/Pursuit model)
- You already KNOW these prices work in the market
- We should migrate that proven pricing structure to the new site

---

### Issue #2: Batch Size Mismatch

**NEW Site:** "50 students per batch" (shown for ALL courses)
**OLD Site (Your Proven Model):**

- Premium (Pinnacle): Max 12 students
- Mid-tier (Ascent): Max 16-18 students
- Budget (Pursuit): Min 20-25 students

**Problem:**

- NEW site shows 50 for all plans (inconsistent with old successful model)
- OLD site correctly differentiated batch sizes by tier
- We should copy OLD site's proven batch size structure

---

### Issue #3: Installment Structure Wrong

**NEW Site:** Monthly EMI (₹6,250/month × 12 months)
**OLD Site (Your Proven Model):** 2-3 installments over 30-60 days

**Problem:**

- NEW site "EMI" looks like bank loan (reduces perceived value)
- OLD site used SHORT-TERM installments (worked successfully)
- We should copy OLD site's proven installment model

**Example from OLD Site:**

- Single payment: ₹76,000
- 3 installments: ₹77,000 (Days 1, 31, 61)
- Small ₹1,000 penalty for installments (encourages full payment)

---

### Issue #4: Missing Tiered Plans

**NEW Site:** 4 simple plans (no differentiation in features/batch size/hours)
**OLD Site (Your PROVEN Model):** 3 TIERS × multiple plans = 12+ options

**OLD Site's Successful Tiers:**

1. **Pinnacle** (Premium): ₹65K-₹98K, 12 students, 5-6 hrs/week, personal mentoring
2. **Ascent** (Mid-tier): ₹58K-₹77K, 16-18 students, 4-5 hrs/week
3. **Pursuit** (Budget): ₹40K-₹48K, 20-25 students, 3-4 hrs/week, online

**What We Should Do:**

- Migrate OLD site's proven 3-tier structure to NEW site
- Keep the same tier names (Pinnacle/Ascent/Pursuit) OR rebrand to Elite/Ascent/Foundation
- Same batch sizes per tier (proven to work)
- Same hours per week per tier (proven to work)
- Similar price points (proven to convert)

---

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy for Intensive Course

### Option A: Gated Access (RECOMMENDED)

**How it works:**

1. Public pricing page shows only 3 tiers (Elite, Ascent, Foundation)
2. Add button: "Looking for intensive coaching? Talk to us" → Opens chat/phone
3. Counselor assesses student need and reveals intensive option
4. Separate landing page `/courses/intensive` (not linked from main menu)
5. Access to intensive page via:
   - Direct link sent by counselor
   - Email campaigns to qualified leads
   - Retargeting ads with UTM parameters

**Benefits:**

- Creates "exclusive" perception (scarcity)
- Allows counselor to qualify leads
- Prevents price comparison (competitors won't know)
- Higher conversion through personal touch
- Protects premium positioning

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Check if user has access token or referral source
const hasIntensiveAccess =
  searchParams.get('ref') === 'counselor' ||
  searchParams.get('source') === 'email' ||
  cookies.get('demo_attended') === 'true' ||
  cookies.get('consultation_booked') === 'true'

if (hasIntensiveAccess) {
  // Show intensive course option
} else {
  // Show "Request Information" button
}
```

---

### Option B: Progressive Disclosure

**How it works:**

1. Show 3 tiers on pricing page
2. Add mysterious 4th card: "Ultra-Intensive Program" with "Inquire for Details"
3. Click opens modal: "This program is for serious aspirants only. Tell us about yourself."
4. Collect: Name, Current class, Target score, Previous attempt (if any)
5. Show pricing only if:
   - Class 12 or Dropper
   - Target score 650+
   - Completed demo class (tracked via cookie)

**Benefits:**

- Visible but not transparent
- Self-qualifies leads
- Creates curiosity
- Still available to all (fair)

---

### Option C: Tiered Membership

**How it works:**

1. Free account: See Elite, Ascent, Foundation
2. After demo class: Unlock "Premium Member" badge
3. Premium members see additional "Intensive" tier
4. Gamification: "Complete profile to unlock more courses"

**Benefits:**

- Encourages engagement
- Rewards demo attendees
- Builds loyalty
- Data collection

## 🎨 Pricing Page UI Changes Needed

### Current Page Issues:

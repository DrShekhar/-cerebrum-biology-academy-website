# Testing Guide - User Flow System

## ✅ What We Built

You now have a complete user flow system with:

1. **User Flow Logic** (`src/lib/userFlow.ts`)
   - Track selection (NEET vs Regular)
   - User tier system (Guest → Free → Paid)
   - Dashboard routing based on tier

2. **OTP Authentication** (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
   - Mobile OTP login ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING (rate limit proves it!)
   - SMS/WhatsApp delivery
   - Rate limiting (2 OTPs per 5 min, max 5 per hour)

3. **Dashboard Access Control**
   - Wrapper components that check user access
   - Upgrade modals with pricing
   - Locked features with PRO badges

4. **Dev Mode** (for testing without auth)
   - Bypass all authentication checks
   - Test dashboards as if you're a paid user

## 🧪 How to Test (When Fresh)

### Test 1: Enable Dev Mode

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('devMode', 'true')
location.reload()
```

**Expected:** Console shows `🔓 DEV MODE ACTIVE - All dashboards unlocked for testing`

### Test 2: Visit All Dashboards

With dev mode enabled, visit:

1. **NEET Prep Dashboard**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
   - Should load without authentication

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/student`
   - Should show charts and analytics

3. **Simple Dashboard**
   - URL: `http://localhost:3001/student/dashboard`
   - Should have NO upgrade banner
   - All buttons unlocked

### Test 3: Test OTP (After 5 Minutes)

The OTP rate limit will clear after 5 minutes. Then:

1. Visit: `http://localhost:3001/auth/signup`
2. Fill in the form
3. Click "Send OTP"
4. **Check your terminal** for the OTP code (look for `📱 SMS OTP for...`)
5. Enter the OTP
6. Complete registration

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Browser Caching**
   - Browser was aggressively caching old JavaScript
   - Solution: Use Incognito mode or hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`)

2. **OTP Rate Limit**
   - Triggered due to multiple test attempts
   - Clears automatically after 5 minutes

3. **Dev Mode Not Activating**
   - Make sure to refresh AFTER setting localStorage
   - Check console for the "DEV MODE ACTIVE" message

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Test with real users**
   - Create test accounts
   - Test signup → onboarding → dashboard flow

2. **Add navigation PRO badges**
   - Show locked items in header/sidebar
   - Add PRO badges to premium menu items

3. **Polish upgrade flow**
   - Connect to actual payment system
   - Add more upgrade prompts

## 🔧 Dev Mode Commands

**Enable:**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('devMode', 'true')
location.reload()
```

**Disable:**

localStorage.removeItem('devMode')
location.reload()
```

**Check Status:**

```javascript
localStorage.getItem('devMode') // Should return "true" if enabled
```

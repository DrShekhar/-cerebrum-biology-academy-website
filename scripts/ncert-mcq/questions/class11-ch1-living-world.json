      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "According to NCERT, cellular organization is the defining characteristic of living organisms. While growth can occur in non-living things (like mountains), and some living organisms don't reproduce (like mules), all living organisms are made of cells. This is the basis of cell theory.

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Growth in living organisms is intrinsic (from inside) and occurs by cell division, which increases the number of cells. This is called intussusception. In contrast, non-living objects like crystals or mountains grow by addition of materials on the surface (accretion). (NCERT Class 11, Chapter 1, Page 2-3)",

      "explanation": "Viruses can replicate inside host cells but are not considered living because they lack cellular organization and cannot reproduce on their own outside a host.

      "explanation": "The statement 'All living organisms reproduce' is incorrect. Mules, sterile worker bees, and infertile human couples cannot reproduce, yet they are undoubtedly living. Therefore, reproduction cannot be used as the sole defining characteristic of living organisms. (NCERT Class 11, Chapter 1, Page 3)",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The assertion is true - mules are sterile and cannot reproduce. However, the reason is false because reproduction is not a mandatory criterion for being classified as living. Mules are living despite being unable to reproduce. This is why reproduction cannot be the sole defining criterion of life. (NCERT Class 11, Chapter 1, Page 3)",

      "explanation": "The testes are located in the scrotal sac (scrotum), which is a pouch of skin hanging outside the abdominal cavity. This location maintains the testes at 2-2.5°C lower than body temperature, which is essential for spermatogenesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Capacitation is the final maturation process of sperm that occurs in the female reproductive tract (uterus and fallopian tubes). It involves changes in the sperm plasma membrane that enable it to undergo acrosomal reaction and fertilize the egg.",
